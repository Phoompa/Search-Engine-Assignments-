ali baba and the forty thieves once upon time in distant persian city lived two brothers called ali baba and kasim ali baba was terribly poor and he lived with his wife in mud hut he picked up sticks in the woods and sold them in bundles at the market kasim however had rich wife and he lived in big fine house and sold carpets he became richer than ever one day as ali baba was gathering sticks in wood some way from the city he heard band of horsemen gallop towards him scared that he might be in trouble for stealing wood he scrambled up tree and hid amongst the foliage seconds before the men armed to the teeth rode underneath they were robbers no doubt about that ali could tell by their evil looks rough beards and bad language but what made it perfectly clear to him was the booty they unloaded from their horses obviously plundered in raid their leader was grim wickedlooking man followed by his men he strode towards rocky mountain nearby throwing wide his arms suddenly shouted open sesame ali baba could hardly believe his eyes for at the robber words the rock face swung open to become the entrance to deep dark cave the robbers trooped inside dragging their sacks ali baba was struck dumb by this amazing sight and he crouched in his tree without moving muscle he could cahear the robbers voices echo in the cave then out they came again opening his arms the leader exclaimed loudly close sesame and the rock swung tightly shut as they leapt onto their horses and galloped away trembling with fear ali baba climbed down the tree he had just had the biggest shock of his life hardly aware of what he was doing he muttered open sesame but the mountain stood still ali baba said the words again but this time he shouted them suddenly the rock began to move ali baba lit flare and entered the cave in front of his bulging eyes lay vast piles of treasure pots of silver gold precious vases weapons studded with rubbies and emeralds diadems carved plates and carpets all heaped together the poverytstriken stickgatherer rubbed his eyes in disbelief his hand was shaking like leaf as he picked up gold coin it real he said in awe jabbering with excitement and stunned at the sight of such untold wealth he told himself ll take some coins nobody will ever know and he filled four bags full the second he reached home ali baba locked the door and emptied the sacks in front of his astounded wife count them he ordered her triumphantly before telling her what had happened but there were far too many coins for these poor people to count we ca nt count them all run to my brother house and ask him for corn measure we ll use that said ali baba when kasim wife heard this strange request her curiosity was aroused wonder what they want to measure it ca nt be corn they re far too poor and she quickly brushed touch of tar across the bottom of the measuring pail and when she got the pail back there was something stuck to it as the clever woman had known there would be it was gold coin gold coin where did that come from they re the poorest of the poor and she rushed off to tell her husband kasim was most annoyed how dare my brother have gold coins without telling me about it he snapped and off he marched to ask ali baba for an explanation ali baba innocently told kasim his strange story but asked him to keep it secret of course kasim promised but he quickly told his wife about it and ordered the servants to saddle ten sturdy mules for next morning ll be richer than ever incredibly rich he said to himself as he went to bed but he did nt sleep wink for thinking of the treasure it was still dark when kasim and his mule train set out when he reached the mountain beyond the forest he pronounced the magic words and entered the cave with beating heart he crammed as much as he could into the saddle bags but kasim greed led to his downfall for the bags were so stuffed with treasure that they became too heavy to lift kasim realised with sinking feeling that he would have to leave behind some of his precious burden but it took him long time and he was still picking over what to keep and what to abandon when as fate would have it the robber band returned when they saw that the entrance to the cave was open they rushed inside with drawn swords unlucky kasim was quickly discovered and killed and the robbers were so fierce that they chopped hlm into four and left the pieces at the entrance that will warn any other snooper of the end that awaits him shouted the leader kasim wife waited in vain for two days then in desperation she ran to ali baba and told him where her husband had gone asking for help ali baba was dismayed he promised he would never however ali baba was fond of his brother so he saddled mule and rode to the mountain when he saw to his horror the remains of kasim he broke down and wept then he plucked up enough courage to wrap them in rug which he tied to the mule back but kasim wife when she saw what had happened to her husband died of broken heart ali baba and his family went to live in kasim palace there he met morgantina clever young slave girl who had long been servant in the palace it was she who told ali baba that his brother remains could be put together again before being buried mustapha the cobbler would do the job for good reward have to blindfold you morgantina told the cobbler so you ca nt see where you re going then there wo nt be any gossip the cobbler did his work well and was led still blindfolded back to his shop with bag of gold for his trouble in the meantime when the robber leader saw that the body had been removed he knew that someone else had found the treasure trove angry and alarmed he ordered one of his men to sneak into the city and find out what he could well by sheer chance the spy had hole in the sole of his boot and he went into the cbobblers mustapha was bursting to tell someone all about his luck and they gave me bag of gold for stitching the body together again if you take me to the place ll give you another bag of gold said the robber immediately the robber nearly danced for joy then his heart sank how was he to find the house he had never seen ll blindfold you again said the robber then you take your time and try to remember which way you went as it turned out the robber was lucky for mustapha had an exxcelent sense of direction what more he had counted his footsteps so he counted them ahain five hundred and ten five hundred and eleven five hundred and twelve here the cobbler wrenched the cloth from his eyes and found himself in front of ali baba palace the robber handed over the bag of gold and unseen drew red cross on the door then he hurried away to give his leader the news dusk fell and as morgantina was about to enter the palace she noticed the strange mark her suspicions aroused she quickly drew red cross on all the other doors in the street at dead of night the wicked band arrived to take revenge but at the sight of all the red crosses they stopped in their tracks which was the right door morgantina had unknowingly saved her master from death and the leader of the gang put his man to the sword for giving him false lead you fools ca nt you do anything properly ll go to the city myself disguised as merchant he went to mustapha delighted at the idea of earning more money the cobbler took the robber to ali baba palace and the wicked man fixed in his mind the exact place and street back in his hideout he ordered two of his men to buy cart and thirty nine giant jars now after the murder of the messenger there were only thirty eight robbers left and each one hid in jar the last jar was fi led with oil and loaded with the others onto the cart pulled by four horses the robbers set off for the city it was late when they reached the palace and ali baba himself caame out what can da for you he said an oil merchant replied the leader and must be at market tomorrow it late an we re weary can you give us bed for the night pleased at being able to help ali baba who had known what it meant to be poor warmly welcomed the merchant and his men and had the cart taken into the courtyard after good meal the leader of the band went back to the courtyard he said he was going to make sure than none of the jars had been damaged during the journey but in fact he warned his men to be ready at signal to leap from the jars and kill everyone in the palace as the household slept morgantina lingered in the kitchen to tidy up suddenly she thought she would have sip of the merchant oil to see if it was as tasty as her own but when she lifted the lid from the first jar to her horror gruff voice growled is it time no not yet muttered morgantina hastily at every jar exactly the same thing happened but the last one was filled with oil which she dragged back into the kitchen she then tipped the contents into huge cauldron and heated it over the fire then taking jugful of boiling oil morgantina poured it over the head of robber she then poured the oil over every one of the robbers and in this way wiped out the whole band then she hid in corner little later the leader of the robber band hurried into the courtyard to give the signal to attack but when he raised the lids he found to his terror that every one of his men was dead horrified he could not fathorn what trap he had fallen into the robber fled into the night next morning morgantina told ali baba of her adventure ll never be able to thank you enough exclaimed ali baba you are an amazing girl from this second you are no longer slave but free member of this household the dead men were buried under cover of darkness and ali baba was sure he had nothing more to fear the leader of the robber band however had recovered from his shock and was eager for revenge so he shaved off his beard changed his looks and disguised himself as carpet seller at the market he met tabit ali baba son who took llklng to him sooner or later this silly chap will invite me home said the false carpet seller then can murder them all that merchant has sold you some fine carpets very cheaply remarked ali baba to his son ask him to come to the house when morgantina saw the guest she felt sure his face was familiar then she remembered the carpet seller and the leader of the band were one and the same person without saying word she went back to the kitchen but later she asked all baba if she might dance for the guest if you like said ali baba when coffee was served morgantina entered in swirl off veils to the beat of her tambourine in her right hand she held knife as she stopped dancing she thrust the knife into the carpet sellers heart he one of the robbers she cried know his face he would have killed us all morgantina had once more saved their lives tabit hugged her little knowing that his joy would soon turn to love and that they would marry ali baba was the only person left who knew the secret of the treasure he made wise use of it for many years but he never told anyone the magic words that would open the cave of the forty thieves
