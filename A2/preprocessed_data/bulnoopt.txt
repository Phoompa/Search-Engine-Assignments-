left by daniel flower before you say anything know what did was wrong freely admit that can but wish that it had never happened unfortunately the hands of time continue to move forward turning back for no man am not criminal you know that sure there were the few shoplifting incidents when was younger but susan had seen me one day needless to say you were hardly amused by the situation other than that only have few traffic tickets on my record up until now have been proud of that fact it is amazing what man will do when his back is against the wall could have lived with paying six hundred dollars month in child support could have lived with the three hundred dollar reduction in salary due to that transfer could have lived with the forclosure of the house after all wasnt living there anymore because of the transfer but could nt live with the fact that loretta moved back with her parents because she wanted to get college degree and could nt help her know that it is passe these days for man to feel as if he has to be the sole bread winner in family but not being able to afford to give loretta what she wanted really hurt the least could have done would be to take care of the bills so she could put her salary towards her degree here we were scrimping and saving to makie ends meet and not even married yet only wanted the best for her tried to remain cheerful and supportive when she told me what her plan was even tried to make it work for couple of months but again money problems entered the picture just did nt have the money to see her every weekend lonliness set in things probably would have stayed the same going to see her when could just getting by if had nt had that crazy idea never would have had the idea if had nt gone to the atm machine that day it was nt machine normally use try to use the one at my bank was at the mall and needed some money for gas so decided use the machine at the mall and get gas on the way home anyway while was making my withdrawal they came to fill the machine always wondered how they did it and now knew the idea did nt come to me right away at least not to my conscious mind it was nt until was home that the lightning struck was looking at my bills wondering how was going to pay them when the thought came to me why not ambush the team that fills the atm machines argued with myself for days and needless to say it was an argument that lost the plan was simplicity in itself wait by the machine until they came to fill it and then take the money all needed was gun and time schedule for when the filled the machines two people had filled the machine that day at the mall one carried brief case and the other was an armed uniformed guard figured that if got the drop on them there would be no problem went to gun shop and bought 380 baretta semiautomatic used one before and it fit the bill nicely it was small and light weight but looked ugly enough to get someone attention did nt bother to try to use an alias was nt planning on using it if it came to that hightail it out of there and think of something else it took ten days to get the gun because the police had to do check on me to make sure was nt an excon or something while waited for the gun watched the atm machine decided to go with the machine at the mall it was located near side exit and that end of the mall was nt too busy during the day was nt in hurry and could wait until there were nt too many people nearby discovered that they came every other day to fill the machine and that they came at the same time the gun was ready the day the shop keeper had promised went in and tested it out on the indoor range more because it was expected of me than anything else was finally ready went to the mall and waited made sure that had used different location to watch from everyday so that wouldnt attract attention my opportunity came on the third visit there was no one near the machine and had to time it so that arrived at the machine before the person with the brief case went into the service area in the back to fill the machine it went just like planned neither one made fuss when showed them the gun took the guard gun and had them face the wall told them kill them if they made sound and to count to two hundred before moving was shaking as drove away never been that scared started shaking again after counted the money 85000 not bad for day work and more than enough to put loretta through college she caught ride up with one of her friends today in order to spend the weekend with me bought some nice steaks and bottle of wine after we eaten explained what id done and why thought about what say to her to explain my sudden windfall and decided to tell her the truth cant lie to her really though she be happy but she was nt she called me scum and few other choice explatives she told me had to turn myself in or she do it herself guess lost my head after all had done it for us so we could be together she had no reason to be so mad hit her she fell and hit her head on the table it did nt take me long to sober up after that she was dead could nt believe it picked her up and carried her into the bedroom laid her gently in the bed and looked at her for what seems hours but what was probably closer to five minutes then sat down and wrote this to you there not much left to do mom ll call the police first of course dont want us to be found in few days and do nt know if the neighbhors will hear the shot from the 380 guess there nothing left to say except sorry give my love to everyone for me your loving son greg copyright 1987
