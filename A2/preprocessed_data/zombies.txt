mail 539 leroy ferndale mi 48220 zombies dedicated to george romero filmmaker magnifique chapter caryn looked around the store and sighed another long slow boring midnight at gasnmore being fulltime college student made working the graveyard shift necessary but that did nt mean she had to like it yawn caught her by surprise and she glanced up at the marlboro clock over the wide glass doors twenty to three the afterbar rush had tapered off and until about fivethirty or so she would nt see more than half dozen people then would come the factory workers in for their sandwiches donuts coffee smokes and gas all of which was ready and waiting she refilled her coffee cup and made another pot then took two nodoz she had so much caffeine in the last five months since starting midnights that it barely had any effect on her any more other than stopping her yawns going behind the counter she set her cup beside the ashtray beneath it lit newport leaned back against the register and gazed out the bank of long glass windows at the big brightlylit sign out front and gas pumps no traffic moved beyond them though the gas stationmini mart was located at the junction of two major streets and freeway it was surprisingly slow at night most of the people who came in at this time were cops for their free coffee and soda they kept an eye on her knowing that she was alone all night that was nt really necessary she thought few people stopped in tiny berkley park off the interstate since there was rest stop two miles back actually caryn thought as she glanced over at the thick textbook on the other side of the ushaped counter this does work out great if only could get more sleep but that what have to put up with staying in the dorm and sleeping in the afternoon after classes get paid to study while here more or less and carrying 40 grade average two more years and ll be home free highpaying job at the hospital car and place of my own and probably new boyfriend long before all that if dave does nt quit his shit but right now need him to drive me back and forth until can afford to get car she felt the familiar depression settle over her at the thought of him and smashed out her cigarette roughly teenage couple came in just then giggling and holding onto each other both wearing brown and yellow jackets from the high school the same good old beaumont high caryn had graduated from three years ago herself these kids seemed so young and immature she thought welcoming the distraction from her thoughts she not only waited on them but talked with them for few minutes about the school and teachers they knew when they were gone she eyeballed the thick biology textbook again but it was friday night and she had the next two days off so why study now no she decided this would be junk night leaning over the counter she grabbed copy of the national enquirer from the rack on the other side of the register and was soon absorbed in other people problems ryan callahan was having rough night if it was nt bad enough that he had fight with mike and anita after driving all the way up here to stay with them for the weekend he gotten pulled over for speeding now sitting on his bike with the cop behind him checking his license he went to light cigarette and discovered that his box of winstons was empty it was great fucking night all right the cop walked up and handed ryan license and registration paper over you ve got clean record so going to let you off this time but watch the speeding there been some bad accidents on this freeway because of it ryan was surprised and knew how easily he gotten off the fake insurance certificate had held up thanks officer will but as he pulled off the shoulder and back onto i24 he saw that the cop stayed right behind him his speedometer needle sat steadily at fiftyfive until he saw an exit ramp ahead with the name of some town he never heard of over it and brightlylit gas station sign not far away from the freeway ll get smokes there and dodge this cop he headed for the sign making complete stop at the end of the ramp instead of his usual glanceandgo but the cop still followed as he turned into the gas station yup great fucking night the clerk looked up from behind the counter as the door signal burred and said good morning ryan grunted and walked past her to the coolers staring in at the frozen foods asshole caryn thought and decided to keep an eye on him with that long hair and torn jeans he looked suspicious and though the store had never been robbed that she knew of there was always the possibility that it could happen relief flooded through her as she saw the white and blue police car pull up outside the door signaled again and she said hi frank how your night going not bad how about you officer frank zambone and she were friends after both working the graveyard shift for the past few months the other midnight cop mike boujenah was more formal and aware of his duties but if it was slow frank would stand in the store and talk to her keeping his radio on and listening for the rare call oh slow as always she said flicking her eyes in the direction of the suspicious guy and he nodded slightly satisfied caryn flipped back couple of pages in the tabloid she been reading and pointed out story about zombies in south america which were reportedly heading up into the united states would you look at this ryan stared in unseeingly at frozen pizzas burritos and egg rolls seething in silence why did nt that asshole cop leave he and the clerk were laughing over something but he could feel eyes boring into his back he moved over to the next glass door barely seeing the premade sandwiches there not wanting to leave until after the cop did but knowing he looked suspicious being all alone in here with the girl cashier especially since he driven up here straight after work at midnight in his grubby work clothes and though he was used to the prejudice anyone on motorcycle got he did nt like it but as it sank in what he was seeing he decided to get something to eat so he look less suspicious and now that he thought about it he was hungry if that cop decided to take another good long look at his insurance certificate he might see that the date had been whited out and retyped in and ryan could nt afford to have his harley impounded now not out in the middle of nowhere ohio he had couple hundred dollars on him his entire paycheck but most of it was for his rent and not to bail himself out of jail he grabbed large submarine sandwich and walked across the store to the soda coolers hearing the cop radio crackle and hoping he gotten call and would leave caryn watched as frank answered the call frowning as he asked the dispatcher to repeat the code what at the graveyard tenfour on my way he turned to her ve got to go there disturbance out at eternal rest probably some kids goofing around but the caretaker called and said something about graves being dug up so ve got to go check it out lowering his voice he added with glance across the store do nt hesitate to push that button if he starts anything caryn wo nt hope it nothing serious she replied but felt worm of trepidation coil in her stomach she simply did nt like the look or attitude of the man who was reaching into the pepsi cooler ll be back as soon as can the cop said as he hurried out to his squad car then took off with his lights flashing but the siren off ryan walked up to the counter and set down his sub large bag of doritos twoliter of pepsi and tossed in snickers for good measure the clerk small slender girl who almost looked ludicrous in an orange and brown smock two sizes too large smiled at him and said will that be all but the smile did nt reach her cold dark eyes and he could feel the dislike coming off her in waves but that was okay because he did nt like her either yeah no wait gim me two packs of winston box if ya have it too he pulled out his wallet and threw ten dollar bill on the counter that cop friend of yours her fingers danced over the register keys lightly as she answered yeah he works midnights too that ll be twelveohseven what ryan leaned over to see the numbers on the register window for himself for this you got ta be kidding she stiffened angry every other person who came in the place complained about the prices but what did they expect from twentyfourhour convenience store here was another idiot she like to poke in the eye with screwdriver the only kind of weapon she had in the store cigarettes are two bucks pack the soda twotwentynine chips re twofiftynine candy sixty cents and the sub twofiftynine plus tax smartass bitch ryan thought annoyed she was stuffing his things in white plastic sack as he pulled his wallet out again and tossed three singles by the ten grumbling how much dya charge for gas five bucks gallon dollar eighty she said shortly getting the cigarettes from the rack over her head she wished either he leave or frank would come back he did nt like customers smarting off to her and usually said something when they did dya have microwave ryan asked taking the sub out of the bag and breaking the plastic wrap open got long ride tonight and ai nt eating this cold damn caryn thought but she pointed over there right next to the frozen coke machine later both of them never forgot that moment the last normal time of their lives before the world irreconcilably changed the door burred and caryn looked over froze then screamed at the top of her lungs startled ryan whirled around dropping his submarine and stared with his mouth hanging open man had walked into the store and as the door swung closed on hydraulic pressure behind him it had torn off half the heel on his bare right foot the chunk of meat slid outside as the door completed its function but the man did nt react since he had quite obviously been dead for while and did nt feel it he was dressed in black suit white shirt and maroon tie that were liberally caked with green slime and his skin was pasty greenishwhite with mold growing here and there he lurched toward the counter but seemed unaware of it and bumped into the magazine rack that fronted the register knocking copies of the national enquirer weekly world news star and globe to the floor as they fell ryan spotted one headline that caught his eye zombies reported in south america pix inside south america he thought crazily they sure migrated fast cause this dude is surely dead as dogshit and smells even worse slipping on the papers the ghoul tried for the counter again and managed to bump cigarette display aside with one stiff flailing arm the girl had backed up as far as she could go and was flattened against the lotto machine hands over her mouth eyes bulging like brown marbles in her face the critter was after her ryan realized it wanted to eat her like he was going to eat his sub only the zombie did nt have to nuke his intended meal to warm it up and once he noticed the break in the counter only foot or so to his left he would be able to get his dirtcaked green paws on his prey without thinking about it ryan reacted running around the outside of the counter he swung the heavy bag in his hands the twoliter of soda catching the zombie glancingly on the side of the head and knocking him down the weight of the bag made ryan stagger and when he turned back the critter was slowly jerkily getting back up one side of its head looking oddly crushed but still intact its flat colorless eyes now on him fuck he said looking around again without thinking acting on sheer primal instinct which said run if you ca nt fight ryan darted around the counter and grabbed the girl by the arm she was wideeyed and pale with shock and felt like moveable doll under his hand cmon we got ta get out of here he said pushing her toward the windows and urging her to climb the counter there was only one break in it and the ghoul was too close to that for them to be able to use it he urged her over then followed twisting his ankle in the wooden magazine racks that fronted the counter he sprinted past her to the doors flung one wide and yelled cmon you goofy bitch is nt the smell enough for you caryn eyes were wide and shiny blank now she followed him docilely out the doors and past the gas pumps under the high roofs on struts over them and out to the street ryan paused and looked in both directions but the long black road was dark and deserted across from the gas station was cheap strip mall all the stores dark and silent while to his left was the freeway and on the right mexican restaurant nothing moved in the eerie dense silence he glanced back over his shoulder and saw the zombie still bumping around inside the store his rakish harley parked just to the right of the doors the urge to get on the bike and just go hop on that freeway and escape this madness was strong in him yet ryan could nt do that his fear of the unknown was greater than what he already knew as threat he saw little or no choice whatever was happening it was in both their best interests to go back in that store get rid of the ghoul and stay put until the cops came back or something else happened he grabbed the cashier by the arm again and turned her around not seeing the slack blank look of shock on her face as they walked back across the parking lot he explained what they had to do looking around to make sure more of the rotting fuckers were nt coming at them as he pushed the doors open and shoved her in before him ryan grimaced at the stench that filled the store as if hundreds of pounds of hamburger had gone rancid the zombie was on the other side of the counter near the frozen coke and fountain soda machine and turned its head to look creakily at them as they again climbed behind the counter to relative safety nothing to use as weapon in sight ryan looked around behind the counter glancing at the girl but she looked frozen in shock and did nt move the zombie which obviously was nt running on all cylinders managed to wander back their way and bumped straight into the counter again this time knocking the cigarette display off grunting in flat desperate tone do you have knife gun anything can use to stop that fucker ryan said desperately wondering if the thing would ever figure out how to get behind the counter but even if it did nt it had to go because the putrid gassy smell was about to make him puke bitch wake up and help me he yelled going over to shake her come on think that thing sees us as chow and we re gon na be its chow if we do nt kill it for good the zombie bumped the counter again ineffectively then looked down and saw what was stopping it gears seemed to grind in its rotting brain and it raised one knee trying to climb over it caryn was thinking of how she often thought of poking people in the eye with screwdriver usually customers who gave her hard time like this idiot since that was the only weapon of any kind in the store you had to stop their brains to kill them she thought dazedly and managed to say there screwdrivers hanging over the sink in the back room cmon show me ryan turned and vaulted the counter beside the lotto machine then tugged at her shoulder climb over that ll confuse old deadbrain there long enough for us to get them feeling like she was trapped in someone else body who had massive novicane shot caryn did as he said and led him into the back room over stainless steel double sink was rack of screwdrivers ranging from tiny to huge and with an exclamation of triumph ryan grabbed twofootlong phillips this ll do you stay back here and lock the door behind me in case it gets me instead of me gettin it that door does nt lock caryn said woodenly then come on what you take lude wake up bitch deal with it here take this we got ta kill that fucker and lock them doors before more come ryan thrust slightly smaller straightslot into her slack hand which closed over the screwdriver mechanically and went to the doorway to the store proper shit he corralled now how we gon na get im caryn peered around him hesitantly the zombie was wandering around behind the counter bumping into it apparently having forgotten how it gotten in there in the first place its blindly waving hands knocked over rack of greeting cards then bumped the lottery machine and ticket popped out that one probably winner ryan muttered and shook his head well what dya think the thought of more things like that invading the store trapping them galvanized caryn to action though she did nt think there were more that this was an isolated incident guess ll be bait she said slowly you can creep up behind it how that the smile he turned on her surprised caryn when he was nt frowning this was one handsome guy thatta girl let do it before pass out from the smell no kidding she agreed then took deep breath and better grip on the screwdriver and walked out into the store hey you she said hesitantly cringing when the zombie looked over at her and drooled cmon thing you want me come and get it she sidled over to the break in the counter glancing behind her to make sure she had plenty of escape room the front door was only few feet away and she decided to break for that the idiot biker might think there were more but caryn doubted it one zombie was enough to stretch her brain to the breaking point and there was no way she was going to consider that there might be more outside ryan stayed in the doorway until the thing was out from behind the counter reaching for the girl who was backing away at the same rate it came at her he revised his opinion of the clerk seeing that she was showing some balls now when the critter was about two feet in the clear he moved running up behind it and driving the long metal screwdriver into the back of its head the zombie skull simply fell apart grayishgreen mush splattering in all directions as the body lost all animation and fell down decently and fully dead both of them backed away ryan grossed out over the putrid shit that had splashed on him caryn turning away and retching but she did nt vomit get rid of that before puke she said chokingly and ran into the back room ryan shrugged so much for her balls but they been there when it mattered he grabbed one of the zombie arms and pulled but it came off fuck dunno if can the thing falling apart like jigsaw puzzle but he finally thought to grab the shoulders of its suit jacket and managed to drag it out the front doors then paused and looked around the silent area no one or nothing moved not even car maybe should just go blow this place but who knows what going on everywhere else it could be worse and if got ta be trapped somewhere during zombie epidemic at least this place warm and full of food and beer could be worse is right he closed the double glass doors and twisted the knob making sure they were locked by jiggling them okay it gone he called and she walked out of the back room with her face white as sheet now what do we do you think know it probably best if we just sit tight and wait and see what goin on do you have radio she nodded and went behind the counter kicking aside greeting cards and packs of cigarettes and pulled small black and silver jambox from beneath the counter it not police band but there should be something about what going on she said as she set it on the counter and plugged it in but only regular music and talking greeted her sweep across both am and fm dials nothing unusual but she left it on an easy listening station she sometimes listened to low shit wonder what going on frank got call to go to the graveyard just before he left frank oh you mean the cop dunno hey can you turn off the sign ryan turned and pointed out the glass windows that might be why that thing came here it sure could nt smell us in here yeah all right she agreed going into the back room moments later the big lit sign out by the street went dark then the lights over the gas pumps and finally the pumps themselves ca nt turn out the lights in here or the coolers go they re all on the same switch know cause we had power outage before and everything went hmmn see what you re sayin we re like big sign sayin smorgasbord here to them critters when they see the store lit up even if the sign off what do you mean them critters how can you logically think there more of them out there and do nt even think that was zombie maybe some kind of sick joke just because we saw one whatever it was does nt mean there more ryan was getting annoyed jesus what re you vulcan never heard such cold logic in my life from somebody who was so terrified they could nt move ten minutes ago like you said ve got to deal with it caryn snapped back and no not vulcan college student oh god help me an intellectual ryan sighed and turned away another knowitall screw you buddy caryn snapped you do nt like it here leave sure do nt want you here my name ryan ryan callahan he said disliking being called buddy caryn jackson she said her anger draining out okay so what now we wait until something happens yeah guess so unless you like to take your chances in zombieland he shrugged happy here god do you have to be such smartass she frowned going to refill her coffee cup wish you would leave cause already sick of you same here though caryn did nt want him in the store she had no way to make him leave and hoped that frank would come back by and make him go she carried her cup of coffee behind the counter and as she set it down her eyes fell on the telephone and widened the phone damn why did nt think of it sooner ryan had picked up his bag took out pack of winstons and his bottle of soda and was sitting up on the counter near the lottery machine smoking and tapping his ashes on the floor he took drink from the large bottle wiped his mouth with the back of his hand belched and said waddia gon na do call the cops and tell em we killed dead guy they sure believe that hearing normal dial tone in her ear caryn punched in the numbers for the dorm first calling home to see if anyone up shit it busy probably marsha talking to jeff for half the night again she pressed the cutoff button then glanced over at him as matter of fact that good idea the cops might ryan was torn by indecision on one hand he did nt want her to call them because if they came out again they might just check his insurance certificate and that be the end of his harley on the other hand gun and authority might come in handy if more of those things were wandering around out there which to him there were as far as maeve callahan third son ryan was concerned if there was one there was more caryn dialed the police station getting busy signal and tried again the other end rang then tired voice said berkely park police sergeant boujeneh speaking mike this is caryn down at the gas station has anything unusual been happening this had better be important caryn ve been getting lot of prank calls tonight ca nt contact frank and not in the mood for any shit her heart began to pound the receiver trembling in her hand as it shook about zombies it not prank mike we saw is frank there with you he snapped angrily no customer is staying here because that enough too busy for this shit he hung up and caryn stared at the phone in disbelief he hung up on me he did nt believe me he said he been getting prank calls about zombies then there must be more ryan said frowning caryn maybe we should get on my the sound of squealing tires clear in the silence made both of them turn toward the windows headlights were turning into the gas station dark parking lot wavering and bumping as the car jumped two of the parking blocks and suddenly accelerated across the blacktop toward the building it barely missed set of gas pumps and ryan yelled in horror as he saw it heading straight for his harley but he did nt have time to even move as it crashed into his bike and then hit the building smashing the large motorcycle between it and the bricks the store shook and bottles clinked in the cooler several items falling off the shelves as he sprinted for the door forgetting he locked them ryan shook the doors lost in fury and screaming threats at the unseen driver just as he unlocked the doors the car driver door opened and someone dressed in dark clothing fell out onto the blacktop caryn who was behind ryan saw who it was and screamed frank oh no frank still furious about his bike but suddenly remembering the danger they were in ryan calmed himself with stupendous effort and relocked the doors staring out he watched as the cop dragged himself up off the ground and staggered toward them ole frank the cop had had runin with zombie maybe more than one it looked like blood covered his dark blue uniform turning it black big chunks of flesh were missing from his neck and arms his shirt torn and hanging in shreds to show raw flesh beneath he staggered toward the doors and collapsed again only foot away then lifted the top half of his body and stretched one arm toward them through the glass they could barely hear his voice help me came to warn you caryn things zombies it trailed off and he fell facefirst onto the pavement and did nt move again ryan suddenly staggered sideways from shove and fell against stack of soda crates the bottles clinking caryn still screaming was fumbling with the door lock we ve got to help him he pushed her away from the doors with less force than she used on him and held the handles securely as he turned to face her what are you nuts he dead and now he gon na turn into one of those things looks like he went coupla rounds with zombie george foreman do nt you watch movies once you re bit by those things and die you turn into one of em she bit her lip crossing her arms over her chest and shuddering looked over his shoulder outside then she froze unable to speak ryan turned his back to the doors and took couple steps away frowning thinking about his bike and wondering if the cop at the station would believe them now caryn was staring at shambling group of zombies crossing pressburg road toward the gas station five or six only their forms distinguishable in the dark but there was no doubt that they were zombies just the way they stumbled and lurched gave that away she would ve known something was wrong just by the way they were walking if it could be called that and they were arrowing straight for the store lights at snail pace but it was fast enough for her ruh ruh she forced out and managed to point her mind back to being on novocaine he looked up annoyed then noticed the pallor of her face caryn what he turned and saw them right away oh fucking shit critter patrol how thick are those doors not thick enough she managed to say holding onto herself with dint of will wanting only to run out the back door and never stop running kid broke one of them with skateboard last month we ve got to block them off then ryan said the zombies were just crossing the sidewalk and the lead one was stumbling over concrete parking block into the lot we might have enough time what can we use do nt know caryn eyes swept over the front of the store and she shrugged soda crates ryan pointed to the displays of coke pepsi 7up and faygo stacked up against the front windows to the left of the doors which he fallen against when she shoved him away from the doors it looked like there been recent delivery since the crates each containing three eightpacks of bottles were stacked eight and ten high cmon help me even if they break the windows it ll take em while to get past these as she went to help caryn eyes were on the five zombies skipping over frank motionless body which had reached the gas pumps about ten feet from the front of the building none of them seemed to be connected to reality as two were repeatedly bumping against the gas pumps apparently unaware that all they had to do was step around them while another had fallen over one of the concrete parking blocks and was still trying to walk facedown on the ground one woman who was missing her jawbone and had dark gaping hole below her exposed front teeth lurched steadily toward the lit store with determination unaware that half her coffin was still attached to one of her legs and being dragged along behind her the fifth zombie was lurching along in the lead but stumbling slowed by missing foot they stacked the soda crates in front of the doors leaving most where they were to protect the windows though they were much thicker than the door glass and built wall about five and half feet high ryan arms ached and his back was sore when they got done but both felt much safer with the crates blocking the doors as they rested leaning against the crates something bumped in the night caryn peered between the bottles being much shorter than the wall here they come ryan looked over the top being sixone one of the critters was still bumping against pump but the other four had achieved their goal and were fumbling around with the door handles stumbling over the cop body and ignoring it they stacked the crates tightly against the doors which opened inward and since they were locked they did nt bump against the crates so unless the glass was broken there was no danger of them being knocked over the zombies scratched and bumped uselessly against the glass one of them having the intelligence to try and pull on the doors but when that did nt work it went back to beating its hands uselessly on the glass think it ll hold caryn said with relief do nt think they re strong enough to break it yeah and the way the one dragged outside fell apart bet they come apart before they were able to break the glass ryan agreed grimacing at the memory and glad that he put the first zombie body and parts on the side of the store ugh do nt remind me caryn shuddered moving away from the barricade now guess we wait ryan stomach growled as he leaned against the crates his back to the thumping zombies going to get something to eat where my sub go that thing stepped on it so threw it away get another since you did pay for it she said going behind the counter but her eyes kept straying to the partiallyseen forms beyond the glass do nt think could eat right now they re gross but still hungry and do nt plan to starve to death in store full of food ryan said going to the sandwich cooler and taking out roast beef sub that cost dollar more than the bologna and salami one he paid for caryn watched unobtrusively as he heated up the submarine and hopped back up on the counter to eat he also gotten large bag of redhot chips and another cold bottle of pepsi from the rack without paying and she decided to keep track of what he ate and charge him for it later there was bound to be rescue and things would go back to normal so he was nt going to eat all night for free she tried to turn her attention to magazine but it was dry and boring and the zombies still bumping against the doors and windows outside kept distracting her tabloid might have kept her interest better than newsweek but she read all of them already caryn have you thought of what we ll do if no one comes by morning obviously the cop you talked to does nt believe us ryan said wiping his mouth on piece of paper towel and tossing his empty wrapper in the trash mean who knows how many of these things are on the loose or how widespread it is it ca nt be happening just around here had to do research on american burial traditions for my cultures class last year and in case you do nt know we bury people in two caskets there the one you see at funeral and it lowered into cement box that has heavy lid that law ryan and everyone who is nt cremated or put in crypt is done like that so do nt think that the graveyard empty because most of them probably ca nt get past the cement lid on the second casket how you find all that out ryan asked curiously still eating hot chips went over to the graveyard and asked the caretaker he even gave me tour of the place and answered all my questions got an on that term paper too caryn went and poured herself another cup of coffee when she came back she added even the ones in the crypts ca nt get out the doors are locked against vandalism especially around this time of the year halloween in two weeks yeah no shit now that you mention it get real what halloween got to do with this shit going on just think how this looks in some european countries where they re still real superstitious they must angrily caryn interrupted for all we know it local thing ca nt believe the whole world is being invaded by killer zombies can cause it better than believing in false hopes he snapped back never think things are going to be good cause when they are nt you just got kicked in the face again look at my fucking bike out there just got it fixed caryn stared at him momentarily jesus are you ever pessimist you have control over things that happen to you you know if you do nt put yourself in position to get now he interrupted her oh yeah how have control over the fact that my mother abandoned me and my brothers when was five and was raised in an orphanage that was great start caryn believe me and it has nt gotten any better no matter how hard ve worked at it so do nt spout that bullshit about control to me he finished angrily halfshouting she recoiled and felt tears well up ii sorry she said frowning trying to stop herself from crying she never been able to take man angry voice not after her father it had seemed that he was always yelling at one or the other of them but she lost the fight and before she could wipe it away single tear coursed from the corner of her eye and down her cheek she ran into the back room where there was small bathroom and locked herself in why have to get locked in here with an uneducated bullheaded biker jesus why not frank or jim or even dave ryan watched her go with amazement replacing his anger the goofy bitch had been crying over stupid argument of all the people on earth he could have gotten stuck with during an unexpected emergency like this why her sure there were worse people the soontobeazombie cop would ve been but she was nt his dream girl that was for sure well at least she was nt bad to look at that was something she could have looked like the fat and pimpledotted clerk who worked midnights at the 7eleven near his house but at least that woman was an interesting conversationalist and did nt treat him like shit because he had long hair and rode bike or even better he could have been home in his comfortable little house but then it had lot of windows that he would have had to board up and he might have ended up like most people in zombie movies he seen ghoul fodder caryn came out of the back room with her face blotchy and eyes red and would nt look at him instead heading back to the long walllength walkin cooler and disappearing inside moment later he heard the blowers stop and the lights inside went on he caught glimpses of her in there between the rows of shelves and realized with some amazement that she was filling the cooler in his mind she went beyond goofy to being an asshole why work when you did nt have to even if her bosses survived the zombie epidemic would they care if her work was nt done why did she care caryn was filling the cooler to have something to do to keep her hands and mind busy and to get away from ryan god how she hated that opinionated uneducated pessimistic son of bitch uneasily she wondered how long they be stuck in here together much longer than morning which was only few hours away and they would be on the verge of killing each other then with such shock that she almost dropped the sixpack of beer she was about to put up on shelf caryn realized that no matter what happened from now on everything she knew was irreconcilably changed even if this was puton or joke or something not real which she was too much of realist to know better than the past couple of hours had changed her if someone had walked up to her and asked how she react in an emergency like this she would have said that she be calm cool collected and efficient that how nurses acted and was nt she training to be nurse but now she knew different she had freaked out and frozen completely lost control of herself she did nt see that that did nt matter she had come through when it was needed caryn only saw that she had clutched up under pressure she unthinkingly shoved the sixpack of bud dry onto the shelf and moved over to the next pushing the single bottles of beer and wine coolers forward and filling the racks from boxes behind her still lost in thought ryan meanwhile was staring over the wall of soda crates at the dark night past the zombies still worrying the doors to the bulk of the police car and though he could nt see it his bike crushed between it and the wall of the store he had put so much work energy and money into that machine that he could nt quite believe that it was gone but intellectually he knew it was not even the handlebars could have survived that collision his treasured ultraglide was scrap metal this was not the place he wanted to be during what was apparently zombie epidemic or whatever you wanted to call it though only the front wall was glass and the windows three inches thick and pretty much unbreakable by the stupid critters it was hard to defend and if three or four had found them then there was probably more on the way they had to get out of here but how caryn jumped startled when ryan stuck his head in the cooler and said where your car parked ca nt see it out there she sighed and stretched easing her sore back do nt have one my boyfriend been driving me back and forth to work and live on campus oh that just fucking great how are we gon na get out of here ryan leaned against the cooler metal doorframe cool but not cold since she had the blowers off for at least half an hour leave but why the cops know we re here and we ve got food heat and shelter but it not safe look out front there five zombies out there now plus your cop friend when he reanimates and there bound to be more if they came here for whatever reason there gon na be more and if they break that glass we re fucked she walked down the long narrow isle toward him and ryan backed out of the cooler do nt think they can break the glass besides there back door and nothing out back but dumpsters we ve got plenty of room to run think and we re still fucked but fucked on foot those things are pretty damn stupid it looks like but do nt think it would take us long to get tired and be ambushed or something after running for couple of hours ryan said over his shoulder as he walked toward the counter caryn following after closing the cooler door and restarting the blowers without thinking about it well then you are more than welcome to leave front door or back caryn snapped annoyed at being interrupted never wanted you to stay here in the first place ryan barely heard her he was standing at the bottle crate barricade again staring past the zombies at the police car faint plume of exhaust was barely visible behind it and that gave him an idea whether she wanted to come along or not are you ready caryn took deep breath and shifted her heavy backpack slightly though it usually held her textbooks it now contained items that just might insure her and ryan survival out in zombieland no but guess ll have to be just remember if anything happens to me go straight to the police station if that been infiltrated well then good luck ryan stood posed and ready by the back door which was unlocked his hands on the long metal bar infiltrated where you learn big word like that caryn cracked nervously ryan grinned back at her at the movies cmon let do it before she was ready he hit the door bar and was out running alarms sounded as the security system was breached and caryn flinched as she followed the heavy steel door grazed her foot as it began to close behind him and she stumbled but recovered quickly and followed ryan running form around the side of the store the alarms silencing as the door shut behind them just as she caught up to him pressburg road in sight he stopped dead and she plowed into his back knocking him over and falling on top of him in sprawling tangle of arms and legs if they had nt still been on the side of the building that would have been the end of them but the zombies around front could nt see them yet you asshole he hissed in loud whisper well you he twisted around and clapped hand over her mouth holding the back of her head with the other they were laying on their sides with legs still entangled facing each other on the cold hard blacktop sssh look toward the road caryn would have bitten his hand if she could have but he had it cupped over her lips instead she did as he said craning her neck as his hands loosened and gasped but did nt scream like she wanted to in the glow of streetlight near the freeway overpass were zombies what looked like an entire shambling army coming out from beneath the bridge and heading their way from the graveyard on the other side of the freeway caryn realized they were less than half mile away and coming along slowly but steadily they could be outrun but for how long ryan slowly removed his hands from the back of her neck and mouth somehow regretting leaving the feel of her long soft silky hair her body pressed against his from chest to foot was firm yet springy in places one place in particular but he forced himself to ignore the feel of her breasts against his chest as he whispered we have got to get out of here especially now but be quiet until we re both in position do nt know if they can smell us but we re going to have to take the chance we ll go ahead with the plan you ready as ll ever be caryn whispered back squirming away from him and getting up unbalanced by her heavy backpack her body tingled from the feel of his hard and muscular unlike her boyfriend which was soft and paunchy ryan got up too absently brushing at the rippedout knees of his jeans and glanced at her caryn nodded and ran out in front of the store and across the lot reaching the parking blocks at the end before she stopped the zombies gathered around the doors had just seen her and were turning around slowly creakily she glanced around quickly saw that the road was clear to the west though eastward came the zombie army from the graveyard and called cmon you stinking things you want me come and get me dinnertime if you can catch me ryan watched from the side of the building his opinion of caryn jackson was changing fast now that she apparently recovered from the shock of the situation she was not only dealing with it but dealing with it well brave girl he thought watching from hiding as the critters turned and started for her instead of turning and running like he was sure she wanted to god knew he did caryn held her ground glancing back and forth between the two groups of shambling walking dead she was so unusual he thought terrified to the point of catatonia one minute then in charge and taking action she argue with him fiercely or just back down and get upset there was no telling what she do next and if they got out of this ryan was seriously considering asking her out the fact that she was very pretty helped this decision as his thoughts had run on the zombies had shuffled past the police car and were now passing the first set of gas pumps in loose group one of them walking into pump but this time figuring out how to get around it after moment of creaky thought they were less than fifteen feet from caryn who looked ready to vomit or bolt maybe both as the wind shifted to blow in her face it was time for ryan to make his move he braced himself then darted around the side of the building toward the police car circled it and reached for the open door but as his hand closed over the top of it another hand cold and clammy even through his white sweat socks closed around his ankle and he looked down to see the cop open mouth about to close over his calf jeans or no jeans frank had finally reanimated ryan jerked his leg away but the hand did nt let go and frank teeth clicked together with an audible snap only inches from his inteneded place lifting his other leg ryan kicked the cop directly in the face and his head snapped back nose smashing flat but his head did nt explode into pile of grey stinking mush like he thought it might the cop was lot fresher than the first zombie had been and would take lot more abuse before being felled ryan realized with shudder of terror he stomped on the cop wrist as his head snaked back to try for another bite and the hand let go ryan dancing out of his reach without thinking unfortunately he also moved out of the reach of the idling police car ryan hurry up they re getting close both ways caryn called in desperation what wrong he turned and looked at her then back at frank who was jerkily getting up on his unsteady legs your fucking cop friend is after me ca nt get into the car as ryan backed up again caryn saw frank rise up from the ground on the other side of the police car from her line of vision and totter forward like baby just learning to walk his legs shaky and rubbery as rigor mortis had nt yet set in the sight of him tore into her soul get in the other side she yelled backing up as the lead zombie from the group that had been in front of the store reached the parking blocks about six feet from her hurry it up running out of room here ryan hurried around the car and yanked open the front passenger door then crawled inside and started cursing computer terminal took up much of the room in the front seat and he had to squirm around it before he could plop into the driver seat then he looked up to see frank vacantly grinning face coming at him from the open door he erroneously assumed that frank would try to follow him around the car but he had nt and he screamed as he realized that he was trapped thinking he was dead zombie fodder and possibly soon to be one of the flesheating critters himself then frank crumpled like deflated balloon and he looked up to see caryn beyond her hands flying to her mouth and beginning to cry looking down he saw the handle of long screwdriver protuding from the back of the cop head thank god she remembered it was stuck in her belt since he forgotten about his own hurry up and get in he said they re following you she stumbled around the police car hearing the driver door slam shut and fell into the passenger seat quickly closing her door though she had to fumble to feel for the handle through tearblurred eyes shock was again taking her to its twilight region her brain overloaded by the horrors of the night she sat and cried silently tears streaming down her face and not noticing the lumpy backpack behind her as ryan wheeled the police car out of the lot leaving the zombies and the brightly lit store behind ryan floored the car down the long dark road toward the brightlylit town vaguely noticing that the sky was lightening to his right it was false dawn but it meant that daylight would come and that thought buoyed his spirits as did their escape from the store as they swept around treelined blind curve and the town sprawled before them he slammed on the brakes as hard as he could and the police car slewed sideways shuddering to stop with its alreadycrushed reinforced bumper only inches away from the two cars smashed together in the middle of the road jesus god what happened here he exclaimed his hands damp with persperation on the wheel he clutched tight enough to turn his knuckles white even through her shock caryn could get an idea of what had happened there were no bodies but in the glow of nearby streetlight the blood everywhere was quite noticeable it was splashed both inside and outside the two cars and on the ground around them one of the cars black latemodel ford escort had the driver door standing open and in the gleam of its dome light they saw single severed arm sitting on the bloody seat an indistinguishable tattoo on its wrist most likely these two cars had approached from opposite ends of the road coming around the blind curve and maybe there been zombie standing in the middle of the road or several off to the side just enough to distract the drivers so that they collided and unfortunately must have gotten out of their cars after staring for minute ryan shifted the car into reverse and backed up to nearby driveway which led into the empty parking lot of one of the many strip malls that lined the road into town he drove through the lot bypassing the accident and once back on the road beyond it floored the gas again the brakes now felt rather spongy and small red light had come on over the gas gauge but there was no time to worry about that now neither spoke as they raced down the dark silent road the police radio occasionally crackling but only static came through it then they swept around long turn and were in the town of berkley park proper and as soon as they sighted the long main street ryan slammed on the brakes again throwing caryn into the dash but barely noticing or that he bounced off the steering wheel himself it was scene out of the worst nightmare brightly lit by streetlights and their headlights zombies shambled here and there some with an obvious purpose in mind such as the one determinedly attacking the front of the 24hour laundrymat while they could hear desparite screams from inside while others simply wandered around blankly apparently having no idea what they were doing several were gathered around car in the middle of the street ahead of them and in the glare of the police car bright headlights both ryan and caryn could quite clearly see that the zombies were hanging inside the car through the open windows and chowing happily on whoever had been driving they were now zombie fodder several of the critters leaning in the windows and squabbling weakly over the priveledge of getting the freshest food ryan rolled up his window glancing over to see that the passenger side was already up caryn was staring out at the carnage with her mouth hanging open blood trickling from one nostril but obviously she did nt notice she been hurt hey wipe your nose it bleeding ryan said his voice sounding shaky even to himself you think there be anywhere safe do nt know caryn said absently swiping at her nose with her arm and grimacing as she touched the bruised member all the people are sleeping sleeping and not knowing jesus we have to go to my house and the dorm okay we can do that ryan agreed half for her peace of mind and half to get the gruesome scene before them out of his face he let up on the brake and the red light on the dash went out momentarily then reappeared glowing like mad dog eye in the darkness which way go up three streets and turn left she said squirming around to rid herself of the backpack and looking away as they passed the car surrounded by zombies in the rearview ryan saw that two of them who had nt been able to get into the group chowing down on the unlucky driver shambled away from the other car and began to follow them arms out and hands grasping at thin air as the police car sped away free of the pack caryn slouched down in her seat not caring to see any more of what the town had become ryan slowed as he approached the corner swerving to avoid little kid zombie that he saw at the last minute and made the turn tad too fast but the wellmaintained police car let him get away with it tires squealing they flew around the corner onto residential street lined with elms that stood sentenial along both sides like silent warriors who did nt care to get involved in this battle the street was still and silent mostly dark but for few scattered porch lights and lit windows here and there looks pretty quiet maybe they have nt gotten this far ryan said without thinking then realized that if the critters had gotten to her family he was giving her false hope no such luck look there caryn pointed as they passed small white house its porch light burning and in its glow they saw two zombies shambling up the driveway to disappear in the darkness on the side of the house oh shit hope they re okay god damn it this was the first time ryan had heard her swear and he glanced over at her surprised and realizing how upset and tense she was how much farther two more blocks we re about the farthest house out of town she said nervously staring out the passenger window that why had to stay in the dorm could nt walk all that way twice day back and forth to class cruising at about twentyfive they passed the dark silent houses seeing no more zombies and raising caryns hopes
