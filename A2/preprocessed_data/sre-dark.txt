sre darker half written by chris trendle edited and paul gerth compiled by robert chapman robert chapman there was an empire once deemed to be run by fool but alas the fool was no more than mastermind scheme the war torn half cybernetic ruler was so named mentor as he had proven his worth as an emperor of trust he was not however naive to the war and the stakes taking place around him after having torn down all he had built he swore vengence on all who had dishonored him his rebuild was slow and deliberate as not to attract any attention to his vastly growing armies he was at one time peaceful ruler yet the great war had changed him he knew whom he could trust and stuck with them his empire left in shambles he sought revenge building on ore mining his wealth and power grew no more would dishonorable spies palgue his empire with thoughts of undermining his work as so begins the story akaiiprime akaii castle radio transmissin from the ching dynasty sir patch them through to my office muttered mentor zbbzckkkkzxzzxxxx is all that came over the airwaves damn japanese junk shoulda got an rca damn mentor yelled as he pulled out his mkf1267 blaster zzzzzzzzzzkkkkkkkkkk the set was left in shambles scattered all along the great mapped wall screnca send message to the ching dynasty that the last radio transmission was not recieved will try to get them after the zexell moon has cleared very well sir screnca replied in an almost robotic tone now where is that catalog need new screen transmit to ching dynasty private channel what we are to discuss is of great importance mentor told the operator akaii calling the ching dynasty shang ti this is mentor have matter of importance to discuss your enemy ming will be eliminated by my forces it appears he did not know of our alliances and he gave himself away but it is of no concern anymore he will be eliminated shortly mentor called out over the airwaves with bit of relief one problem though sense the return of the one once called ensata feel his return in what is left of my organic body over the radio falls quiet for second chingprime grey highway damn japanese crap shang ti said as he leaned against his land speeder an empty beer can slammed into the side of his speeder smashing the window as someone shouted obscenities at him did you see that wusang he yelled into his communicater want you to blast them yes sir wusang replied at his companel wusang switched his sat view from the emperor to the offending speeder and with it in his crosshairs pushed button as the speeder banked off in the distance large blue line shot out of the heavens striking it there was huge explosion and the speeder crashed to the ground shang ti leapt into the air laughing that will teach you to throw beer cans at your emperor shang ti said as he turned to find his replacement speeder coming to rest near the broken one wusang stepped outt and walked over to shang ti he bowed once and waited for his emperor to speak well what the hell took so long sorry sir but we just caught another of ming spies few miles from here wusang pointed off to the distance behind shang ti good work that snake ming no wonder my sujects are throwing crap at me along the horizion came silver streak followed by cloud of dust raised by the obvoiusly oversized thrusters theoden my son the man we are about to meet is very dear friend of mine we fought side by side during the downfall of the valar and have rebuilt together team of empires which along with other alliances have once again straightened the ways of the universe mentor said to his son theoden what theoden replied pulling the sonic headphones out of his still human ears nevermind just be polite to shang ti otherwise there will be no pizza tonight mentor replied to theoden cracking half hearted smile who shang ti theoden said his interest aroused suddenly by the thought of meeting someone other than his father war friends an old friend of mine back before the time of the valar we mentor was cut off by beer can almost hitting him square in the jaw jeezsus shang ti must have been hit with spies infiltrating his empire again theoden duck another beer can barely missed his son head ve got ta talk to shang ti about all these people drinking and driving mentor exclaimed to his driver theoden was doing the typical teenage foot banging that was so popular with his type of music dad are we there yet theoden whined to his father no we are not there yet mentor said in the same drawn out whiney voice and if you ask again ll bonk beer can hit mentor right on the head damn these people realize they own the majority of the beer manufacturing plants for the galaxy but think they support their trade just leettle too much mentor muttered under his breath approaching shang ti speeder sir mentor driver said in monotonous tone aaah at last reunited with my old friend mentor said sort of pride entering his voice hand me the field scope mentor muttered to his son what his son replied once again the music that what they claim it is anyway was too loud nevermind mentor said in disgust damn kids reaching for the field glasses mentor spied something on the horizion it looked like small burning vessle grasping the glasses he set the magnification to 5x and peered through them do nt believe it somebody vandalized shang ti new mercedes he shoulda got multipersonal vette like mine oh well he ll learn one of these days looks like whoever did it got more than what they bargained for added theoden as the speeder sped closer to the burning vessel mentor prepared himself for the confrontation with shang ti at last we meet again shang ti mentor muttered to himself the speeder came screeching to halt next to shangti own speeder we have problem mentor exclaimed know the chemical weapons used agenst my empire were devestating the nukes did nt help much either ching said dropping his head that is problem and my forces have already retaliated mentor calmly said trying to calm shang ti nerves he can not last much longer now if we band together we can once again run him from this galaxy mentor held his head high though it was false show of confidence he will perish shang ti muttered under his breath barely audible to anyone else ready my cruiser mentor exclamed to his driver it is time to rick some rass mentor said playfully what are the casualties of the last five attacks on ming mentor asked of his driver frantically the driver pushed buttons on the panel zero casualties zero equipment loss sir the driver replied what shangti and mentor exclaimed in stereo let the onslought begin mentor shouted giddy with the destruction of the traitor ming theoden smelled the faint whiff of chemicals on the wind shit that stuff stank why he have to be in this hellpit anyway he did nt want to end up like his father how could he pick up chicks with stainless steel um face dad can borrow the car while you trash ensata got hot date tonight what the matter with your car that piece of trash that thing has less power than an icecream truck besides after downloaded all that pirated software into my onboard navcomp it got completely zotched by that michaelangelo thing son do nt have time for this cried mentor his electronically filtered voice rising to garbled digital screech damn cheap jap voicebox modulator oh fuck this this chick incredible ll never get back to akaiiprime in time unless can borrow your car his father turned his back on him signifying that there would be no discussion theoden took this chance to reach into his father pocket and snag the keys to the porchevette romero his father did nt notice since the nerve sensors below mentor waist were completely dead what way to live while mentor blabbed with shang theoden crept into the ruby red sports car and started the engine later pops what the get back here the car raced off picking up from to 80 in 56 nanoseconds that it you re grounded the threat was completely unheard by young theoden partly because he was at that moment trying to break the sound barrier he felt that if he went fast enough he would nt be able to see the hulk of this planet as he picked up speed all the wastelands turned into grey blur flying past the windows all the wastelands that reminded him of the fate of akaiiprime the planet he had grown up on theoden had realized something long ago he knew he hated his father even before the chemical weapons had withered his planet completely it had been wasted by the mining operations tapping every planet for any valuable ore as he grew into adolescense he had seen the green planet which held so many memories changed to wasteland all this just because of his father petty need for revenge as his planet died theoden thought his childhood had died he would nt lose all humanity he could nt allow himself to become like his robot of father but he hid his emotions deep within theoden slowed the car and realized he was crying he quickly checked this display of emotion and popped liquidizer into the dmm digital music machine mary hangs from the rearview mirror on the dash her son got words we got carload of faith here and we re saved from the world by some verse yeah for cast iron dictator you sure do nt have very good control over your kid said shang ti oh just leave me alone the kid juvenile delinquent he been thrown out of 15 boarding schools and all he does is listen to that gadawful stuff he calls music ok forget about it there something bothering me have you kept up with this asmodeus guy he just some petty dictator who took over small backwater empire maybe maybe not however we have evidence that he is in contact with ming mentor seemed unimpressed by this news have you seen the spysat coverage of his battles asked shang ti no retorted mentor obviously tiring of the conversation he master tactician not sure just how good but if he in contact with ming what demanded mentor his impatience fading well our job just got lot harder the only way we can punish ming is if we coordinate together with rohan rohan is next to asmodeus growing empire and eomer will be willing to help us we will have to organize so our attacks are simultaneous that way in the confusion we will be able to divide and conquer and we just might win this illadvised war simultaneous over all the parsecs of space we have to cover that all but impossible we need more people than we have to coordinate this whole thing shangti grinned that kid of yours no matter what you might think of him is nt such bad kid ve seen the reports from his schools know but cx1 was getting bored and had to give him something to do anyway his tests have him well above genius level he master at tactics and transspatial mathematics if anyone could pull it off think theoden could ca nt imagine that kid in charge of friggin seven11 forget combined military force mentor raved besides we do nt even know where the kid is akaiiprime deserted road exactly where theoden was was becoming mystery even to him the afterburners of the vette were cooling down from an interplanetary jump it was one of the nicer features of the more expensive sports cars small plasma drive for limited space travel the grey skies of akaiiprime no longer said home to him and he found himself in an area of the planet he did nt know or maybe he did know it at one time the mining had reshaped the planet surface and the haze of poisonous chemicals made everything look different he knew that he was lost he tried the onboard navcomp but could nt figure out the security this thing was state of the art unlike the computers he was used to breaking into like the box office computer he had cracked to get tickets to the kamikaze lemmings concert that night he had the tickets with him now if he could only figure out where he was if he could figure out where he was he could pick up kyrana at the thought of kyrana his anger settled no matter what else happened he would always have her he could picture her face those depthless brown eyes voice clear and pure as dawn after thunderstorm the spacellular phone chirped uh oh it dad better not answer he thought the phone would nt stop ringing however finally the speakerphone clicked on and started speaking in familiar voice theoden started only two people knew how to do that theoden himself and farstal you old knave how you get this number chingprime cx headquarters hrrrrrissssxxxxxxx damn jap piece of shhhhhxxxxxxxxx akaiiprime secret bunker oh no not again shang ti slammed the top of the set beeeeep work damn you he hit the set repeatedly few seconds later the set winked to life again hello charlie xray one come in cx1 do you read me who the hell is this this is closed channel dammit this is your emperor uhhh sorry boss what this about you want me to plant bomb no take hostage no set up asmodeus and ming no liste oh boy do you want me to assasinate someone no shaddup want you to find someone cx1 someone been kidnapped no ohmygod was it mentor you were meeting him were nt you for spy you sure got big mouth cx1 need you to find kid akaiiprime akaii castle mentor opened his eyes ooooaahhhhaaa he slamed them shut again ohhh he thought that hurt when will learn not to mix tiegillian gin with that earth beer jeeze just then the room exploded or at least he thought so as shang ti pounded on the door open up exclaimed shang ti yo akaii mentor akaii get your ass outta bed we found your kid let me in mentor pressed the door realese button the door opened with click and shang ti pushed through the door goddamn it he said as the women scurried into the bathroom couldnt this wait til morning we also have small problem again shang ti siad halfheartedly now what mentor muttered trying to hide the tee pee made from the sheets of the oversized bed well there were some nukes headed your way they hit in the kilarian sector my instruments picked them up we tried to intercept them but were not quick enough shang ti explained dammit it must be that ming yoyo again mentor exclaimed they were launched by asmodeus what how did that second class dictator get nukes and why the bastard attack me we had ceasefire agreement that it let us go prepare for war mentor said vehemently as he put on his lazer armored trousers ca nt hurt the jewels in these mentor quipped cracking smile have heard theoden plan for the invasion it sounds like it should work but need time to rebuild my forces shang ti claimed ok mentor said just after mentor let out the words lazer blast burst through the far window glancing off mirror and hitting him square in the head mentor shang ti cried what theoden voice became sketchy my father was killed by whom his native red eyes glowed ever so fiercely we do nt know laser blast came through the window your security forces are searching for the asassin and my soldiers are joining them said shang ti what are the chances of finding him if we have nt found him by now doubt we will replied shang ti in soft tone theoden sank back into the chair know nothing about running peaceful empire he thought all know is music and hacking and mathematical tactics have no practical experience ruling my father was too busy seeking revenge to teach me diplomacy or leadership he just shipped me off to boarding schools to get me out of his way theoden could only assume it was one of asmodeus agents who had killed his father who had left him to rule an empire he knew nothing about he now understood his father pain and he now felt his father rage revenge will be mine he muttered theoden pored over the spreadsheets damn he had no idea how this stuff worked his field was spatial geometry and tactics the mathematics were completely different from those involved in accounting matters of money were more closely related to the mathematics farstal had studied farstal would have been able to help him would have he tried not to think back to the events of that night but it was inevitable he felt flashback coming on flashback farstal and theoden had been friends since earliest youth they met in elementary computer literacy both of them were bored to tears and spent their time writing viruses and setting them free on the school mainframe most of the viruses were harmless and did little more than garble text files and slow the computers down they had one the computer cold that would make the computers cough every once in while the computers would reboot much to the dismay of students in the middle of writing their term papers later on they started breaking into secure systems and became very familiar with the phone system together they had discovered how to remotely access phones certain high tech phones had voice controlled answer feature if no one answered they could send pulse signal and the phone would connect through speaker it only worked on phones with the answer feature higher tech phones the phone in mentor car was of course state of the art akaii prime decimated city theoden ya snagged the old man car how you kno oh never mind should nt be surprised by anything you do where are you man honestly do nt know the security on this navcomp is the best available heh no security unbreakable there always hole oh yeah you try said theoden patching the phone over to the navcomp he watched in amazement as farstal broke through the security in nothing flat hah think that new record you are simply incredible know hey you re not too far from where you need to be the landscape just is nt familiar because it been rearranged by an attack force ming no there some new fascist dictator who took over small empire nobody knows who he is he known only as asmodeus ve been rummaging through asmodeus data files ca nt quite figure out who he is but think have pretty good idea he started out attacking smaller empires gethering strength but lately he been attacking the larger empires and having unbelievably phenomenal success he brilliant tactician in the classic powellian stratagems he must be patched into the fleet by some sort of cyberlink their performance is absolutely flawless like clockwork whaddaya think huh theoden had been lost in thought powellian strategy had been an interest of his for as long as he could remember it was almost impossible to execute as it required exact precision but it was believed that there was no counter to it always interested in challenge theoden had spent all his free time trying to figure out way not only to defend against powellian offensives but to turn them back it was such daring ploy that it made blitzkrieg look like throwing pinecones at passing cars listen think can handle this guy pretty sure ve figured out counter to hold it farstal voice was so severe that theoden blood ran momentarily cold what asked theoden trying to keep the fear from entering his voice just heard something it was probably nothing theoden could tell from farstal tone that it definately was something his suspicions were confirmed by farstal next remark oh did you know my cat anthrax had six kittens anthrax six those were the code words meaning that the line was being tapped but why by whom theoden probed for more information ok hey do you think can get one of the kittens no was thinking of sending them to asmodeus what shit this was serious he had scanned the tap and it was nt by friend rather they were being listened to by an agent of asmodeus what else the cats are right here with me that could only mean that farstal had managed to infiltrate asmodeus coordinating computer well hope your dog does nt see them he already has and he been watching them now this was serious there had been an agent dispatched by asmodeus to find him now what kind of dog do you have again theoden asked his voice trembling pit bull think the kittens are in trouble pit bull an asassin may also send some to shang ti an agent from ching was also after him shang ti has very good watchdog do nt think they be in danger with him an agent to spy on him maybe to protect him any female kittens yeah the pit bull seems to be leaving her alone for the moment but she might be in danger there are more than one what the hey who the hell are you whoah put that down man zzzzzt aaaaagh farstal farstal theoden mind raced it was all too much for him to take in at once while trying to keep his head from spinning he was confused by another occurrence pair of lights lanced through the air headlights his stomach dipped down into his crotch it was one of the spies he knew that there was one spy from shang ti sent either to keep an eye on him protect him or perhaps to kidnap him then there was an asassin sent by asmodeus after him perhaps more than one and maybe one of them was after kyrana he had found that much out from farstal before before his heart raced and his adrenal gland went into overdrive it was nearly impossible to think but he realized that he was too easily recognizable in his father million dollar sportscar he fumbled for the door handle his ears buzzing then he was out in the cold foul smelling night air the headlights were no longer illuminating the scene and clouds of smog covered the fingernail moon he ran completely disoriented hoping only to get away from whomever was in that car light briefly flashed behind him illuminating the scene slightly then needle of red light lanced by his left ear so close he could feel the heat against the skin of his cheek he jumped aside throwing himself to the ground and the ruins of the city were shown bright as day by the exploding porchevette romero then he ran ran past walls of ruined brick buildings down cracked asphalt road seeing his way by the light of the flaming automobile his lungs burned his legs ached but he did nt slow the pain in his chest was overpowered by the exhiliration of his fear the landscape brightened he looked over his shoulder and was blinded by the headlights of the car he dashed to the side of the road ducking behind the facade that was all that remained of bank he felt his breathing stopped by hand clamping over his mouth he tried to scream and kicked out but the arms grasped tighter no it could nt end this way he had to warn kyrana shut up kid we do nt want him to hear us shang ti wants you alive the leather gloved hand eased its grip on his mouth and he gasped for air what does shang ti want with me theoden asked between gasps with slight dismay in his voice he needs the details of your counterstrike the dark figure said the car passed by its infrared scanner working overtime trying to lock in on the heat source it had found we must move quickly the spy said hasitly moving with unheard of stealth the spy and theoden traveled through the back alleyways until they came to an open manhole not going down there theoden said with glare in his eye just then the all too familar face of shang ti appeared quit your bitchin and get your little ass down here now he excalimed looking around hastily shang ti insisted on bringing theoden back so the attack could begin asap when he objected on the matter of kyrana safety shang ti sent cx1 to protect her sent his best agent this had to be serious the dank sewer system led to small room filled with nothing but computer terminals pretty sure your dad does nt know about this place this is our base for covert operations on this planet there an armored vehicle directly above us it will take you home to your father castle first though need to know your plan plan asmodeus was nt the only one monitoring that call sorry about your friend he sounded like someone could use someone we all could use asmodeus has tipped his hand he wants complete control everything he must be stopped theoden explained his plan to shang ti and was sent on his way he was secretly dreading having to tell his father about the car suddenly an alarm klaxon sounded in the armored vehicle there someone behind us the driver shouted the monitor showed darkly colored car closing on the slower armored groundcar theoden recognized it as the vehicle that had chased him at the ruined city we ca nt outrun it arm weapons systems how had the spy followed them the only possible explanation was that it had gotten an ir lock on them before they had entered the sewers driver calling shang ti we have some company here he probably knows where the base of operations is advise you abandon repeat advise you abandon static then read you this is shang ti squad of ching troops just arrived here do nt think it will be necessary to abandon however ll be taking an armored speeder to akaii castle meet me there roger just then the vehicle was rocked by an explosion shit take that you bastard the groundcar weapon systems unleashed volley of fire the car was reduced to pile of scrap metal even if he got out in time he ca nt follow us now said the driver grimly the groundcar arrived at mentor castle but theoden soon found out that he would nt have to explain the vette to his father his father had been asassinated akaii prime akaii castle theoden was sick with trying to balance the books so he went over again in his head the plan of attack since asmodeus was most likely hooked up to his forces by cyberlink the same would be necessary for him if he were to achieve victory he smiled grimly all those thousands of ships and it all boiled down to little more than contest between two minds like some bizarre game of high stakes high speed chess he rubbed the back of his head which was still sore from the operation to install the interface chip into his brain the one drawback to his strategy was that it had to be defensive any attack on powellian spearhead would be routed immediately no matter how carefully or cleverly done he had to wait for another attack which he knew would be big one huge strike by asmodeus newly acquired empire against the forces of all the major galactic empires the waiting was driving him insane besides he could nt handle all this number crunching he was tactitian not mathematician dammit he plugged into the simulator and ran classic powellian attack his reactions were perfect but he failed because his mind was elsewhere pondering the fact that the next time could be the real thing he could nt retain his sanity much longer this way theoden could wait no longer suddenly he was hit by inspiration there was one way he could launch successful attack against powellian spearhead it was even riskier than his previous strategy but it could work if patch me through to cyberlink mianframe theoden called through the com patching sire plugged in and waiting your command the system operator called back are the troops in position theoden called again through the com set and online the voice returned ok here what we re gon na do when we begin the invasion want all channels scanned known and unknown when we find out what frequency he is using want you to broadcast some beastie boys over the channel that oughta confuse the hell out of his outdated cyberlink it ll allow us an advantage for approximately 1520 seconds want all waves to be on time now so be sure everyone is set has the food been destroyed yet theoden cleared his mind of everything but the attack yes sire there is great unrest among asmodeus troops and civilians the voice replied good now position the fighters to the alpha detron position as soon as they are picked up on his radar begin to scan he will immediately mobilize and when he does blast the music smile spread across theoden face before he checked this display of emotion deep space rohanasmodeus border the fighters have been picked up scanning locked jamming you got ta fight no so whatcha for your right sleep whatcha to paaaarty til brooklyn whatcha want theoden watched the monitor and quickly positioned his fighters in behind asmodeus troops and heavy crusers the 15 seconds was over and the onslaught began some fighters were lost due to careless crossfire but the battle was won asmodeus was captured and brought to castle akaii there he would face theoden and shang ti to recieve his sentence he knew deep within his heart that neither would have any mercy on him he knew that there he would die cold and alone the next day came and rejoicing echoed throughout the empires holding asmodeus head high for all to see were shang ti and the new young emperor theoden asmodeus was dead but the war agenst evil was not ended for there was one missing among the dead and somewhere out there lied an ancient advesary ming deep space cloaked ship hmmmm fools all fools the dark figure moved in his chair as he hissed at the vidcon screen that showed shang ti holding the head of his best agent asmodeus laughed aloud will soon have my revenge as he turned off the vidcon the door opened and ming walked in so asmodeus you did make it out alive ming hissed yesss but those fools will pay pay for my pain roared asmodeus as he turned exposing his charred face and cybereye ming withdrew step in horror and added yes they will pay
