the ugly duckling once upon time down on an old farm lived duck family and mother duck had been sitting on clutch of new eggs one nice morning the eggs hatched and out popped six chirpy ducklings but one egg was bigger than the rest and it did nt hatch mother duck could nt recall laying that seventh egg how did it get there tock tock the little prisoner was pecking inside his shell did count the eggs wrongly mother duck wondered but before she had time to think about it the last egg finally hatched strange looking duckling with grey feathers that should have been yellow gazed at worried mother the ducklings grew quickly but mother duck had secret worry ca nt understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine she said to herself shaking her head as she looked at her lastborn well the grey duckling certainly was nt pretty and since he ate far more than his brothers he was outgrowing them as the days went by the poor ugly duckling became more and more unhappy his brothers did nt want to play with him he was so clumsy and all the farmyard folks simply laughed at him he felt sad and lonely while mother duck did her best to console him poor little ugly duckling she would say why are you so different from the others and the ug duckling felt worse than ever he secretly wept at night he felt nobody wanted him nobody loves me they all tease me why am different from my brothers then one day at sunrise he ran away from the farmyard he stopped at pond and began to question all the other birds do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine but everyone shook their heads in scorn we do nt know anyone as ugly as you the ugly duckling did not lose heart however and kept on making enquiries he went to another pond where palr of large geese gave him the same answer to his question what more they warned him do nt stay here go away it dangerous there are men with guns around here the duckling was sorry he had ever left the farmyard then one day his travels took him near an old countrywoman cottage thinking he was stray goose she caught him ll put this in hutch hope it female and lays plenty of eggs said the old woman whose eyesight was poor but the ugly duckling laid not single egg the hen kept frightening him just wait if you do nt lay eggs the old woman will wring your neck and pop you into the pot and the cat chipped in hee hee hope the woman cooks you then can gnaw at your bones the poor ugly duckling was so scared that he lost his appetite though the old woman kept stuffing him with food and grumbllng if you wo nt lay eggs at least hurry up and get plump oh dear me moaned the now terrified duckling ll die of fright first and did so hope someone would love me then one night finding the hutch door ajar he escaped once again he was all alone he fled as far away as he could and at dawn he found himself in thick bed of reeds if nobody wants me ll hid here forever there was plenty food and the duckling began to feel little happier though he was lonely one day at sunrise he saw flighth of beatiful birds wing overhead white with long slender necks yellow beaks and large wings they were migrating south if only could look like them just for day said the duckling admiringly winter came and the water in the reed bed froze the poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow he dropped exhausted to the ground but farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket ll take him home to my children they ll look after him poor thing he frozen the duckling was showered with kindly care at the farmer house in this way the ugly duckling was able to survive the bitterly cold winter however by springtime he had grown so big that the farmer decided ll set him free by the pond that was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in tne water goodness how ve changed hardly recognize myself the flight of swans winged north again and glided on to the pond when the duckling saw them he realized he was one of their kind and soon made friends we re swans like you they said warmly where have you been hiding it long story replied the young swan still astounded now he swam majestically with his fellow swans one day he heard children on the river bank exclaim look at that young swan he the finest of them all and he almost burst with happiness
