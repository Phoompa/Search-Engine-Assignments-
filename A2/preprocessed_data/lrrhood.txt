at the garden gate saying grandma is ill take her this basket of cakes but be very careful keep to the path through the wood and do nt ever stop that way you will come to no harm little red riding hood kissed her mother and ran off do nt worry she said ll run all the way to grandma without stopping full of good intentions the little girl made her way through the wood but she was soon to forget

another one and one more this is the last well this one mmmm the red fruit peeped invitingly through the leaves in the grassy glade and little red riding hood ran back and forth popping strawberries into her mouth suddenly she remembered her mother her promise grandma and the basket and hurried back towards the path the basket was still in the grass and humming to herself little red riding hood walked on the wood became thicker and thicker suddenly yellow butterfly fluttered down through the trees little red riding hood started to chase the butterfly ll catch you ll catch you she called suddenly she saw some large daisies in the grass oh how sweet she exclaimed and thinking of grandma she picked large bunch of flowers in the meantime two wicked eyes were spying on her from behind tree strange rustling in the woods made little red riding hood heart thump now quite afraid she said to herself must find the path and run away from here at last she reached the path again but her heart leapt into her mouth at the sound of gruff voice which said where are you going my pretty girl all alone in the woods taking grandma some cakes she lives at the end of the path said little riding hood in faint voice when he heard this the wolf for it was the big bad wolf himself politely asked does grandma live by herself oh yes replied little red riding hood and she never opens the
