the longest distance 1992 boynton the night maggie whitehurst hanged herself was sixty miles away fishing with her husband well her estranged husband as they say on the television news spent lot of time cleaning in the months following the final divorce decree cleaned the house mean all of the house scrubbing the little brown stains out of the corners of the bathroom scrubbed the floors of the kitchen and the utility room on my hands and knees with brush then waxed the floors to brilliant shine anyone who watches daytime television commercials would have been proud of could see myself shampooed the carpets bought new curtains for the bedroom and new bedspread had dent bumped out of an old mustang had picked up cheap in the auto trader and then had the whole car painted metallic red always wanted red car and always wanted mustang scrubbed as much of the corrosion as could from the brightwork of my little boat replaced the refrigerator in the kitchen and painted the trim on the duplex shared with my friend wesley chin not sure exactly what caused my sudden interest in cleanliness other than some freudian reaction to one of my father favorite sayings about getting one house in order also ended up cleaning out my desk at the television station where worked that was nt my choice though it was theirs after management decided they did nt like my face much anymore either sagging ratings at six and eleven brought in consultant from iowa who hooked up pack of viewers to machine that measures galvanic skin response in short my picture on the screen did nt make their palms sweaty enough they brought in the latest blowdried model from dubuque to replace me at about half the cost they were however perfectly willing to pay me for the eighteen months remaining on my contract provided of course did not seek employment at one of the two other network affiliates in town had no desire to do so at thirty seven years of age and after fifteen years in the business was just about televisioned out my friend wesley told me was very lucky man he was referring to two things first thanks to the contract payout was not in any immediate need of work and could in fact live very comfortably for the next year or so doing absolutely nothing or as he put it less than nothing doing nothing he said implies that you are unemployed and have no desire to seek employment would suggest that you really work at doing nothing you have gone through the hit parade of stressful situations in the past few months he counted them off on his fingers one you have gone through separation and divorce two you have lost your job three you ve moved to new home and four you have substantially changed your lifestyle you need therapy brad little shortterm stress reduction would nt hurt of course being the manly superhero you are that is unthinkable suggesting you really revel in the nothingness of the things you do get plenty of sleep drink plenty of liquor if that what you want to do and generally clean out your head as well as you ve cleaned up the apartment jesus if you really want to clean come on down to my place he also said there were much worse places to be single and thirtyseven than virginia beach virginia in the summertime wesley was referring of course to the large number of tourists who populate the beaches in the summertime many have it on good authority about half of these tourists are women who seek the sun and sand the city tourism bureau is fond of publicizing in its brochures have lived in virginia beach an even dozen years and have never seen any of the places where all of these beautiful pictures are taken firmly believe the photos are taken somewhere else hawaii for instance then plugged into the virginia beach literature the brochures show blue blue cloudless skies with romantic couples silhouetted toasting each other with wine looking out over white beach with multicolored umbrellas in reality the weather comes pounding out of the mountains then comes to screeching halt when it hits the confluence of the chesapeake bay and the ocean leaving the sky an interesting shade of orange at times when was reporter used to do stories this time of year about elderly people who didnt have or could nt afford to run their air conditioning this time of year was tougher than the cold days of winter air conditioning for them is just as much necessity as furnace in the winter nothing moves then the winds die and the air fills up with the gunk and smutch of industry and autos the temperature goes up and up into the mid nineties along with the humidity the beach is nt even real most of the sand is trucked in from well inland since the spring storms wash away most of what there every year right up to the boardwalk seawall and god forbid any of the city police officers catch you with wine glass anywhere near the beach virginia beach is not hawaii it not florida either if only because its season is different it is mostly summertime resort mostly for middleincome and working class people from new york pennsylvania and for some reason can not fathom canada the signs welcoming you to the city world largest resort city are in both english and french and many of the hotels fly both united states and canadian flags out front in respect for our neighbors to the north and their strange colored currency but it is home and has been for the past ten years wesley says the normal reaction of many men in my position would be to take my little red mustang down to the beach find myself one or more young women around the age of twenty and have myself one hell of summer frankly the thought of doing that would scare me to death for one what would you talk about afterward the latest guns and roses album the latest hits on mtv the prospect did nothing for me had however gone surf fishing once or twice along the tourist strip and had noticed that large proportion of the women were single and appeared to be between the ages of say thirty and forty well within the range of my consideration my shrink says that progress yes have shrink too and wesley says that progress my wife well now exwife barbara had decided our life together was not moving forward quickly enough to suit her whatever the hell that means she wanted more of commitment marriage is commitment told her when the time came for barbara and to settle up the inventory we had acquired in twelve years of marriage guilt played heavily in my decision to be the one who moved out leaving goodsized home the good car and much of the furniture in her name retained the interest in rental property had invested in with wesley my old car and the boat wesley already lived in the lower floor of the duplex when the tenant upstairs moved out moved in on temporary basis and paid our little partnership rent at the going rate sixmonth lease and all wesley chin got in on the ground floor of the computer revolution he year older than am but looks ten younger early in his career his expertise led to pair of college texts one simple introduction to computers for most any computer science 101 class the other highly technical graduate level text on networking computers linking several machines or several hundred or several thousand together it how for example kmart world headquarters in troy michigan can tell when package of chewing gum is sold at the store in boca raton florida although he keeps telling me he overdue to crank out third textbook alternate reality is the hot new area he says he makes good living by keeping the other two current second edition and third edition updating the technoworld of computers do well in killing the used book market for college students and they keep the cash register ringing money flowing into wesley bank account the mexican restaurant he bought from the royalties also helps it called chin tijuana palace and to my knowledge it the only mexican restaurant that serves fortune cookies with the check it on the tourist strip atlantic avenue which runs right along the line of big hotels on the oceanfront the tourists like gimmicks and it something they remember to tell their friends when they head back to montreal albany or harrisburg it had been one of those hazy humid close kind of saturdays in late july at chesapeake beach not much wind to speak of if at all being outside on days like this makes me feel as if need hot rocks and branches to beat myself with compared to some parts of virginia beach chesapeake beach is lowrent the big cedar jobs on stilts line the ocean beaches four five six bedroom homes that cost several hundred thousand dollars only get used in the summertime and cost bundle to insure because of the hurricane threat every year chesapeake beach faces the bay instead the residents mostly live here yearround in everything from cinderblock huts to homes of little but not much more substance the houses here are older shorter squatted between the dunes and scrub out of necessity taking the full brunt of spring northeast winds the tourist strip and the tourists are right around the corner but they re mostly out of sight and mercifully do nt wander much to our stretch of sand wesley and had been doing some work on the upper deck that sits atop the duplex we share facing the bay ours was not on stilts sitting far enough from the shore that we had wide beach and few spring flooding problems we became partners in the house couple of years back introduced by real estate agent who puts together such deals for rental properties it was sweaty work section of the deck near the wall was beginning to rot even the green salttreated lumber has trouble holding up to the heat and humidity along the water owning waterfront house here means constant maintenance inside the big kenwood was locked in to wnsb herbie mann was driving the big ev speakers with just enough power to go cruising by flute we were both covered with sawdust kicked up by the table saw downstairs we were working up an appetite and had been discussing the merits of bushel of clams and bucket of icecold stroh few of the other people from up the beach had wandered by offering carpentry tips in exchange for cold beer as the work wound down bill and ramona baker had fetched the clams pete and sharon crosby had rolled up with more beer tom scott showed and we wound up sitting on the deck clams on the weber kettle watching the dirty pink sunset the party if you want to call it that turned into one of those events where people drift in and out catching up on the latest neighborhood gossip bitching about what the city council is up to now coveting their neighbors spouses and discussing in no particular order the middle east the american league east the city poor excuse for garbage collection and traffic on the expressway suppose we topped out at about fifteen or twenty people although there were never more than eight or nine around at time around eleven the married couples had tottered off to their kids and to sleep in preparation for early teetimes and early church services in the morning only the three bachelors were left wesley tom and me staring out at the boats that bobbed out around the islands of the chesapeake bay bridgetunnel that seventeenmile span that crosses over and under the mouth of the bay breeze had come up blowing the pollution into someone else air you could smell it rain was maybe eight hours away wesley is short compact and muscular sort of like fire plug with black hair and glasses tom is tall and lanky with red hair and an everpresent sunburn aside from the fact that he very liberal attorney an officer in the virginia chapter of the american civil liberties union he could be the kind of good ole boy with full rifle rack in his ford pickup his neck is that red his rifle rack however is full of fishing rods with tackle box in the capped bed must be good fishing tonight wesley commented looking out at the boats around the bridge islands the bluefish are running tom said they sure would taste good for sunday dinner wesley said they both looked at me you guys want to go fishing take the boat can take hint pulled the keys out of my pocket and tossed them to tom aw come on brad wesley said come with us blow some stink off you are incredibly confused my confusing friend fishing does not blow stink off wesley fishing puts stink on am not interested tonight if you two want to go take off wesley glanced at tom and smiled is robin working at the marina tonight think so fuck you both said let go tom grinned and got his gear and jacket from the truck wesley locked up the marina and its adjacent pier is about threehundred yards down the beach at lynnhaven inlet it was not planned the way it looks it just sort of grew the way it did the old plank pier goes back to the forties and sticks some twohundred feet into the bay adjacent to the inlet at the foot of the pier stands the bait shop and office built sometime in the fifties the sixties brought the first of the docks and small butler building as service facility the seventies however saw the marina business mushroom newer concrete piers with big timbers and galvanized bolts holding it all together modern brick andvinylsided building for lockers shower facilities and fish market that will clean what you catch or sell you what you did nt the next step was to be restaurant and small motel that no doubt would grow on into the next century you could nt build it from scratch the way it had grown unless you had quite vision and lot of money we walked by the time we got there it was about eleven thirty and the complex bubba lynnhaven fishing center was busy with wide variety of fisherfolks the wealthy in their designer clothes with little animals on the pockets taking the bertram for latenight spin whole families of the poor mom and dad and the kids both black and white hoping to catch sunday crab dinner from the pier using chicken necks tied to string and the three of us somewhere in the middle lined up to buy bait robin was indeed working robin williams swear is big tall lady who manages the place for ed shaw known to his friends as you guessed it bubba she has very short black hair and strong features this particular evening she was barelegged wearing red shorts an old dominion university sweatshirt and surprisingly clean white reeboks her features are angular enough to look little masculine although there is nothing at all masculine about the legs or the way she filled the sweatshirt she is very tan with scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose darker tan than mine and had been working at it pretty good it made her cool blue eyes look very vivid and her teeth look very white you would not confuse her with the comedian despite the name thirty maybe give or take five to seven either way hard to guess her age because her face had that sharplychiseled look that does nt show much decay between eighteen and forty or so met robin when first got the boat about the same time as the duplex it was 1947 twenty four foot chriscraft cruiser purchased from family up on the eastern shore it was not in good shape the family had used it as crab boat with the help of the mechanics at the marina we had swapped the old mill out with new ford fourcylinder scrubbed most of the pea green paint off the mahogany updated the instrument cluster with digital units and repaired or replaced most of the brightwork with original pieces they had helped me track down robin wrote the receipts for the checks had stroked to fill this hole in the water she also helped me christen the little tub the talking head television term for the tight shots of faces you see most often on news broadcasts robin thought it an amusing name since head is the nautical term for toilet the boat still needed lot of work but then so did two years ago when first met her robin also sported yellow wedding band on her left hand that adornment had recently turned up missing was curious and frankly interested brad brad streeter knew without looking that the voice that came across the crowded shop was bobby whitehurst had not seen him in some time turned to greet him wondering what kind of reception was going to get not exactly knowing if was going to be greeted warmly or slugged in the face he was smiling was relieved bobby good to see you it was not particularly good to see him so lied you coming or going hoped he was coming and going home to his wife going you know the blues are running he jerked thumb out toward the bay yeah heard motioned at wesley and tom across the shop bobby whitehurst think you ve met wesley this is tom scott bobby shook hands with tom nodded recognition then shook hands with wesley bobby lived next door when lived with barbara said to no one in particular we ve met each other once or twice around the courthouse tom said with grin more than that bobby said this old boy took one of my clients for bunch of money now bobby tom said he should nt have locked them out of their house it was his house and they had nt paid the rent you guys gon na try this one again here or are we gon na fish wesley said with smile bobby looked at tom holding his fishing pole and tackle box you guys going out sure tom said want to come along the beer is cold sure beats cleaning out my boat by myself afterward so the four of us piled into my boat and cruised out the inlet headed for open water once we were anchored near the bridge wesley and tom sat on the bow casting out into the pilings nearest the island bobby and sat at the stern casting the other direction bobby is goodlooking fellow with closecropped blond hair tall loud and gregarious the whitehursts were virginia born for generations back from that hardy earnest hungry stock which had scared the living hell out of the federal troops they had faced during the war between the states he was year or two younger than me his eyes pale watery blue blonde hair thinning little guess you say he had little bit of baby face since known him he tried beard once or twice but always shaved it off because he said it made him look like leftover from the sixties bobby and maggie barbara and me the four of us were pretty much inseparable when we lived next door to each other vacations together holidays together saturday night dinners together there an interesting phenomenon about married couples when one marriage goes down the hatch the strain is usually too much on the couples friends they ve developed had nt seen bobby since moved out of the house how maggie an embarrassed smile she moved out about six weeks ago went to stay with her folks in north carolina for while that the other thing about separation and divorce its contagious temporary or permanent do nt know bobby sat down in heap on the seat at the stern said she needed some time to get some things straight and put some things behind her offered to take some time off to go on cruise or vacation somewhere maybe trip across the country she said no had some things to take care of at home with her dad said she wanted to get rid of some demons his voice trailed off he looked me in the eye for the first time since we met at the bait shop think she going to file for divorce and she just wants me to get used to the idea ca nt exactly say it was shock maggie and bobby had their share of problems even back in the days when the four of us were running around together bobby has never had what you would call booming law practice although he is an above average attorney when it comes to civil matters his has always been oneman office with parttime secretary to answer the phone when he off to court or looking up old deeds or doing all those things attorneys do when he was between secretaries maggie helped out that how they met but mostly she stayed home bobby had turned down several offers to join other firms both big and small always saying he rather be his own boss the fact that bobby always seemed to be struggling was the source of much friction between maggie and bobby over the years maggie would see people her age at the sort of parties lawyers and their wives attend and wonder why she and bobby did nt have home on the beach mercedes in the driveway and condo on the ski slopes at masanutten or wherever in short maggie thought bobby did nt try hard enough didnt apply himself enough as she used to say but they had always hung in there apparently until recently he spat over the side downwind with excellent accuracy and velocity ca nt stand moping around like this bobby said and turned to holler at wesley and tom on the bow hey guys you getting any nibbles brad tell them about the time the four of us and so it went for the next couple of hours the time we hiked all over washington sightseeing in the sweltering summer heat the time we went to the outer banks of north carolina rented cottage on the ocean got drunk and staged west side story on the beach in the moonlight ending up in the surf singing when you re jet you re jet all the way we tried the windward side of the island we tried the leeward side of the island we went out to deeper water we headed north nearly to the eastern shore and tried the shallows the crabs chewed up the bait over and over again by five we had just about given up the east sky was getting brighter and we headed south back to bubba throttled down through the no wake zone at the mouth of the inlet just as the sun began to come up over the horizon and idled down into the slip robin was waiting for us at the top of the dock arms crossed she was not smiling white virginia beach police car was parked on the gravel near the dock as soon as tom tied up robin called to bobby bobby she called out these officers are here to see you the four of us looked at each other bobby shrugged and said maybe being served with papers for one of my cases it happens sometimes the officers were mutt and jeff team the uniformed one was tall and skinny darkhaired fellow with perfectly tailored uniform the plainclothes officer or detective or whatever was blond short and stout jeff spoke to bobby mister whitehurst that me bobby said we need to speak with you for moment he said to robin may we use your office of course she said we went to the bait shop bobby into the office with jeff looking confused mutt stood near the patrol car drinking coffee robin shot me look that said something was very wrong we could hear the detective speaking to bobby but could not make out what he was saying he was speaking in very low very soothing tones there was no mistaking however the anguish in bobby voice when he shouted oh no then we heard bobby talking very low his voice barely audible over the hum of the fluorescent tubes it was quiet for another moment all four of us were bugeyed staring at the office door when bobby stepped out the door and said very quietly maggie is dead they say she killed herself last night out at her father place then he began crying big racking sobs the kind that do nt let you catch your breath he walked outside sat down on the step and kept on crying the four of us looked at each other thank god robin was the only one of us who had any idea of what to do she sat down on the step next to bobby put her arms around him in big hug and the two of them rocked back and forth she stroked his hair and whispered something into his ear over and over my mind was somewhere else guess actually my mind was in several locations at once there was another reason was nt surprised maggie had left bobby she had fallen out of love with bobby several years before knew this because she had told me so in the bed we had shared for very brief period following my separation from barbara for while believed she would leave him would leave barbara and we would get together my shrink maintains that men are rarely ready to throw marriage into the dumper until they have found new person to begin relationship with thought about this lot because somehow had it in my mind that after the papers were signed and my marriage to barbara finally consigned to my past could begin over again with maggie whitehurst that she would leave bobby and we would have something played and replayed lot of scenes in my head concerning myself and maggie wondered often how things might have been different or better or at least feel better wondered if would ever see her again wondered if should call her sometimes wondered what would have happened to my marriage if had spent the same amount of energy on my relationship with barbara that spent on fantasizing about the past and possible future with maggie wondered if it made any difference at all the relationship with maggie began about two months after barbara and split and ended just before the final decree was signed maggie decided she could not take the stress of carrying on with her best friend husband although their relationship was not what it had been when was living with barbara do nt know how it could have been the whole thing was nt doing much for my mental health either as they say it all water under the bridge now there are lot of bridges in virginia beach and one whole ocean full of water ii the outer banks of north carolina is one of the more beautiful places on the continent getting there from virginia along route 168 is not exactly picturesque it is one of the most boring 90 minute trips through truck farms tobacco fields small towns and sevenelevens on the face of the planet the fields are only broken by an occasional ramshackle house or mobile home each with its own satellite dish out back all of sudden when youre thinking you will drive smack into telephone pole just for little excitement the road takes big turn to the left and you get breathtaking view of pamlico sound and the bridge that crosses it into the outer banks when the wright brothers travelled this way from dayton to turn bicycles into flying machines the outer banks wasnt much different than the rest of the area it simply faced the atlantic ocean instead of creek or the pamlico sound it mostly scrub pine and dunes all feeling quite justifiably like good wind could blow it all away rather quickly there is substantially more to blow away now than there was then those same cottages that line the ocean beach in virginia beach also form queue along the shoreline here so do small cinderblock motels and tall namebrand hotels small momandpop grocery stores and big stateoftheart strip shopping centers that wind is also the fear many of the people who live here have and why the threat of hurricane sends many of them miles inland when one approaches almost annually of course it was the wind that brought the brothers to north carolina in the first place it usually gentle but constant on this day it was neither each new detonation blew the dingy clouds at good clip out over the ocean it was unusually chilly with the threat of another downpour at any moment it was tuesday and had been raining off and on since midday sunday the signs along the highway warned of stretches with water over the roadway the pamlico sound stretches all the way back up to virginia straight shot by water or up the banks by land but either route is blocked by the back bay national wildlife refuge and state park you can go into but not through that area back into virginia unless you have permit those permits are jealously guarded by the virginia department of game and inland fisheries and the us department of interior the officers of both agencies patrol the dirt roads through their domains if you ve got permit it cuts the trip by more than half the rest of us endure the haul through the country where among the locals the word shit grows to six syllables maggie funeral was scheduled for small chapel at the south end of kill devil hills as far south on the outer banks as one can go without heading for hatteras with the rain still falling every now and then my progress down the highway was not delayed considerably by the tourists who flock to this area this time of year was early they were holed up in the stilted cottages playing gin rummy waiting out the weather in the winter the areas population can almost be counted on both hands and feet on sunny summer day there gridlock on the pair of twolane highways that span the northsouth length of the banks had already made arrangements at nearby hotel for an overnight stay after the service like most of the newer permanentlooking structures in the area the morehouse funeral chapel was brick and vinyl sided building red brick below white siding perhaps because of the progress had made on highway was one of the first to arrive parked the ford in the scrabbly oystershell lot and walked into the building the funeral director guessed he was the owner of the establishment was short stubby balding man in an ill fitting shiny blue suit he stood by the front door and spoke in the soft soothing perpetually eternal always very personal voice men of his profession cultivate hello mister stuck out my hand streeter bradford streeter im here for the margaret whitehurst funeral he ignored the offer to shake hands of course what tragedy yes shock young woman from people like that with everything they have going for them simply can not understand what would cause woman like that to well to kill herself well yes with so much to live for obviously mister morehouse yes ronald ronald morehouse he offered his hand had given up so ignored it wondering where it had been lately obviously mister morehouse maggie did not agree with your assessment of her assets did not mean it sarcastically simply as statement of fact his smile was strained but properly noncommittal the last thing he wanted was discussion like this one was quickly turning into talking about the reasons people voluntarily end up as his customers so obliged and steered the conversation away from the direction it was headed do you know maggie family well for all the time the four of us spent down here on one lark or another we had never visited them had never stopped by for dinner coffee or even to say hello nor had maggie spoken much about them save for her mother who was dead her father had remarried and knew she had sister named madeline mister morehouse eyes brightened and he jumped at the opportunity to gossip little most people here do went to school with margaret father samuel both here for high school and at chapel hill at college the leonard family has lived in pamlico county since well since before the war between the states in banking most of them with the exception of one or two sam leonard is the president of the big bank in the county over in manteo he on the school board and heads up the planning commission too in tuttle where the farm is then you knew maggie oh my heavens yes both she and her sister went to the same church pamlico first baptist he smiled sweet little girls both of them wellbehaved beautiful children little angels it was real tragedy when their mother died that would have been was sandbagging roberta roberta bass leonard oh my remember when she and sam were married it was still the biggest wedding ive ever seen miss roberta was from raleigh sam met her up at school she ended up involved in most everything the library board ladies church group the youth fellowship and the girl scouts she loved those little girls to death maggie certainly thought highly of her mother she was killed in an automobile accident correct think remember maggie mentioned that yes the girls were let see margaret was about twelve and that would have made madeline about ten terrible thing miss roberta just lost control of the car somehow on rainy night on her way inland back to the farm after church dinner it was between manteo and tuttle ran off into the woods and hit big oak must have been tough on the whole family said morehouse winced and nodded his head just about killed old sam he was all weepy for about two years after the accident until he noticed teresa maggie stepmother said yes she was sam secretary at the bank put new life in him that for sure took him in tow did nt give him enough time to feel sorry for himself teresa was young thing pretty as picture she was only twentyfour when she married sam strike it rich you mean was she after his money well maybe at first but by the time she married him think she changed her mind about that sam was pretty well into wallowing around in his sorrows think teresa looked at it as challenge to bring him back to life the old man frowned in thought choosing his words carefully then spoke slowly she married upward but she grew into it pretty well she no miss roberta but she done pretty well in fitting in where she can keeps sam out of trouble what kind of trouble he smiled only slightly most all kinds he said his tone left no doubt that the conversation was over would you like to view the departed before the service begins ve got to take care of some other details he opened door to an office and called to younger man ronnie he said come watch the door while make some phone calls he pointed down short hallway to what looked like two chapel rooms younger version of mister morehouse with little better head of hair took his place by the door to greet the public walked into the viewing room maggie coffin open stood in front of blue curtains trimmed in black copper colored lamp stood at either end of the coffin about forty chairs were arranged in the room four rows of five on either side of center aisle small podium was to the left of the coffin the floral blanket read daughter few other standardissue funeral arrangements were spread around the floor on stands nearby and around the sides of the room an elderly couple sat in the second row on the right they both watched me as entered and walked up to the side of the casket am never prepared to view the departed think stare at the corpse is perhaps better phrase it one of the more deranged rituals of life we put ourselves through or that others choose to put us through however am man who does what expected so walked over to the casket to say goodbye to maggie and stood hands clasped behind my back looking down at her she was not small woman but she looked small lying there in box five foot six maybe better than average looks but not dropdead beautiful on street in supermarket most men would not give her second look not until she turned her full attention on you then you noticed the shine in her very very green eyes the way the light reflected off that auburncolored hair she most often wore it pulled back in pony tail french braid or something you imagined it down down to her shoulders because that how long it was when you spoke her eyes never left yours she hung on every word and touched you when she made point that what you remembered most the touch the touch that said for that one fleeting moment you were someone special it was that touch that made you in solitary intervals remember the shape of her legs her lips well hey im not talking about you talking about me talking about what happened to me when was around maggie whitehurst will not flatter myself to think that she was as intrigued with me as was with her except perhaps for short time was not used to seeing her dressed as she was today like this in plain blue business suit with highnecked blouse no doubt to cover the rope burns on her neck and who knows what they did at the morgue her hair though was every bit as beautiful down as remembered seeing it on those few occasions she made goodlooking corpse but the problem was she looked dead no matter how good the job the embalmer does how lifelike the corpse looks its still corpse whatever life was in that vessel has indeed departed perhaps gone to another depending on your spiritual view but certainly gone from this life forever would have preferred to have remembered maggie differently than this she had her faults but she was as full of life and honesty as any person have known or am likely to know our affair had started as one of those couples trips in fact the last one the four of us ever took late last summer we went to the outer banks often over the years we had known each other renting cottage for weekend or sometimes week this time it was weeklong trip after labor day after the rental rates dropped the cottage was good one an expensive one modern one two stories all light woods formica chrome and glass it went for thirteen hundred dollars per week during the season this particular week the rate was four hundred dollars white gazebo atop dune overlooked the atlantic we arrived on friday night with enough time to unpack and cook dinner on the barbecue and take little walk on the beach before turning in all the next day saturday we had done the usual things spent little quiet time after breakfast visited some of the shops along what passes for the waterfront strip even visited the wright brothers museum for the third or fourth time we saw movie ate dinner at one of the better restaurants and went back to the cottage all of us little tipsy barbara and had good time think at least did we did not act like husband and wife toward each other we acted as friends knew our marriage was in trouble and had been for some time it was the thing we did nt talk about the big elephant in the living room that you put doily and vase of flowers on make it look like it belongs like it part of the furniture but no one ever says says what the hell is fucking elephant doing in the living room there was always certain amount of sexual tension involved in these foursome outings working at very low almost subconscious level sometimes we would swap spouses for shopping trips museum visits or even an occasional movie that the odd couple wanted to see sometimes maggie and found ourselves holding hands as we walked along the beach or in the theatre know bobby and barbara did the same we had never acted on any of this except to speculate once or twice about what the neighbors might think if they saw us paired off this way it was at the most titillating flirtatious and fun the fact that any one of us could be little excited by holding the opposite spouse always found slightly amusing honestly did not know that bobby and maggie marriage was in trouble as well thought sensed some distance some withdrawal on the part of one or both of them but figured was probably projecting some of my own problems on them so filed it away barbara and had our own things to deal with or had to deal with what our situation was becoming perhaps friendly disengagement but pending parting of the ways nonetheless that night after falling asleep in bed next to barbara dreamed of reaching out waking her and telling her gently that she was my friend and that recognized her pain that if being with someone else or simply being away from me would relieve that pain would do what could to help just needed sign from her that it was all right that separation would be good thing comfortable thing that it would relieve what was feeling too was not at all sure that would be the case if as my friend she could reassure me about it all it might be bit easier awakened damp with perspiration and bit frightened so restless had decided to walk up to the gazebo have smoke and stare out at the ocean for while the gazebo was about hundred feet from the beach and the roar of the surf was deafening in supposing would be unnoticed either by barbara or by bobby or maggie though was only partially right maggie found me lost in my own thoughts she sneaked right up what are you doing out here she shouted turned with start having smoke clearing out my head we were both yelling over the insistent rush of the surf but not your lungs huh she laughed and moved closer was the only one of the four of us who smoked it was constant source of needling from maggie shrugged everyone has an addiction or two just happy mine is nt for cute tenyearold boys she gave impish grin and sly wink wo nt barbara miss you are nt you two doing what people come down here for little romance little heavy breathing took another drag of the cigarette and exhaled heavily not this time maggie it has nt been that way for while know me neither she said the silly mocking tone disappeared quickly and she turned to stare out at the ocean the waves breaking endlessly upon the beach maggie said you go through cycles in marriage up little down little does it all average out it was the argument given barbara if not me who if not barbara who who would love me who would care about me why could not bring myself to face facts threw the cigarette butt down in mild disgust and stepped on it maggie kept staring out at the ocean for few more seconds before she turned and touched my arm that touch not this time brad think bobby and have pretty well bottomed out bobby keeps looking for the big score the deal that going to get us out of debt let us let him feel comfortable enough to start family to get on to where we need to be something more he says he keeps looking for it he promises he ll keep looking but sure he not convinced it what he wants he comfortable in getting by keeping the bills paid he does nt want to get ahead tired of treading water brad if you dont move ahead you sink sinking she squeezed my arm for emphasis can feel it unless get out of this marriage and move ahead going down for the third time ca nt do that wo nt do that how about you and barbara she asked an eyebrow raised are you going to give it little time patient guy but you know barbara better than me said you two shop and lunch and do all that female bonding stuff you tell me tell me the truth you do nt want the truth brad you re too busy being patient and good and kind and it not what you are at all you re too busy working at being the good guy youre too busy trying to be the one who right the wronged man the stoic figure who can hold his head up high beat on his chest and say this marriage did nt fail because of me did nothing to bring this upon myself you re so busy working on that because you ve given up on the relationship you re already working on how you ll see yourself after it breaks apart you want the truth okay the truth is maybe you could have saved it just maybe barbara would nt have drifted away if you had spent little more time on the relationship instead of working fourteen hour days maybe barbara did nt care if you were big time highpaid network correspondent by the time you were forty like you did maybe just maybe barbara wants fulltime husband who hangs out around the house fixes the busted faucet and makes babies with her the truth is that you do nt have any time left she going to pull the plug brad she waiting for the right time but she going to pull the plug you big jerk and you know it it not if anymore it when you re nice guy and she doesnt want to hit you while you re down but it coming not tomorrow not the next day but soon snapped at her you re full of shit of course she was right not only right but it was direct hit mine was only what the military people call secondary explosion but that was about all could think of to say at the time denial may not be good thing but it has its handy uses maggie moved closer to me and put her arm around my waist could smell the citrus of her perfume even above the wind instinctively pulled her closer turned her to face me and put both arms around her the truth she said is that you are nice guy and not at all stupid about what going on another squeeze and the truth is that wish had you your drive where you will be some day and that barbara had bobby she buried her head into my neck sighed and shuddered little it sure would make lot more sense that way we held each other for very long time just standing there in the gazebo holding on what happened that night between the two of us was really irrelevant to what was about to happen to the four of us whether we made love or not the fates of our respective marriages were already in the cards and we all knew what they were maggie and were simply fellow travelers on roads that converged for short time did nt know just then did know that had thought about taking maggie hair down all night so did and so after my separation from barbara maggie and became lovers for few months it would not last knew that then but let it happen anyway when persons world is falling apart as felt mine was at the time that person will grab on to anything using maggie metaphor to keep from going down that third time maggie spoke the last words either of us said that night hold on she said it going to be bumpy ride iii would have liked to have thought my relationship with maggie broke faith with no one but certainly bobby would have felt betrayed had he known was still not sure he did nt know about it barbara broke the news on sunday night in august while we watched the late news usually the paragon of fashion even in leisure she had been moping around all weekend in sweat shirt and ratty shorts speaking in monosyllables and saying over and over again she did nt feel well said are you feeling better she said no said still feeling lousy she said yes said is something wrong besides feeling lousy she said yes want divorce well hey was the one who asked did not sleep well that night barbara slept on the couch guess packed and moved on monday first into hotel on the strip then into the duplex above wesley on the weekend got an attorney signed the separation agreement and sulked for two months worked lot putting in sixty seventy hour weeks volunteering for all the overtime could get at the television station sifted through records at courthouses drove to richmond once or twice and broke several big stories about corruption and crime when it feels like someone has taken your world turned it upside down and shaken it it comforting to have something familiar to turn to for me it was my work it always had been it was one of the problems according to barbara anyway after couple of months of pouting was at the mall one friday night aimlessly shopping wondering if spending money would make me feel better watching people and still pouting when ran into bobby and barbara we made small talk funny how you can share the most intimate things as couples but feel awkward when one of the four wheels falls off caught them up on what was doing with myself looked at my watch and ducked into movie theatre quickly to see picture cared nothing about just to get out of the awkwardness of the situation the next afternoon fell asleep with beer on the couch while watching football game cared nothing about there was knock at the sliding glass door that awakened me looked at the clock it was about six opened the curtains and there stood maggie on the deck almost silhouetted against the purple fall sky wearing denim jacket plaid flannel shirt and white twill slacks the breeze off the bay was chilly with the sun down and blew her hair around her neck where bobby asked gone to charlottesville for the football game she said he getting drunk with the good old boys he ll be driving back in the morning where are you asked here nothing ruins rhetorical question like literal answer will you do me favor she asked sure what kiss me hold me make love to me stepped out onto the deck and took her into my arms we kissed and then took her hand and led her to my bedroom is nt this where we re supposed to say gee she looks so lifelike or something turned toward the voice and looked into maggie green eyes same hair same mouth same green eyes younger but not by much little hipperlooking hello madeline brad streeter said offering my hand sorry to trash the script but she does nt look too lifelike to me she looks dead yep dead the woman said she took my hand in firm grip friends call me mary mary leonard sister of the deceased she winced sorry about that crack not sure know how to act at these things nodded death affects people in different ways looked around the chapel it was filling rapidly not big crowd by my standards but probably large enough for tuttle north carolina mary was wearing black dress kneelength fairly plain but elegant what you would call cocktail dress guess under other circumstances but suitable for mourning you were bobby and maggie neighbor right yes are you the one she had the affair with before she and bobby split direct question deserves direct answer when in doubt tell the truth yes said want to sit okay she led the way to the back of the folding chairs we sat in silence although have to admit took good look at her once or twice the resemblance was striking barbara joined the party just as the organ music began she looked better than had seen her in some time of course had not seen her at all for about six months or so since the hearing to finalize the divorce she nodded and mouthed hello as she walked to the front she was wearing navy suit with white blouse dark stockings and black pumps she had let her hair grow and had darkened the color it had always looked sort of dishwater blonde now it looked pleasant light shade of brown thumbed through the program for the funeral the reverend scott thomas would be presiding with jessica copal at the keyboard bobby arrived in threepiece suit followed by grayhaired man with what was learning were leonard eyes immaculately dressed in pinstriped number and much younger blonde woman in black dress assumed they were maggie father and stepmother ms copal launched into amazing grace few moments later the reverend thomas appeared from behind the blue curtain mary leonard looked at me and at eyebrow went up showtime she said bobby sat in the front row next to barbara on one side of the aisle old man leonard and the woman on the other one glance between bobby and the sam leonard said it all mary leonard said no more jessica copal was competent at the keyboard but the good reverend thomas was boring as hell it became immediately obvious that he had never met maggie bobby maybe not even old sam leonard the only thing he got right was what waste it all seemed bobby and sam leonard were still glaring at each other when they and four other men loaded maggie up into the hearse the rain had stopped for now but it looked as if it could start up again anytime the wind was still blowing pretty strong was getting into my car when mary leonard trotted over to the passenger side and put her hand on the handle mind if ride with you no problem said kind of figured you be riding with your father though he got whatshername to ride with right whatever crossed over to her side of the car and opened the door the two mister morehouses senior and junior handed out the little magnetic flags to put on our cars and reminded us to turn on our headlights for the trip to the cemetery gray police cruiser sat in front of the hearse ronald senior said we be going to the family burial plot off main road near the leonard farm that we be running stop signs and traffic signals and to stay close to the car ahead mary and rode in silence for the first couple of miles through farmland felt compelled to make pleasant conversation when you do nt know what to talk about talk about the other person maggie did nt talk about her family much said hoping that did nt sound like some kind of judgment she had nt been close to any of us for some time mary said she continued to stare out the window what mean is said do nt know much about your family mister morehouse said your father is banker that right she said he got more money than you can imagine smiled little can imagine quite bit well she said he got more than can imagine or most of the folks around here can imagine what do you do asked little of this and little of that she said right now working at dress shop at one of the hotels it was awful she said finally pulling cigarette from her purse marlboro if it matters and lighting it with one of those slender little precious metal lighters with the little rollerthing on the side almost startled she looked at me quickly is this alright smoking in your car mean yes said and fished salem out of my sport coat and lit it with my bic you mean saturday said yes daddy called me at about two sunday morning mean knew she been depressed but did nt think she do something like this still have hard time believing she gone you two were close asked not exactly but we gotten closer since she come down how long had she been down here asked about six weeks she was still making trips to virginia beach to see therapist and really thought she had been making some progress she talked about the future what she wanted to do after the divorce was final she shook her head did you know she wanted to paint no but knew she had some talent in that direction she wanted to paint mary leonard was crying watching the tobacco fields go by at the cemetery it was the standard stuff ashes to ashes dust to dust the reverend thomas standard protestant graveside speech kept hoping it would nt begin raining again after the final amen mary plucked rose from one of the wreaths and the workmen began cranking the coffin into the ground barbara who pretty much had ignored me up until now walked over to where stood with mary mary leonard my exwife barbara barbara mary barbara said to mary was saddened to hear about your sister death as sure brad has told you we were very close with maggie and bobby yes mary said very close excuse me please ive got to speak with some friends tight smile and poof gone barbara turned to me how have you been doing brad unemployed but well you read about your loss in the paper sorry brad know your job meant lot to you ve been well im studying for real estate license not great lately but not bad business to be into around virginia beach said was the split between maggie and bobby nasty not really she just packed up the car and left one afternoon she waited for bobby to get home and told him she needed to get away for while her sister said she was still seeing therapist at the beach think so but to tell you the truth we have nt talked much since since you moved out and all yeah know how it goes could nt help but wonder how much barbara really knew about what had happened between maggie and me the crowd was thinning quickly probably the weather offered to buy barbara dinner she politely declined mary leonard had vanished watched barbara get into the big mercury alone and drive away even the reverend thomas had split it was me the old couple and the two cemetery workers who were just starting to fire up the backhoe few yards away it was close to five oclock walked over to the mustang and drove away sevenelevens grow like weeds in this part of the world if it looks like any development is coming soon anywhere the southland corporation cranks all the numbers into its massive mainframe computer somewhere and decides it time for another seveneleven or maybe two or three in some suburban areas they re built right across the street from one another so that you do nt have to make left turn to pick up the bread and milk on the way home left turns are bad for business as approached civilization and the hotel pulled into one and picked up cold six of stroh better than paying ten bucks for it at the armada parked the mustang and threw my sport coat in the back seat along with my shoes and socks rolled up my pantlegs popped the top on cold one stuck another in my pocket and walked down the beach do nt know how far walked maybe five miles or maybe it seemed like five miles it was one beer worth walked to where the hotels stop and the beach houses begin sat on the beach and stared out at the surf for good long time finished the first beer dropped the can into barrel and opened the second it was warm there were dynamics at work here that did nt understand bobby and sam leonard maggie and mary maggie and mary and their stepmother told myself it was none of my business told myself the relationship with maggie whatever it had been had been over long before she had made the decision to leave this world maggie did not love me did not know me well enough to love me or me her but it had nt been that long and had to admit that whatever misguided feelings had about love had felt as if loved maggie or could love her or wanted to love her or something whatever it was it hurt so cried the tears of loss and pain and little guilt too for what might have been with maggie and with barbara and with the other women had known in my lifetime the sky was beginning to clear walked back to the car as finished the second beer and grabbed my coat and the remaining fourpack out of the back seat when got back to the room put the beer on ice in the sink and took long hot shower shaved dressed in white slacks and polo shirt and went downstairs for dinner it was about eightthirty as passed the bar headed for the dining room it was the same hoarse rough sounding voice from the funeral home hey streeter mary leonard was positioned at the end of the bar with view of the entry into the dining room she still wore the black dress from this afternoon but she did nt look like she was mourning anymore it really looked like cocktail dress she was sitting with legs crossed smoking cigarette an empty glass stood on the bar hello mary said buy you drink how about drink and dinner she arched one eyebrow okay she picked up her purse and we went into the dining room followed and noticed that mary had not only the same coloring but much the same shape as her sister where maggie was soft however there seemed to be just little bit of an edge about mary she may have been maggies younger sister but she looked just little older little more worldly if that makes any sense we were seated at table near the window the dark clouds still hung over the ocean to the east but it was obviously clearing to the west because the setting sun outlined long shadows in orange across the beach mary ordered another drink vodka tonic ordered another beer stroh if they had it bud if they did nt the waiter said he be right back with bud the service was nice she said while we waited for our drinks the day turned out nice at least she was looking out at the ocean got the impression that the minister did nt know maggie well said not since we were kids well you re right it was nice service brief lull as both of stared out at the ocean does your father get along with bobby daddy does nt get along with much of anyone she said as the drinks arrived the waiter placed them atop the obligatory napkins and departed especially bobby she said do you know why bobby was little older than maggie daddy was always real protective of the two of us did nt want us to go on dates until we were sixteen and did nt really want us to do it then either but you ca nt exactly tell sixteen year old girl not to go on dates for christ sake so daddys little girls were growing up and daddy did nt like it one little bit would hear them fighting when she came home late from her dates could hear him yelling at the boys out in the driveway and could hear him yelling at maggie downstairs after they left mary took large swallow of the vodka tonic he called her things like slut and whore and wanted to know every little detail of every date was your stepmother much help no always felt like she married daddy for the money she treated us alright she never hurt us much but she would nt stick up for us like mother still does nt much mostly when daddy got into one of his moods like that shed just leave the room and go upstairs and take sleeping pill teresa just does nt care about us much one way or another well mean did nt mean her voice was quivering little god she really dead maggies really dead just like daddy said she stared out the window for couple of seconds then polished off the drink do you want to order asked order me another drink please she said putting the glass back on the napkin and ll look at the menu after get back from powdering my nose having good cry and blotting up the mess she rose quickly and left motioned to the waiter and ordered another drink for mary pass this round the eastern sky was dark now and could see the lights of the ships running up and down the coast coal carriers mostly taking virginia coal to south america was attracted to mary she had sharp tongue and quick wit was it that or the fact that she resembled maggie lot was attracted to mary or maggie all over again or just any woman how well did know maggie how well had known any of the women who had been in my life including my wife doctor al avery my shrink says should ask myself questions like this well he does nt exactly say it rather he asks questions like this and expects me by osmosis to ask them to myself never sure if theyre real questions or rhetorical ones shrinks never tell you what to do they simply ask questions that lead you to believe they re telling you what to do are you saying should think about this more say what do you think about that he replies this type of behavior is known as analyzing the analyst and is frowned upon by virtually the entire analyzing community but then we were talking about me and not them go figure mary returned cigarette in hand and plopped down with great exhalation of air well she said glad that over with been wondering when the good cry was going to come feel better asked for now probably not for long the waiter returned to take our order ordered steak medium rare while mary perused the menu she ordered stuffed flounder the waiter nodded his approval clicked his ballpoint offered me another beer which declined and left so why did maggie move back here asked why not move in with you or with some friends or out on her own she was going to move in with me mary said or thats what she told me but she said there were some things she had to do first if the relationship with your father was nt good moving to the farm could nt have been much fun said do nt think it was daddy did nt really want to take her back but teresa talked him into it teresa talked him into it your stepmother yeah why do nt exactly know she said maybe she wanted to make up for not being there before before when when daddy cut maggie off and kicked her out mean she was ready to move out and tell him to stuff it anyway but she moved up to williamsburg and started going to william and mary studying art and she got involved with some boy up there brian something was his name daddy did nt like it so when he got her grades and they were nt what he thought they should have been he cut off her money and told her not to bother coming home what did she do then got job as legal secretary and met bobby at real estate closing he was sweet and polite and romantic he treated her real nice at the time took her places sent her flowers and all that shit had heard the story of how they met but did nt know the background the waiter served salad daddy got real mad see he wanted her to come crawling and begging back home saying she was sorry for how much she screwed up her life and would he please take her back and how she be good girl and all that crap mary said she did nt do it she got job trained herself really found guy and married him real quick just to have someone to take care of her and bobby real sweet but he sort of bubba you know like there all these guys who go out and drink beer on saturdays and watch football games and do all that guy stuff and about every other one of them is nicknamed bubba well bobby is bubba whether that his nickname or not he just good ole boy lawyer looking for the big score that will keep him in budweiser and big screen satellite dish football games for life and fishing of course and maggie finally decided she wanted more she thought she deserved more so she left him she was going to figure out way to go back to school she was going to get job here and start going back to the community college then transfer the credits back to william and mary or nc state or somewhere else did nt know she was that unhappy with bobby said bobby real hard guy to get mad at she said hes just so darned amiable is that the word yes oh good the waiter appeared with our meals and made the appropriate little flourishes as he put them in front of us mary stubbed out her cigarette bobby is nice guy just not very ambitious or romantic or loving or intimate maggie was his wife and he expected to keep the house look good at parties and give him little roll in the hay once or twice week she got tired of it maggie did nt talk about your father much or you either for that matter that not surprising we were nt very close for long time at least not until recently the liquor was beginning to catch up with her recently came out re schentlee she finished up the glass that what you said things got better when maggie moved back yes she said she was going to move in with me like told you we were going to be roommates the word told came out tole really yes but then she went and killed herself but enough about me and my dead sister let talk about you and my dead sister mary was now more than little drunk so how was she in bed maggie that is winced mary do not embarrass easily but youre testing the limits here do you really expect me to answer that question suppose not she said you were pretty much gentleman and that you did nt tell anyone she said you were she was groping for word helped her discreet yeah that it discreet it came out dishkreet learn new word every day so you said you and maggie were getting closer asked she looked out the window at the ocean then back at me let say we had some things in common like what the men in our lives or maybe should say the man in our lives twirled the cocktail napkin had been playing with give up said she smiled silly drunken smile why silly daddy of course he was screwing both of us when we were kids that why she dead she was going to confront him
