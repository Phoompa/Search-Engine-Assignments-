questions she looked at the badge nervously and nodded the door closed for second then opened again sans chain please come in he slipped his badge back into his pocket as he walked into the house the living room was decorated in generic suburban middleclass everything in pale blue the normallooking ones were always the ones to watch out for she gestured to the sofa wo nt you sit down she took seat in the recliner did nt lean back sat forward at attention what this all about he could tell she was scared that should make it easier he pulled out his notebook computer and tapped the screen to call up her file according to the hospital your pregnancy terminated three days ago she bit her lip yyes the doctors said there was nothing they could do that your second miscarriage in two years mrs jones he snapped taking full advantage of her hesitation care to explain that ca nt she said weakly her lower lip trembled as she tried not to cry my doctor wants to run complete hormone scan as soon as he can he afraid that he thinks might not be able to carry to term that was an excuse he had nt heard in while his manner softened little just in case she was nt lying sorry but this is standard procedure now how soon after conception was the pregnancy reported do nt know exactly his eyebrows went up you have nt been taking your weekly pregnancy tests that misdemeanor you know no no she said quickly mean yes ve been taking the tests you can check with my doctor what meant was dont know how many days it was at least two maybe three or four he nodded and made note of that well that within acceptable range no trouble there and you went on the diet as soon as you tested positive oh yes she smiled little but it was mostly sad smile my husband and have been trying to have baby for almost three years he grunted he heard that before assume your husband can corroborate that no drugs including tobacco or alcohol she shook her head no caffeine another shake not quite so certain you re sure no coffee tea cola chocolate she gave tiny gasp forgot had an ice cream cone and when was this um about two weeks ago think have to check my dietary log she looked at him helplessly did nt want to do it had craving another grunt ll take look at your log in minute anything else you ve forgotten do nt think so do you work outside the home mrs jones yes customer service representative at the airport complaint department huh when did you go on leave had another five weeks before my mandatory leave deadline she smiled that sad smile again was going to take leave as soon as my husband got another assignment he contract programmer and things have been little slow you were nt aware that customer service representative is listed as highstress occupation mandatory leave date for hsos is four months not six he glared at her accusingly and clicked his light pen off like to see your medicine cabinet she rose and led him to the stairs he looked at the steps critically assume you do nt run up and down these stairs not unless have to she shrank under his stare the only bathroom is upstairs and then sometimes the cat he cut her off quite effectively by walking up the stairs he glanced into the bedroom and saw nothing out of the ordinary he went into the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet he clicked his pen on and began to record all the medications there both prescription and overthecounter he paused at one bottle based on the date filled the dosage and guess at the number of tablets remaining this might be violation what this he turned and showed it to her that for my allergies she smiled apologetically this time of year can barely see without them you ve been taking this she flinched my doctor said it was okay he said it was on the safe list it was until three weeks ago the fda announced that this compound was shown to cause birth defects in laboratory mice and they took it off the safe list she clapped her hands over her mouth did nt know ignorance is no excuse he pocketed the bottle and closed the medicine cabinet going to have to take you in for questioning mrs jones whwhat abuse of an unborn child suspicion of murder she shrank away in horror you think lost the baby on purpose maybe maybe not we have to check it out he shrugged they ll probably only charge you with negligent homicide anyway she let out wail that would have split his soul if he hadnt heard hundreds like it before she collapsed to the floor convulsed with hysterical sobbing and once again he thought about asking for transfer from the fetal homicide division it had seemed so natural when he joined ensuring that unborn children had full rights under the law from the moment of conception but after two years he was nt so sure anymore he patted her lightly on the shoulder useless gesture of sympathy hey do nt get so upset he murmured as he found her wrists and put the handcuffs on if your hormone scans do come back abnormal you ll get off with involuntary manslaughter tops in 1994 congress passed the human life act which states the life of human being is considered to begin at conception with all rights under the law unborn persons have right to life which can not be infringed the law was cheered as great victory by the prolife movement and people who expressed reservations that the law was too sweeping and general were largely ignored feminist activists fought to have the last sentence stricken from the law arguing that according to the act men and children are always afforded the right to life but women are only guaranteed the right to life when they are not pregnant the supreme court upheld the human life act in two separate cases in 1996 the ruling in the first case tennessee vs newkirk effectively outlawed not only abortion but also many forms of birth control including all forms of the pill and iud in the second case louisiana vs andrews the court upheld conviction of seconddegree murder against woman who sought and obtained an illegal abortion the majority opinion stated under the law there is no difference between fetus of four weeks and child of four years any woman who knowingly and willfully causes the death of her unborn child can be considered as guilty of premeditated murder as if she had knowingly and willfully caused the death of any other human being wave of other laws followed most notably the fetal rights act of 1997 stating that women who knowingly use substances harmful to the fetus during pregnancy can be charged with child abuse originally intended to protect the unborn children of female drug addicts the law was quickly extended to all harmful substances tobacco alcohol sodium caffeine and prescription and overthe counter drugs including antibiotics and aspirin the american medical association challenged the fetal rights act on the grounds that the law was unenforceable women could easily go as long as six weeks before they even realized they were pregnant to facilitate enforcement many states initiated weekly mandatory pregnancy testing for all women of childbearing age and ordered that all positive pregnancy tests be reported to health and human services immediately upon notification of positive pregnancy test women were required to begin diet approved by the surgeon general and maintain daily dietary log to prove their compliance in some states pregnant women also became subject to random drug tests similar to those given to probationers or parolees women rights groups and the aclu have challenged the mandatory pregnancy tests and random drug tests on the grounds that it violated women right to privacy effectively treating pregnant women like criminals so far the fetal rights act has been upheld in all cases when later studies showed the stress had detrimental effect on fetuses congress passed the prenatal leave act of 1999 requiring working women to leave their jobs no later that the six month of their pregnancy and no later than the fourth month if they were in an occupation designated as highstress the women employment rights act of 1999 which required companies to provide job security and unpaid prenatal leaves to female employees as well as to continue medical insurance coverage for women on prenatal leaves was struck down as unconstitutional the maternity rights bill originally proposed in 1983 would require companies to guarantee six weeks unpaid maternity leave to female employees it has so far failed to pass either house of congress
