once there was fish doug rosentrater once there was fish who lived in the great ocean and because the water was transparent and always conviently got out of his nose when he moved along he reallly did nt know that he was in the ocean one day this fish did very dangerous thing he began to think surely am most remarkable being he thought since can move around like this in the missle of empty space then the fish became confused because of his thinking about his moving and swimming and he suddenly had an anxiety paroxysm and thought that he had forgotten how at the same moment he looked down and saw the yawning chasm of the ocean depths stretching below him and he was terrified that he would drop then he thought desperately if could catch hold of my tail in my mouth could hold myself up and so he curled himself up the best he could and snapped at his tail unfortunately his spine was nt quite supple enough and so he missed as he went on trying to catch hold of his tail the yawning black abyss below became even more terrible he began to slowly drift down since he was nt swimming anymore and the poor fish found himself on the edge of total nervous breakdown just then shark who had been watching with mixed feelings of pity and amusement said what are you doing the fish looked up surprised to see the shark and replied terrified of falling so am trying to hold myself up but ca nt reach my tail and with this he started nervously sobbing and drifting farther down well if that is the case then why have nt you fallen into the depths before this inquiored th shark in slow voice of course had nt fallen down earlier because because was swimming oh said the shark then why do nt you stop biting your tail and go back to swimming the fish gasped and suddenly realized that all of his fears were his own fault he started swimming and immediately came back up to the shark level you know said the shark the great ocean supports you all the time you swim but here you are instead of exploring its length breadth and depth wasting absolutely wasting your time exploring nothing but your own end if you do nt wise up quickly then you might as well be stone instead of fish and with that the shark drifted off to find his lunch somewhere from then on the fish put his own end behind him where it belonged and set out to explore the great ocean secure in the knowledge that as long as he swam he would nt fall
