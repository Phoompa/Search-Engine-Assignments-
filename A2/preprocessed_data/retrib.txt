not going to make it but then figured it somehow make it easier ll be harder to see and can walk if have to so the pain quits even planned out exactly how to park the truck in the trees out back so nobody ll see it and so quiet ca nt even hear myself pulling the rifle out from behind the seat running armystyle across the field crawling under the fence ducking behind the garage coupla years ago back when had the good job brought home some barrels you know for trash and stuff boy did catch hell for that anyway had to put em back there used them to get to the roof knew theyd still be there she never took care of anything was so stealthy rambo woulda been proud so crawl up on the garage roof which was major achievement cause it wet and slick as ice scramble up to the peak and look over it where can see the driveway and the back of the house man was pumped like when you re about thirteen and you ve got your favorite magazine in the bathroom with you and your dad suddenly starts pounding on the door excuse me you probably never did that did nt see my car mean her car in the drive so knew everything was perfect hung on to the peak and waited remember checking my scope couple of times and wiping the rain off must ve closed my eyes for minute cause the pictures started again can we skip this part little joey yeah laughing and running and were kicking this soft little soccer ball around the back yard really do nt want to get into this what so tell me this mr wiseguy why is it that catharsis and catheter sound so much alike all right watching these pictures stop action joey stops in midkick and his little face turns all sober with tears running down his cheeks like the day left cattleprod in the gut stuff and then in the morgue whoa pal not going into this again told you million times told you how she swore she get me that accident story is pure bullcrap usda inspected prime hey she even used to get me when was graying graying you know sliding from awake to sleep when you re laying perfectly still cause you re too far gone to move yet your mind is still going you re in the gray zone you ca nt move but you re just awake enough to know it and you ca nt make it stop she lay there right next to me and whisper over and over had to be cheating on her had to be cheating who was it with who was cheating with tell me had to be and why was lying about it telling me how she knew had to be doing it and how the minute she had proof she was gon na take knife to certain private part my part yeah never heard that part before you think im gon na tell you everything that slaps around up here you think crazy how many more times do have to tell you she the one who should be in here not me look ll make you deal ll stay if you put her in here too but she got ta be in another building and nobody but nobody tells her where am not the topic not the topic man you re persistent okay so must have fallen asleep cause the next thing know sliding down the roof grabbing for my rifle got right to the edge before stopped too sat there staring at my hands thinking is nt this funny my fingernails are gone but do nt feel thing bout here is where hear the car coming so scramble back up to the top looking back at it ca nt figure how she did nt see me here my head sitting like pumpkin on top of the garage and the headlights are starin me right in the face the lights go out and the engine dies and now ve got the crosshairs on her door she always took so damned long to get out of the car used to drive me nuts but that okay this time use my time slow and quiet bring the bolt back then forward and down and wait the door opens and she getting out and my thumb reaches for the safety she just standing there and ca nt decide headorheart headorheart headorheart cold and wet as it was was sweating all over finally rest the crosshairs on her chest man she had big chest so pushing off the safety trying not to let it click and the other door opens she brought somebody home with her lay there thinking the poor dummy he does nt know what she ll do to him and should do her now and save him from her he comes around the car and puts his arm around her and they start toward the house and almost yell run run before she gets you too but hunker down and aim again can still get her in the back of the head before it too late never wear street shoes if you re going up on roof especially wet one screw you over every time they re too close together anyway besides never do stranger poor dope just going in for quickie thing is he never knows what it really gon na cost is nt his fault mean fell for it did nt at least he had the decency to pull the curtains wait wet clear through and teeth sounding like maracas like figured they came out about an hour later took the safety off as soon as saw the back door open knew what to go for this time and waited as they came toward me hey was loving it major turn on mean was excited waited until they separated to get in the car the rifle was slick in my hands but was too busy fighting the shivers to be bothered settled the crosshairs on the bridge of her nose and waited for the right the exact right split second moment as it came slowly squeezed the trigger got ta admit that was the closest ever came to total body orgasm guys can have them you know read it somewhere lying there and thinking ve got you now you babykilling whore ll fix no am fixing your nasty old hide and there no way you can bs your way outa this one and threaten all you want now it ai nt gon na save you you re gutsplatters now you always were and you dont even know where it coming from all that stuff all at once at that exact moment remember rolling away and my damned shoes sliding and the next thing on the ground and she screaming and the guy coming around the garage hurt like hell but had to get up cause the guy was coming and wanted to look dignified when he shook my hand and thanked me for saving his little backside bout then it hit me that he did nt really know what she could do to man and maybe he was nt all that thankful thought about using the rifle for crutch but no it would slow me down and felt that could fly if wanted to anyway so left it half way across the field when hear him shout little dummy ran into the electric fence then is when it hit me here this guy who should be sending me fan mail for trying to save his butt and instead he busting it trying to catch me musta been real fright sitting there in my truck wet through caked in mud having to use my left foot on the gas pedal cause my right broken and laughing my fool head off fat rambo on nitrous oxide swear do nt know how he got there so fast he could nt have do nt you think have heard or felt something if have really run over him do nt you think it would have left some kind of mark on the truck it her fault the vengeful witch going back to my room now okay never really meant to hurt anybody mean look did nt even buy any ammo for the rifle
