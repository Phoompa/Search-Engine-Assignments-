page part one about this manual hello my name ratpouch the real star of the game and at the very beginning of the game very near to where you re pacing around in your cell honest that close that in spitting distancewhich is very apt as am the sort of person who usually gets spat at especially since the skorl have come to town they do nt care too much for my jokes and this is always getting me into trouble the spitting could take but being stretched on ye olde rack just do nt find very amusing still do nt want to burden you with my troublesthough if you could somehow rescue me would be paternally grateful better explain what going on and where you come in or ll be stuck here forever prepare to enter the village of turnvale prepare yourself for the experience known as virtual theatre page nine so what this virtual theatre all about it very good question and it one that has nt been answered before because lure of the temptress is the first virtual theatre game ever written imagine for moment that you are involved in real life scenarioyou re standing in room which looks out through window onto village courtyard yes village courtyard with cobblestones and let say that there are three people standing in the courtyard stuka python and bagpuss if you were to look out of your window you might notice that stuka and python were having conversationabout how many atari st owners it would take to change lightbulb you might also notice that bagpuss who is only interested in not getting his long hair wet and is not interested in atari owners is sauntering towards the building that you are in sure enough he dissappears from the courtyard and click the door to your right opens in walks bagpuss let say that bagpuss wants to talk to you about hair wash day or something then you would turn to face himas one would once your conversation with bagpuss is over he turns away from you and with flash of golden curls exits through the door closing it behind him and you presume has strolled back into the courtyard so you look through the window to check and horror he is nt there not sign of him the courtyard is bagpussless stuka and python are there waffling on about how two atari st owners linked their machines up and made calculator but bagpuss is nowhere to be seen so where is he page ten if this real life scenario you ve just read could easily happen in the lure of the temptress ll now ask this question where would bagpuss be if he were in the world of virtual theatre give up well if the lure of the temptress was called totally imaginary theatre you would probably just decide that bagpuss had just dissappeared other adventure games are like that after all however this game is virtual theatre and things are just little bit more realistic people just dont dissappear and if bagpuss is not in the courtyard then one of two things must have happened he either waiting on the other side of the door or he taken another exit from the building an exit which leads away from the courtyard and which can not be seen from the window page eleven so you open the door to find out except you ca nt bagpuss has obviously locked the door after him typical in your pockets you find spare key and so you open the door to find out what has happened to bagpuss he not there but as you expexted there is another exit which bypasses the courtyard so you set off in hot pursuit you find yourself in an alleyway it empty then another alleyway empty then you find yourself by hairdressers has bagpuss gone inside or has he taken another route and gone somewhere totally different like to buy pair of new earings from some shady man in pub you ll never catch him now if he has so you decide to look inside the hairdressers after opening the door of course and there is bagpuss his hair in rollers and pina colada in one hand he stares at you angrily suddenly you feel like talking about atari st owners so you decide to retrace your steps and find stuka and python again back at the cobbled courtyard but they re not there the loons back you go into the room you started from to see if you can see them from the window nope they re gone what did you expect though this is virtual theatre it like life you ca nt see something if it is nt there anymore page twelve all the characters involved in the story and there are many lead little lives of their own they walk here the walk there they do this they do that and they talk to other characters exchanging bits of gossip and information and you of course can join in but before you dive in wait as explain who you are where you are what to do and how to do it read on mes ames page thirteen part threewho on earth am you are diermot an unwilling hero who prefer quiet life and are to all intents and purposes good man after decades of unrest the king has united the warring factions in his kingdom and all his lands are at peace well nearly all of them because there still one dodgy area lefta remote region around town called turnvale revolt has recently taken place in turnvale revolt orchastrated by an apprentice sorceress called selena that all that is known the king not very pleased with this rounds up his finest horsemen and with you in tow they set off for turnvale as night turns to dawn and the riders draw near to turnvale the mists rise to reveal not as expected pathetic resistance force made up of peasants with pitchforks but an army of grotesque creatures the likes of which have never been seen before they are as it happens hellish mercenary monsters known as the skorl page forteen the skorl are all armed to the teeth the battle which ensues is less of battle and more of massacre in which the horsemen are slaughtered and the king is killed you however are nt even hurtwell not much anywayyou fall off your horse and bang your head on the ground everything suddenly so suidgy in the old braincells it almost like going to sleep only little bit more of the old pain is involved your lights as they say go out page fifteen part four where on earth am you are gon na be on your own for this because due to printing error the exact manual have got hold of has in fact got an almost blank page page sixteen wish there were more blank pages stop moaning ed part five the controls the mousepoint and click the mouse lure of the temptress is entirely mouse controlled on mouse with three buttons the middle one is as much use as lead weight when you re drowning so forget it exists and concentrate soley on the left and right buttons point and click pointing and clicking is easypeasy and you must be an atari user if you think it how the fonz gets his birds you point the onscreen pointer to the part of the screen you wish to interact with and then you click one of the two buttons from now on ll be calling the left button button and the right button how to control diermot diermot can do many things all you need to know is that the onscreen pointer your direct link with the lure of the temptress world changes into different shapes at different times and allows you to perform different actions page seventeen movement first of all you will want to make diermot move about in his enviroment and it could nt be easier the mouse pointer is generally shown on screen as little white arrow point this to the location you wish to more diermot to click button and he will walk there do nt worry if there are any objects in his path he is clever enough to go around them if there is an exit available from the screen you re on and you point to it the the small white pointer will change into large white arrow you ca nt miss it it big and indicates the direction in which you ll be travelling click as bove using button and diermot will walk to the next screen page eighteen drink examine look or status this is menu which you can bring up at any time during the game simply by moving your pointer anywhere on the screen but not on charater or an object and pressing button if you decide you do nt want this menu after all then simply press button again and the menu will dissapearif you do wish to use this option then highlight the option you want and click button the options you can choose are as follows drink this allows diermot to drinkwater potions or whatever when button is clicked on drink diermot will take swig of whatever liquid he is carrying if diermot has more than one drinkable liquid on his person you will be given the option th scroll through them by pushing the mouse backwards or forewordsone item will be highlighted at time click on the item you require using button and diermot will take swig examine click button on this option and list of everthing that diermot is carrying will appear scroll through large list using the mouse as above click button on the object of your desire and hey presto description will appear look selecting this button will give you text description on diermots location it not unusual to be loved by anyone quit clowning ed for location description to include hint of some sort so use this option fairly regulary if was me status click on this with button and you ll be given an information screen which tells you with no scrolling of all the objects diermot is carrying about his person including money please note at the beginning of the game when you do not possess and drinks or carry any objects only look and status will be available to you page nineteen look at an object or character if you move the pointer over person or certain object then the pointer will turn into small crosshair this means you can look at whatever is highlighted be it human vegatable or mineralso click button and diermot will walk to and examine the object in question clicking button again clears the text window containing the description of the object manipulating objects it often the case that diermot is able to manipulate an object as well as look at it while the crosshair is positioned over an object click button and menu should appear move the mouse up and down to scroll through the list of available commands then select button to select the required action button on the other hand will cancel the menu box and return you to the main screen page twenty looking through windows it worth mentioning that if you want to look through crack or window you treat it as if you are manipulating an object once your crosshair appears click button and you will be offered the option to look through the crack or look through the window press button to select this action or button to cancel by the way you ca nt interact with people or objects you see in this modeall you can do is observe and pressing either botton will take you back to your actual location talking to people talking to other characters in lure of the temptress works in similar way to interacting with the objects move the pointer over character and the pointer will change into the crosshair sight at the same time in the left hand corner of the screen the characters nameor their descriptionwill appear clicking button will make diermot examine the character but to talk to them click button instead talk menu will appear allowing you to converse with the character ask them for something give them something or in some cases tell them to do somethingto issue commands when characters are engaged in conversation whether with you me or each other theyll have small word balloon above their heads so you ll know page twentyone conversing in general better explain little further about the actual conversing because hope it something you ll be doing lot of in this adventure having selected the character you wish to interact with you then select talk to from the talk menu mentioned earlier one of two things will happen conversation will unfold in front of your eyes contained within dialogue boxes if you ve read what been said by one character and you want to advance the conversation then position you pointer over the name at the top of the dialogue box and press either button if you do nothing at all then the conversation will advance automatically after short period of time anyway when talking to certain characters you may be given choice of questions or statementsthe relevant lines of text will appear at the top of the screen after deciding what you are going to say and do be careful move the pointer to the line you have chosen and click button you will immediately get response from the other party and may be given another list of questions or statements do the same again and again until the conversation is terminated if you decide that you do not want to continue the conversation at any time then click button bthe talk option will be cancelled and you will be returned to the main game window recommend that you save your position before you enter in conversation with the more unsavoury characters page twentytwo issuing commands if you re talking to certain characters in the game you ll notice that the talk menu contains not just the give ask and talk to commands but also the tell command by using this tell command you can get character to do exactly as you want you can command me ratpouch for oneso here how to make me do things having clicked on me and selected tell in the talk menu with button the beginning of sentence appears at the top of the screen it says tell ratpouch to but to what tell me to what okay so you ll notice that new menu has opened up containing list of verbs which you can scroll through by moving the mouse back and forth find one that you like the look of and highlight it and press button let say you picked go to so now the example reads tell ratpouch to go to and now the menu has changed to list of locations how about the sewer outlet okay highlight it and click button tell ratpouch to go to the sewer outlet and back comes the verb menu highlight get menu of gettable items appears choose sewerage the verb menu reappears choose drink drinkable menu appears choose sewerage then choose return your command now reads tell ratpouch to go to the sewer outlet and then get sewerage and then drink sewerage and then return if you want me to carry out the order highlight the word finish click button and off ill trot to do your bidding if you do not like the choice of options that you have set up use button which upon each click will backspace through the commands allowing you to make corrections use of the tell command you will discover some very sophisticated effects using the tell command and you can save yourself some time to bootby getting someone like me to to do things for you occasionally you may actually need to use the tell command for example when diermot is unable to carry out an action himself at other times the tell command is necessary because although diermot is capable of doing something he really ought to be somewhere else doing something else page twentyfour giving and taking if you click button on give in the talk menu it will be assumed that you want to give something to the character you have selected and menu containing your inventory will be shown scroll through if necessary and highlight the object you wish to get rid of by clicking with button again if the person that you are trying to give the item to wants it then they will take it if not they wo nt it the same process for taking an object from person once you ve selected character highlight ask in the talk menu and then menu of things you have seen or heard about will appear click on the object you require with button and if the person you ask has the object and wants to give it to you then they will if they do nt they wo nt page twentyfive mortal combat as soon as combat situation is entered the pointer system will change the pointer is now displayed as an advance arrow retreat arrow or an axe icon it all depends on the positioning of the mouse let do walk through advance arrow if the pointer is in front of diermots body you ll get this the advance arrow it still works in the same way as the pointer insofar as you need to press button to make diermot move he ll advance retreat arrow it obviously the exact opposite of the advance arrow if the pointer is behind diermot and button is pressed then he will retreat the axe icon this is trickier because the icon appears in three different locations depending on the position of the pointer to get the axe icon at all the pointer has to be over or very near diermot body if the pointer is near diermot head you ll get the axe icon in high position if the pointer is at diermot waist level you ll get an axe icon in central position while if you drag the mouse down towards diermot feet you ll get the axe in low position these three positions are both attack and defend positions here how to use them whether diermot will attack or defend depends entirely on which button is pressed and which button you press depends on what side diermot is being attacked from the attack button is the button nearest your enemy the defend button is the button furthest from your enemy two minor icons explained in case you wet your pants so as not to worry you you should know that an icon of movie camera will appear as the machine gets ready to do graphic sequence also when you have clicked for diermot to move somewhere clock icon will appear as the computer thinks out his route page twenty seven saving and loading your game first you ll need to make data disc insert blank disc into the drive df0 and move your pointer to the top of the screen menu bar will appear point to file hold down button and select format disc then release the button press button to make data disc if you want to save your position select save game from the file menu release the button then select one of the nine save slots on your data disc when slot is empty the name of the slot appears in lower case and when used it will cahange to capitals to restore game follow the same procedure selecting the required saved position from the list of slots text speed nearly forgot if you want to change the speed at which the text is printed on screen simply select the help menu from the top of the screen two options are available slow text and fast text page twentynine part sevenquick start refereance when dealing with the menus the general rule to follow is that the left button acts as the selector while the right button acts as the deselector when the pointer is small arrow the mouse acts as follows left walk to the selected spot right drink examine look and list status inventory when the pointer is crosshair left examine object or character right interact with an object get pull etc interact with character talk to give tell etc page thirty what am meant to do it an adventure you ll find out as you go along for those who are not hardened veterans of adventure games there are few pages of hints to help you page thirtyone hints talk talk to everyone even boring characters may hold precious information but be careful what you say see enemies look some items are obvious some are not search your locations carefully peek peek through anything you find peekable it handy to find out things like what people are saying behind your back or who is or is not in room before you do something and if you have seen an object it will be added to your noun inventory you can then ask someone about it even though you have not been in it actual location bribe you can be bit liberal with your cash just before you ask them question but do nt be too liberal or youll have no cash to be liberal with help do nt be too proud to ask someone for help if you think you ca nt do something yourself then maybe you could talk someone into giving you hand or heaven forbid even doing it for you enemies if you re talking to someone and annoy them in some way it might not end there they may meet someone on their travels and relay the incident that diermot they might say there something fishy about him that sort of thing rumours and gossip can travel like wildfire and you ll be oblivious to it until it too late examine you ve got an object and ca nt work out what to do with it so examine it and do nt forget it not only the objects that you are carrying that can be examined page thirtysix xx another file downloaded from the nirvananet tm seven the temple
