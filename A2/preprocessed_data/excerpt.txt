relevant excerpt from the snarkout boys and the avocado of death by daniel manus pinkwater walter come see what ve got said my father what he had was an avocado whenever he brings one home which is fairly often he makes big fuss about it looky walter an avocado what do you think of it my father is the only person know who says looky he also says lookit what think of avocados is this on principle do not eat green slimy things my mother does nt eat them either she says she does nt like the taste of avocado that good enough for me if there any question at all about the taste leaving those suckers alone my father loves them every time he brings one home he acts like it threehundredpound sailfish he caught singlehanded or an elk he brought down with bow and arrow he really enthusiastic about avocados he skins them and digs out that oversized stupidlooking pit and then mashes up the slimy green part with fork then he puts lemon juice and vinegar salt and pepper and powdered garlic and paprika on it of you have to go to all that trouble to disguise the flavor why bother say then he makes speech about it my goodness this is one fine avocado he says you have to know how to choose them you have to look for the ones that are black and blasted looking the pretty green ones are nt fit to eat the funny thing is that they reduce the price of the really scrumptious ones just because they re ugly guess they want to sell them before they rot completely my father is nt bad guy in my opinion there are just few subjects like avocados on which he irrational my mother had found another tunacasserole recipe this is something of hobby with her she constantly finding these recipes in women magazines she tries another one at least once week they all taste like tuna fish usually the have things in them you would nt expect to eat with tuna fish like grapes hot pickle slices fried chinese noodles hope you will appreciate this kiddo my mother says seeing that your mother took healthy slice out of her finger whilst chopping up the ingredients she usually manages to injure herself at least once while preparing meal she has bandaid on her finger eat up champ she says it american my mother has an idea that tuna caught in japanese waters is tainted with radioactivity so she always shops for brands canned within the continental united states even canadian brands are out theyre too chummy with the commonists she says she calls communists commonists if you were blind or only knew my mother from talking with her on the telephone you probably think she was about six feet tall and maybe two hundred and fifty pounds in weight it her voice and the way she talks she sounds like she ought to be big slow moving person maybe little sloppy actually she small and nervous always well dressed and chain smoker once my father and have started eating our meal she brings little ashtray to the table and puffs cigarette between bites of food this is far more disgusting than avocado eating if can possibly get out of it try not to have meals with my parents ve complained to them about various nauseating things they do but it does nt do any good everybody has family my mother says do nt know what that means our apartment is new we are the first people ever to live in it when we first moved into the building it was nt quite finished the whole place smelled of paint and there was brown paper on the floors in the elevator and the hallways in those days we had to take our shoes off outside the the apartment door so we would nt track plaster dust onto the carpet come to think of it ve never walked on the floor in our living room there are those clear plastic runners my mother put down making kind of path through the living room to the dining alcove the furniture has plastic covers too my mother says that when you decorate with light colors you have to be careful nobody ever sits in the living room except when my parents have company and then it has to be company wearing suits and ties and fancy dresses when they expect company like that my father puts on suit and tie and my mother puts on fancy dress and rolls up the plastic runners and the all sit in the living room
