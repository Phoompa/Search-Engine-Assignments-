the ant and the cricket once upon time one hot summer cricket sang cheerfully on the branch of tree while down below long line of ants struggled damely under the weight of their load of grains and between one song and the next the cricket spoke to the ants why are you working so hard come into the shade away from the sun and sing song with me but the tireless ants went on with the work we ca nt do that they said we must store away food for the winter when the weather cold and the ground white with snow there nothing to eat and we ll survive the winter only if the pantry is full there plenty of summer to come replied the cricket and lots of time to fill the pantry before winter rather sing how can anione work in this heat and sun and so all summer the cricket sang while the ants laboured but the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months autumn came the leaves began to fall and the cricket left the bare tree the grass too was turning thun and yellow one morning the cricket woke shivering with cold an early frost tinged the fields with white and turned the last of the green leaves brown winter had come at last the cricket wandered feeding on the few dry stalks left on the hard frozen ground then the snow fell and she could find nothing at all to eat trembling and famished she thought sadly of the warmth and her summer songs one evening she saw speck of light in the distance and trampling through the thick snow made her way towards it open the door please open the door starving give me some food an ant leant out of the window who there who is it it me the cricket cold and hungry with no roof over my head the cricket ah yes remember you and what were you doing all summer while we were getting ready for winter me was singing and filling the whole earth and sky with my song singing eh said the ant well try dancing now
