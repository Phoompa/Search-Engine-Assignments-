lies wants it all momma fallen angel lose it all rolling the dice of her life fallen angel poison crystal leaned heavily against the open door to the refrigerator peering into the brightly lit interior wondering which bowlful of leftovers had the least chance of killing her she finally decided on the leftover pizza cheese and sausage and chocolate milk the carton was still half full she kicked the fridge door shut and stood in front of the oak wood cabinets debating on whether or not she needed plate shrugging she dismissed the idea elbowed the kitchen light off and headed for the dark living room she tripped over an amplifier that sat on the living room floor as she fumbled for the light switch finally the track lighting leapt to life and crystal eyeballed the room with grimace scores of sheet music littered the room some of it was wadded up into little balls some of it was crumpled but it was mainly strewn everywhere compact discs records and tapes were scattered over the top of the oak bar along with some halfempty glasses pens pencils an electric pencil sharpener set of headphones an amp hook up earrings dodgers baseball cap and bra phone numbers taped to the entertainment center added colorful clash to the pile of socks next to the large roland keyboard component unit that sat in the middle of the living room floor handheld synthesizer lay on the black sectional wires winding out into the unknown highheeled boots and pair of hightop gym shoes were scattered under the glass coffee table magazines occupied one black velour chair while newspapers occupied another gon na have to clean this place up sometime she thought to herself she tried to recall what the carpeting looked like and failed soon she said out loud to noone she elbowed the light switch again deciding to eat in her bedroom knowing for fact she had better chance of making it back out in one piece as the light clicked off enshrouding the mess in darkness she tripped towards the bedroom what difference she though as the bedroom lights came on can see the floor and feel the carpeting kingsize bed piled high with pillows sat against the far wall each pillow encased with either pink or black sham matched the large black and pink comforter on the bed heavy black curtains hung from the huge picture window two black dresses accented with silver and an ebony lounge chair took up the bulk of the room large hat stand holding an array of many different kinds of hats sat next to the open door to the walkin closet through another door crystal could see the pink tile of the bathroom floor glancing at the dresser top she tried to avert her eyes from the enormous pile of mail that had accumulated there frowning she put her milk down scooped up the mail and went over to her bed she grimaced at the slight pain in her chest ignoring it she flopped down and began reading through the mail as she munched her pizza it took while to make dent in all the bills junk mail fan letters invitations and catalogs when she was about halfway through the phone rang she glanced at the digital alarm clock on her nightstand next to the phone the time read 1223 am time means nothing to musicians she thought to herself reaching for the phone she again felt the pain why did she feel like she was forgetting something hello she said stating rather than asking crystal why in the hell have nt you called me back bellowed scratchy deep bronx accented voice on the other end crystal raised an eyebrow rip is that you she inquired who the hell else would it be he growled dunno maybe someone nice she said icily what is your problem anyway she could see the guitar player in her mind probably smoking cigarette and running his long fingers through his shoulderlength black hair rumor has it you re gon na start working at home rip voice dropped about 20 decibels and took on kinder tone the pain that bad crystal looked down at the halfeaten slice of pizza before she tossed it onto the nightstand and wiped her hands on her jeans what pain she forced her voice to remain calm she glanced at her dresser top again and saw the prescription bottle damn that what she forgot jack miller tells me you ve been having rough time at the studio the pain in crystal chest caused her to grit her teeth jack do nt know shit crystal look rip fine it was dull throbbing pain now and crystal made mental note to kick herself in the ass for not taking her pill have you thought of maybe taking some time off cancer is some pretty serious rip it not that bad bullshit and jack says you wo nt even

take break from the rat race for few rip music is my life she whispered as she looked at herself in the mirror on her dresser her hazel eyes brimming with unshed tears the pain in her chest intensified and she fought to keep her voice even ca nt give it up wo nt give it up she said harshly know his voice sounding shaky but you re going to die if you do nt try something going to die anyway single tear slid down her high cheek bones her shapely lips twisted into scowl going to go down fighting rip her voice edged with razors have an album to complete and only have 12 months to do it have come too far worked too hard to quit now she squeezed her eyes shut to block out the pain surging through her crystal there was pause crystal crystal opened her eyes the pain reaching new heights caused her to feel dizzy she staggered forward losing her balance she hit her temple on the corner of the dresser with sickening crack she crumpled black phone still in hand the black carpeting rising to meet her enfold her welcome her blackness and she knew no more tears of glass chapter 1992 kimberly ann carter exit light enter night take my hand off to nevernever land enter

could feel scorching hot fluid overflow down her cheeks her insides shriveling as the liquid made contact with her internal organs she could see her skin blackening cracking under the intense heat hair singed down to the very roots body engulfed in flames melting melting crystal slowly opened her eyes to find michel standing over her she looked down to see she had her nails dug into his arm blood flowing from gash on his wrist spilling on the sheets spattering her hospital gown what the hell she thought pushing his arm away he smiled down on her laughter showing in his evergreen eyes so much blood she whispered as she ran her tongue around the inside of her mouth where coppery salty taste still remained she felt so weak so tired her eyes drooped sleep well love she heard his french accent soothing her for you have quite journey ahead she felt his lips brush hers and then once again the soothing dark enveloped her crystal sat straight up in bed god what nightmare she thought and then reality hit her she was in hospital her hand flew to her forehead where gauze bandage was taped the material felt funny under her fingers well at least the pain in my chest is gone she thought as she threw back the covers she looked down at her arm where an iv ran to bottle on stand enough of this shit she thought as she ripped the iv from her hand she was hungry and wanted real meal by god the thought of steak dinner crossed her mind and she smiled nice and rare she thought as she climbed out of bed two doctors and nurse burst into the room and where do you think you re going questioned one of the doctors he was young handsome and out of breath miss dawn please get back in bed said the older doctor firmly he had beefy hand on crystal arm and she noticed he was balding something sure smells good she thought wonder what they re cooking in the cafeteria look doll feel fine got terrific hunger pang though she said removing the bandage on her head miss dawn you have been through terrible ordeal since you were admitted two nights ago began the young doctor two nights ago jesus christ that how long ve been out not only out but you flatlined once during that period we had done everything we could to think of to save you but nothing worked at least at first he shifted uncomfortably you should consider yourself lucky to be alive young lady nodded the old doctor crystal mind flashed to michel am do but feel great have nt felt this good in ages the nurse adjusted the pillows that fine but you need to rest need dinner crystal growled all right ll send dinner up to you if you promise to get back into bed pushed the young doctor but now nurse crawford stay with her till get back the young doctor turned to his elder this is the damnedest thing thier voices became unintelligible outside the room door crystal inhaled deeply she could nt understand but something smelled good enough to eat crystal turned towards the nurse she could hear nurse crawford blood flowing through her her heart pumping blood let me get you another blanket out of the closet you feel kind of cold said the nurse as she opened the closet crystal could see her clothes hanging inside she looked down at her hospital gown and vision of it being blood spattered rose unbidden from her mind she frowned and shook her head she had to get out of here and fast screw dinner here she grab burger from mcdonald nurse hand me my clothes she demanded and began untying the gown miss dawn though we were through with that now get back in the bed crystal walked towards the closet want my clothes she said loudly no the doctor said fuck the doctor said want my clothes now crystal reached out to push the nurse away and realized what had smelled so good it was nurse crawford give me my clothes before you really piss me off crystal felt pricking sensation in her mouth her eyes flashed she was very angry and absolutely starving if you do nt get back in the bed calling the nurse did nt have chance to finish crystal grabbed her arms in crushing grip and sank her fangs into the nurse neck hey everyone this letter includes tears of glass chapter recently sent out message asking whether

think about the story tears of glass chapter 1992 kimberly ann carter and the walls came down all the way to hell never saw them where they standing never saw them when they fell tweeter and the monkey man the travelling wilburys crystal felt warm blood gush between her teeth tasted it coppery saltiness as soon as she swallowed her hunger and anger subsided nurse crawford jerked angrily away small bruise on her neck damn musicians she shouted as she backpeddled towards the door keeping her eyes on crystal the entire time you rockers especially you re all weird she ran from the room what the hell is the matter with me crystal questioned as she pulled off the hospital gown ve been pissed off before but never angry enough to bite someone she pulled her blue jeans from the closet and put them on and whats really gross is it tasted good oh yuck ca nt believe thinking this way must be losing it she grabbed her boots and sat down on the bed as soon as she did she remembered the nightmare about michel his handsome face swam before her eyes damn him what happened to him crystal chewed her lower lip and pulled boot on that bastard she pulled on the other boot hard enough to hurt trust him tell him dying and what does the creep do up and leaves crystal stamped back to the closet put on her halfshirt and pulled her leather out gritting her teeth she struggled into her biker jacket mad at herself for dreaming about him shouldering her purse she peeked down the brightly lit hallway which just happened to be empty for the moment anyway quietly she let herself out walking on tip toes so her three inch heels would nt click she headed towards door marked stairs just thinkin screwy because of the lump on my noggin she reasoned as she rounded the landing to the fifth floor ca nt believe bit that nurse person would be thought crazy face was staring at her through the window of the 6th floor door large brown eyes pleaded with her hazel eyes while gentle rapping urged her to open the door she put her hand to the knob turned it and freed geek very tall geek in hospital gown with wild brown hair long fingers and norman bates smile great just great she thought maybe if ignore it it ll go away crystal walked around him and continued down the stairs and he followed she increased her pace bit and he matched it she remembered all the movies about raving lunatics she had seen over the last 10 years were nt they always kept on the fifth floor in the movies between the third and second floor crystal stopped so abruptly that he stepped on her with his bare feet something can help you with she asked coolly her hands crammed into the pockets of her leather well uh stammered the geek hi crystal rolled her eyes he really looked geeky the hospital gown was bit big in the sleeves it pooled around his hips and flared out at the knees with those big brown eyes he looks like holly hobbie reject crystal thought he smiled at her with that demonic grin holly hobbie with an axe my name is fred he offered and extended his hand crystal looked at his hand for second looked him in the eye and shook hands with him well at least his palm was nt sweaty crystal she said dryly crystal dawn where you going he questioned as he tilted his head to one side oh yeah screwball definitely crystal closed her eyes what person in their right frame of mind asks question like that home she replied taking another step down the stairs fred maneuvered in front of her where home crystal inhaled deeply and counted to 10 fred why do you care just curious oh he still blocked her path she cleared her throat he stood grinning down at down at her she stood staring at the wall after about minute crystal threw up her hands what do you want from me she blurted fred sighed want you to help me leave he said like she should have guessed me help you leave she shouted do nt yell you do nt know me from adam she whispered fiercely at him need to leave he said softly please crystal leaned on the banister she thought about nurse crawford and the doctors how they had tried to make her stay for all she knew they were starving him too all right he was nerd with real psychotic grin he was probably harmless her imagination probably was working overtime the fifth floor was probably private floor the chances of him being crazy seemed mighty slim after all this is reality shit like that only happens in the movies all right ll help you if can great he sounded relieved look wait here crystal headed down the stairs to the second floor ll see if can get you some clothes fred followed her to the door you will come back he began looking frightened yes ll come back she smiled at him promise promise fred she patted his arm slunk through the door and was gone after doing quick search of the floor crystal found the doctor personal lockers jimmied one open with nail file and pulled out street clothes wallet and some car keys she took all the cash out of the wallet except 20 he going to need cab fare she said aloud as she fingered the keys to his jeep she scanned through his wallet got his license plate number and returned the wallet she closed the locker softly and crept back down the hallway to the stairwell fred was nowhere to be seen fred she whispered loudly fred up here voice called from the landing above crystal climbed the stairs and found fred standing over the unconscious body of nurse what the hell crystal inquired with annoyance she was gon na yell so knocked her out here crystal threw the clothes to fred and turned her back the car keys felt cool in her hand you need ride somewhere that be great thanks so much fred yes crystal shut up fred and crystal found the jeep without trouble got in and drove out of the hospital piece of cake crystal stated was surprised we were nt questioned or stopped you want to tell me where im taking you fred stared off into space fred no response yo fred huh where am drivin you crystal smiled and shook her head was just remembering dream he told her fred do nt do you have dreams crystal gripped the steering wheel hard enough to make her knuckles white no she said forcefully do nt well do and just had dream about fred yes crystal shut up crystal what why were you in the hospital crystal was quiet for moment was visiting my sister she lied oh why were you in the hospital do nt know was fred reply you look familiar do uh huh wait do nt tell me ll guess fred said enthusiastically were you on wail from siren cut off fred sentence police car appeared in crystal rearview mirror shit crystals foot hit the gas and the jeep shot forward they headed south on lake shore drive navy pier short ways in the distance for the time of night there was little traffic and crystal foot got ten pounds heavier fred held on for his life what are we going to do he yelled over the siren crystal looked around quickly she could see lot of people milling around navy pier where huge boat had been docked it seemed to be an old pirate ship of sorts she checked her rearview mirror again they were gaining fred do you see all the people at the pier yeah do you think we could lose the cops in crowd do nt know it works on tv crystal rolled her eyes going to stop the car and when do get out and run for the crowd got it fred glanced back over his shoulder looked at crystal and nodded all right hang on crystal pushed the pedal to the floor and fred braced himself as soon as she gained some ground she threw the jeep in park dropping the transmission in the middle of lake shore drive gears ground and metal screamed but the jeep stopped crystal and fred jumped from the jeep and began running towards the pier crystal heard the screech of tires and looked back they were heading towards the pier as well she noticed that the crowd was here to see the boat so she bought two tickets and grabbing fred headed towards the ship we ve got to lose them she said in his ear crystal looked around nervously fred grabbed her hand and said look there hole huh crystal looked apparently the ship had been sunk or had been grounded because there was large hole towards the back of the boat he led her to it and peered into the darkness we could hide in there he said pointing at it crystal wrinkled her nose as she eyed the splintered wood do nt know fred if they find us they re going to find us for sure if we do nt do something it dark in there do nt worry crystal it ll be okay fred stepped over the rope guard crystal followed more slowly the hole looked like big gaping mouth with lots of sharp teeth crystal took deep breath and while holding onto freds hand tightly she stepped into the hole her hair standing on end this has not been my night crystal murmured under her breath and the night still young what did you say asked fred out loud his voice bounced off the old wood giving the sentence slight echo nothing hey there are stairs he told her really crystal thought where her eyes still hadnt adjusted to the inky blackness yet board creaked behind them and crystal froze she clamped her free hand over fred mouth shhhh she hissed they stood for what seemed like hours but no other sounds gave away location of possible pursuer fred led crystal down the stairs to door warped and badly in need of repair does nt look like anyone been down here in while fred commented and gave the door push stale air and the smell of decay got to love it crystal joked fred turned to look at her you are sick am not was just trying to be funny you failed oh fred stepped into the small room and immediately spied something in the corner hey do you see that he gestured no wait yeah what is it she asked as he moved towards it it looks like body crystal was glad it was dark and was thankful fred had his back to her body is that all boring we should leave she took step back scared who me yeah no it dead you know it ca nt hurt you crystal smiled weakly okay help me move it it stuck crystal blanched okay she numbly walked over to where fred was standing with poker grin plastered to her face here you take his head fred motioned with his hand right crystal leaned down as she placed one hand on the ship wall for balance she cut her hand on the splintering wood ouch now what cut myself she grabbed her hand and squeezed she was bleeding she could feel it run down her hand off her fingers to splash onto the face of the raving maniac who jumped up ran to the doorway and proceeded to rip the throat out of person standing there blood spurted everywhere and as the young teenager who fred thought was body began to drink the blood out of the throat of his victim crystal fell to her knees this is another bad dream it has to be shit like this does nt happen she looked at fred who was throwing up in corner after what seemed like small eternity the young man dropped the body and turned towards crystal and fred his fangs glistening with blood
