four moons of death ding dong the melancholy tintinabulation of the iron bells echoed in the golden town of arno the shuffling of feet filing out of granite cathedral and the murmuring voices of paupers dominated all the sound residing peacefully at it zenith in it aquamarine abode was the ocher sun slight breeze whipped up some dead leaves from the tan soil revealing some rustling slender and have brown hair man dressed in white robe with some golden lace entered al pub as he entered the bar tattooed bearded deepvoiced men sat at tables discussing about their adventures and their treasures while slurping various alcoholic beverages greetings came from every person as the arch bishop sauntered towards an empty table he received all sorts of messages like good afternoon fleric how are thee today absolutely believe in all thy sermons al paced up to the waxed oak table as fleric stood his wooden cudgel next to his wornout stool what will it be fleric shalt have some boar meat and cup of thy finest wine very good selection thy cost will be 5000 copper pieces fleric willfully fleric placed platinum coins engraved with the quote in annisette we trust on the polished table al gratefully grinned as he scooped up the money and briskly walkedoff jingling them in his enclosed hands fleric slipped small ancient tome from his robe long sleeve he flipped the yellow pages to the chapter on the moons fleric eyes caught something that made his gray matter go to work the inscription on the crinkled paper read when the moons are full it shall raise the deceased if thou even look at any grave during that period thou shalt meet thy untimely demise his almost hollow jaw drooped tonight is the night when all moons are full fleric thought must warn everyone his thin arm motioned at brown haired woman who held mahogany lute her cotton clothes seemed oversized and red silk hat topped her scalp why hello fleric what do thou want with wandering minstreal like me surely thou must have better things to do than talking to peasent like me warn everyone that tonight all moons are full that is all want from thee madame suddenly time stood still as all the gossiping and shouting terminated surprised eyes fixed themselves at fleric without hesitating all the customers fled the vicinity whispering to each other do not think that will be necessary fleric everyone else should know it by now the woman replies with that she walks up to al and started strumming on her lute song of praise to the goddess annisette heaving great sigh fleric continued to peruse the tiny book for thou to understand more thou must understand how the moons behave flit pop and lag go from east to west but instanity flies across the sky the other way flit is fast and lag is slow in it orbit pop is the strangest of all the moons it can appear any time and anywhere at night because of these behaviors the gravity of the moons mix itself with the radiation from the sun creating dark rainbow this unseen matter stimulates evil and will raise the dead al stout and jolly body loomed over fleric as some food was situated beside the arch bishop fleric lunch smelled good the odor grabbed fleric bony hand and dragged it towards the cup of brandy still staring at the book fleric drew the wine closer to him his hazel eyes lifted from the book and rolled back as he gulped down the drink when he quenched his thirst he put the bronze goblet back on the table and slammed the book shut warrior embodied by plate armour sat on the flimsy stool on the opposite side of the 4legged wooden platform snap the stool crumpled into countless splinters thud the fighter collapsed on to the dirt floor help me up fleric pleaded the myrmidon his outstretched arm beckoned fleric who was starting to nibble on his boar meat to lift him up the arch bishop threw down the slab of meat and yanked the man off of the floor with greasy hands thank you fleric do not mention it boris guess what what we have mission to fulfill we yes we must rescue children who wandered off towards the graves of the ones beyond the duke is willing to give us 5000000 copper pieces look fleric we will split it 5050 okay fine yawned fleric do not be so blase about it besides am looking to buy some armour particularly set of mythril armour could use some light weight armour and it does cost 25000 gold which means will be spending all of my reward money after all want the armour to match the color of my sword xcalibur boris drew blue bladed double edged sword from its sheath the saber glowed with an ultramarine aura will be back get ready though fleric bolted out of the bar without even getting tooth mark on the rest of his lunch what about thy lunch am not very hungry you eat it called fleric dashing towards his lodge far from the slums fleric knew he must hurry for the sun is about halfway covered by the horizon as he ran into the house he hung his white robe on steel rack by the foyer the arch bishop rushed into the armoury after flipping through his suits cloaks capes and various pieces of chain mail he grabbed set of extremely oversized dragonhide armour the cleric then fumbled with attaching his burntsienna leather pouch on his zinc belt on the armour with hands fleric snapped mythril plate on his left gauntlet his right thumb and index finger grasped crystal shillelagh with everything all set fleric tried to promenade as swiftly as possible back to the pub the aureate hemisphere lingered over the naked swarm of maple and redwood trees his footsteps became farther apart as flit one of the moons became palpable to the eyesight at the bar boris jingled sac full of exotic elixers while gazing out the window his eyes almost were shut and his chin rested safely on his hand boris eyelids popped open when his auditory nerves received the words ready now aaaaah you visited the apothecary boris stated fleric the fighter head nodded and with the cleric they treaded over the leaf infested ground toward the graves of the ones beyond the pair of warriors weaved pass the myriad of marble tombstones as shrills of child laughter echoed from the direction of garlock charnel house instinctively they tracked the noise with their weapons drawn then fleric and boris saw it all five children were sitting indianstyle on the granite roof of the crypt their tiny fingers flicked strange color disks into clay bowls on the other side of the stone slab hey it is ffleric stammered the smallest girl with rosy cheeks and blonde curls good afi mean evening children what are thou doing way out here this is the best place for tiddlywinks right tricia exclaimed the overweight boy yes it is bubba where else can we find flat surface as smooth as this replied the older girl come on children we need to go home now commanded boris no will not go exclaimed the youngest boy with red hair yes thou are boris flexed his huge biceps and lifted the boy off the marble roof with his left hand with the other hand he tapped flerics shoulder with the hilt of xcalibur the arch bishop turned around to see the ebony blade pointing at of moons flit lag and insanity glared with bright light as though they were stars fleric nodded and led the parade of children towards arno hooooooowllllllll the howl of distant wolf can be heard through out the planet as pop the 4th moon appeared out of oblivion creating the dark rainbow little did any know that the soil softly broke apart in nearby grave ahead of the party skeleton crimson hand poked out from the earth and grappled fleric leg as they walked by thump fleric plunged to the ground full of shock as to what had hit him fleric recovered from the fall and dusted off his soiled armour the whole grisly skeleton began ascending from it grave revealing half of its cranium sliced off eeeeeeeeeeeeeek cried all children in unison who huddled behind boris fleric steel boots smacked the skeleton ribs as it attempted to strangle the cleric the half rotted body disintegrated more corpses began climbing out of their resting places as zombies ghouls skeletons and wights without sound attacked the heroes even ghosts specters and banshees rose out of their graves even inorganic material began creeping towards the party every swish from boris xcalibur decapitated at least one of the undead cutting down their numbers fleric diamond shillelagh granulated every atom of each spirit flapping it hairy wings small mammal hovered around nicky the redhaired boy an emerald mist was dispensed from the animal transforming it into dark being with jetblack cape the pearly white fangs approahed nicky throat closer and nearer it came nicky tried to scream for assistence yet the shock petrified every muscle in the little boy body this event was observed by fleric just as gargoyle threw buffet right into the arch bishop intestines wincing in extreme pain fleric reeled back and toppled onto the grass at this point in the battle he saw this gruesome assault and dealt the neckbiter with white bulb used as projectile this seasoning landed right into the mouth of the creature with puff of bluegreen smoke the attacker decimated leaving very terrified nicky behind severed wrinkled scarred body parts flew everywhere as more monsters silently climbed out of their coffins the marble gargoyle that struck fleric earlier slashed its corundum claws at boris wooden shield the small plate easily crumpled under the relentless attacks from the living statue xcalibur suddenly radiated with an azure blue light as boris channeled his anger into the mystical sword with this sudden power the myrmidon butchered the stone giant the number one appeared in fleric mind he knew it was cue sent by the goddess annisette who heard their pleas for help death was certainly reality if he goes through this plan he must help his friends reeshceno the cleric chanted the magical incantation summoned jigavolt trail of electricity from the cosmos the bolt fanned out vaporizing all the undead in instant the strain of this spell was way too much for any mere mortals endurance to withstand heaving the greatest sigh in his entire existence as sentient on this planet caused fleric to crumple on grassy hillock every bit of undead organic debris slowly faded away until this cemetary looked as if nothing ever occurred all the children hovered over the limp body of fleric they slapped him screamed and even dumped water on his face his body still mimicked corpse bruno took blistered fingers and felt the arch bishop neck his pulse is still there the pulse somewhat slowed down dramatically he thought cool steady gust of wind ceased to blow the red orange yellow and brown leaves around for awhile it was dead silence kaboooom celestial lump of rock plummeted through the atmosphere smashing in the planet the force of such jolt shattered the granite roof of garlock mausoleum ha ha ha ha ha ha chuckled mysterious voice the chill of such voice sent shivers down everyone spines an iron guantlet pulverized the bolted steel door it can not be boris muttered the younger girl stammered it is ggarlock half decomposed wool cloak engulfed the metal covered body as it stepped out of it charnel house yes am alive once again bellowed the dark warrior thou are not going to be much longer as long as am here boris answered thou are such fool surely thou must know that am omnipotent nothing can stop me weapons can never penetrate my eclipse armour at garlock words boris thrusted the ebony sowrd into his adversary the dark warrior was nt even slightly incapacitated ha ha even xcalibur can not damage someone who can become intangible at will thanks to my armour if we had the right potion maybe we can awake fleric thought jeff the biggest boy bruno we need heal flask the fighter nodded while nimbly dodging boneshattering jabs and uppercuts as his hand reached into his bag his hand completely smothered an elixer covered with rough surface jeff boldy ran up to boris to receive the flask he tossed it to bubba who quickly dumped the purple liquid into fleric mouth garlock raised his gloved hand and lump of soil popped up slipping boris the fingers of garlock locked together as he pounded at boris the myrmidon rolled awat as the dark warrior fist missed and penetrated feet of rocky soil thou are such feisty little fool shalt personally end thy pathetic existence bruno managed to stand up his plate armour gashed dented scraped and cracked crumpled leaving studded leather suit zap two projections of electrically charged photons flew at boris whack whack like baseball player the game does not exist yet boris swung xcalibur at the blasts they dissapated at the contact with the ebony blade fleric eyes flashed open as he saw boris reeling back and crashing into marble statue of headless angel actually it wasnt headless before he awake cried the girls garlock featureless titanium mask faced the cleric two crimson glows on the mask glared fleric so the arch bishop is here even your powers can not stop me the moons give me power beyond your comprehension taste the fury of fire gigantic ball of flames rushed towards fleric lifting his mythril shield the blaze rebounded back at the dark warrior this was such surprise garlock never decreased the density of his molecules aaaaaarh you shall pay for this outrage cursed garlock who right now was torched your the one who is going to visit apollyn forever will return you can count on it will be ba boris consciousness flowed back into his brain as his sweaty biceps glistened in the moonlight where garlock cremated really yes annisette goddess and well revered intentionally smashed moons flit and insanity the vacuum of space muffled all trace of the collision now all scholars and astronomers wondered what fate did the two moons face the party marched back to arno as the sad ringing and the chiming of the iron bells reverberated in the darkness of the world
