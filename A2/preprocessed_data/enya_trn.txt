232657 gmt lines 762 well since my offer of this list of translations ve gotten several requests so decided to just post it and save everyone including myself lots of time so without further ado present the list of enya translations it was originally posted by lyle corbin nabeel ibrahim you asked this common question at just the right time since was just ready to post this to usenet please send me comments etc lylec microsoftcom english translations of the celts watermark and shepherd moons the following is compilation of translations taken primarily from usenet postings in the cases where multiple translations existed tried to pick the phrases that made the most english sense and which flowed together the best the choice was often arbitrary and not being speaker of irish or gaelic latin or welsh was not able to make my own judgements regarding the accuracy of translation your comments suggestions and corrections are welcome some of the songs have the lyrics compacted where repeated phrases are only listed once there are several songs such as ebudae where when listening to the song it sounds like lyrics beyond what printed are being sung if anyone is willing to transcribe any such lyrics and possibly translate then send them to me for inclusion into this document please be sure to send me both the original language text with accents fada as appropriate and the translation if you do information telling me that there is nothing there to translate would be useful too finally if anyone has editions of songs which were released on singles only ie not translated here then feel free to send me transcriptions and translations for those as well enjoy lylec microsoftcom ps if you happen to read this using proportional font the accents will not appear correct use fixed font instead the celts the text for this album was taken from the liner on japanese release by jagg groeg crow mundilcsmuozau translations for these songs were provided by fidelma mcginn thanks the mystical incantations throughout the songs were not translated as they have no english equivalent the celts hiri hiro hiri hoireann is ha hi ra ha ra ho ra hoireann is ha hi ra ha ra

those men from the sun signs from the heavens say am the one chorus now know can see your light this light that must follow you you could take my life away so far away now know must leave your spell want tomorrow the above lyrics for the chorus are taken from those printed in the sleeve of the japanese pressing by jimco records following are the words which are almost undoubtably those actually

haireann is ho ho ro ho notes samhna is version of samhan which is the name given to the first day of november this day was very large feast in pagan esp celtic tradition indeed the irish word for november is samhain it was one of the most important festivals of the year oiche samhna is the irish for halloween aidan hollinshead triad st patrick lyrics traditional translation give me your love the true son of god give me strength the clear bright sun repeat dan dwr this is the welsh language spoken in wales in the british isles any welsh speakers out there willing to provide translation dan dwr taweluck sydd dan dwr galwaf nid yw cum gyda fi dan dwr taweluch am byth dan dwr galwaf nid yw swm ddim fwy gyda fi watermark cursum perficio cursum perficio complete my journey or my path verbum sapienti the word of the wise quo plus habent the more they have of it eo plus cupiunt the more they want it post nubila phoebus after the clouds phoebus the god sun iternum notes my guess is that the thing they want in the 3rd and 4th lines is in fact the word of the wise mentioned in the 2nd line which by the way would also be in the correct case of the declination phoebus was one of the names for the sun god which may be more famous as apollo greek it is notable that the sun is male the word iternum does not exist it could either be misspelling for eternum eternal which is unlikely since it is very rare that an adjective be used as an adverb or for iterum again and again which is in fact an adverb and makes little more sense finally the meaning of cursum perficio is actually best explained by the footnote to the lyrics enya was inspired by these words she saw on marylin monroe last house where they were taken to mean my journey ends here it is rather free translation but it probably very good way to convey the meaning of latin which has way of saying things that is very distant from modernday english the fact that those words turned out to be prophetical only adds to the power of the song translation by mauro cicognini gin001 cdc835cdcpolimiit storms in africa ca fhad how far is it from siul trid na stoirmeacha walk through the storms dul trid na stoirmeacha going

curtis posted by kirsten morganucsmunca dennis foley dfoley bbncom shepherd moons comments on the inspiration and meaning of these songs can be found in the sheet music for this album these comments are available as the enya papers 22 how can keep from singing verse is missing from the printed words on how can keep from singing the lyrics are all correct except after the second verse through all the tumult and the strife add this verse while though the tempest loudly roars hear the truth it liveth and though the darkness round me close songs in the night it giveth no storm can shake my inmost calm while to that rock clinging since love is lord of heaven and earth how can keep from singing transcription by jagg groeg crow mundilcsmuozau but you can get the words just by listening carefully note there are several words that are bit difficult to determine exactly what they are but jagg points out and agree that of the possibilities the ones here make the most sense lyle ebudae amharc mna ag obair la mall san oich look women working by day and late at night ceolann siad ar laetha geal bhi they sing of bright days that were bealach fada anonn anall choich long way back and forth forever translation by dr stenson posted by david saranen saranen uxacsumnedu notes ebudae is term that deals with sounds the last line seems to contain misprint since the phrase is definitely anonn is anall not annon aidan hollinshead book of days oiche go hoiche mo thuras from night to night my journey an bealach fada romham the long pilgrimage before me la go la mo thuras from day to day my journey na

brings together far and away this day brings together far and away far and away posted by martin falatic falatic mentorccpurdueedu and possibly others notes this version was produced for and released with the soundtrack for the movie far and away starring tom cruise nicole kidman this version of the song has been released in place of the original version in recent pressings of shepherd moons afer

mememto terrigena remember life is earthborn 13 mememto vita brevis remember life is brief meus mihi suus cuique carus mine to me its own to each is dear notes proper names guessing umbriel ariel io vela this is tough itur is poetic form apparently the phrase may mean without end or eternal larry et itur ad astra means and we go to the stars there is no way of putting into english the impersonal meaning of itur which is actually the third person singular of the passive indicative present tense sorry but do not really know how english scholars refer to tenses hope its clear enough of the verb ire which means to go since to go can not possibly be passive am gone the passive mode is taken to sound as done by everybody and nobody in particular at the same time really like something that gets done but without specifying by whom mauro this phrase has been bothering me for some time was sure seen it or something like it before eventually found it there is phrase in virgil aeniad which reads sic itur ad astra which the translator noted as having the literal meaning thus you shall go to the stars but the poetic metaphorical meaning thus is immortality gained so substituting et and also for sic thus therefore the translation might read along the lines of and you shall go to the stars or perhaps and you shall live forever unknown vela refers to boat sail it may well be proper name though mauro mirabilia neuter plural means literally marvellous things translated as the singular and differently english likes to vary sempervirent evergreen do nt know how to translate rosetum proper name or rose garden which seems unlikely zephyrus is warm west wind volturnus is river in campania according to cassell latin dictionary do nt understand the reference africus is the southwest stormrain wind 10 the etesians are winds that blow 40 days each year around the dog days etesiarum is general term for swirling winds tease ing each other eurus is the east wind hence europe note in carribean blue the wind boreas is mentioned it refers to the north wind hence the aurora borealis graham 11 eurus is the southeast wind 12 this is almost impossible to translate into english without doing damage to word order mine is dear to me itshisher own is dear to each 13 terrigena is literally earthborn creature formed from the word for land terra and race or kind genus graham it is apparent that most of enya latin lyrics have been influenced by virgil aeneid since many of her phrases are those used by virgil aidan notes without an author indicated are by larry jordan translation and notes by
