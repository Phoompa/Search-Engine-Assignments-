with wild happy waves as cruised down the sidewalks of south weener way avenue the wind and exhaust wiping in my face police officers of all ranks jumped up to attention when pulled my car up onto steps of the 87th precinct captain lardbucket was in state of apoplexy screaming at the top of his lungs to the various personnel who rushed about doing his bidding glad your here this is the evidence see what you think he threw me what appeared to be five pound bag of grade ground chuck extremely rare thats whats left of the victim he was identified by his girl as alex lyman needless to say the bag proceeded to make sickly splat louder than the remains of my lunch as it struck the floor recomposed myself and prepared to get down to business lardbucket decided to tell me the whole history so to could see how stupid this was lyman was local crew stud down at the old cesspool boathouse he had lot of potential to go places as long as he did nt blow it uh yea his only weaknesses were his love for art and chocolate yes he was chocoholic he would do anything to get his fix eat it smell it even shoot it up directly sick habit that many giveadamnericans had his evil habit shortly caused the rotting out of his teeth as he lost his self will and forgot to brush about week ago he was fitted with dentures false choppers everything went fine until this morning when he was forced to eat hard candy because of lack of choco on the market the official statement from his ex girl knew well but had nt seen much of lately kate was one minute he was sitting on his bike chomping away when next blewie his whole body was raining down on the hood of my volkswaggen rabbit whata mess still cant get all the blood stains out of my jeans can you help yea ll solve this one it sounds interesting but ll be needing some help my groups busy again lardbucket gave me special kay he was nt busy never was and anyway he always loved little bit of excitement as my second replacement bucket suggested guy named datta tej datta had heard of him he was smooth totally under control guy and street smart to boot met both out front special was looking jockular and ready datta was cool as ice chanting lines from the rolling stones tune satisfaction we hopped into the hearse and backed out into traffic people honking with crazed excitement upon seeing me on the trail of new mystery decided that the two best possibilities were the hard candy or dentures they were the only two things new to his character doing 150mph on 395 at approximately 525 we rocketed towards lymans apartment he lived in east bf better known as borelington suburb located across the poluteomac from the district of confusia the house was mess medals trophies and ads for ivy league schools such as princeton an area branch of the grand diesel institute of giveadamnerica were everywhere we spread out to rummage through the ruble looking for any clues that could lead us to an answer the answer came as piece of paper lying next to an old hershey kiss wrapper it was an ad for the rot em and drop em denture makers company known for it use of inferior materials not suprising since lyman habit would have used up most of his cash and re de was cheap cheap enough to take the poor suckers last dime and give him less than that back now the problem was to find the place since it was an underground establishment no problem can find it said datta knew he would come in handy after quick stop at the seven eleven for specials mid afternoon post lunch predinner snack we shot towards datta connection at the crossed sabres newspaper real rag nothing like the northern virginia sun or national enquirer now thats respectful journalism the place was crawling with reporters and worse still photographers with big lenses the kinda people that felt right at home with and as it seemed datta kind of people also we headed for the second floor in search of the person with the info but yes you could of guessed it gang of female admirers attacked us half way up the stairs finally had to drag datta from the crowd at gun point threatening to plug any dame that tried to stop us that did nt put me high on their list but at least we got on with this fool mission we found his contact hiding out in the paper political office she was tall with curly brown hair and smile that would have brought dead man to life hi tej what can do for you she chimed hi kathleen we need the location of an underground establishment and with your knowledge figured that you might have it here the name of the place with that he handed her the paper with the name of the dental works on it she set the compromising pictures she held in her hand down and examined the paper closely sure know where they are but it ll cost ya you know how it is if they ever found out who told you they kill me ok give her the money and get the info taking special with me downstairs to get some photo supplies need datta and special filed out the door and down the stairs reached into my pocket and forked out benjamin franklin and handed it to kathleen that ll be fine the place your looking for is on the corner of washedout boulevard and kirkwood road but do nt know how your going to get into that place securities very tight do nt worry about me doll it ll be piece of cake you do nt talk much but some how believe you bet you can handle your self pretty well if you have chance give me call sometime we ll do lunch smiled and headed on down the stairs to get tej and special so we could get over there and confront these bozo decided to call it day and get some rest before the big finale dropped everyone off and headed back to my penthouse suite got home to find bess sick with head ache just my luck the next step before my blessed relief was to get on the blower and call the people on my special support squad to let them know that would be needing their special abilities afterwards leaned back in my easy chair and thought over my present case and wondered if it was all worth it sure what the heck fame glory and lots of money would make any stupid shmuck agree that it was all worth it an that was me at first light gathered my men together out behind the flab slab gym was leaving special behind to guard the car and and be our back up in case they brought out the big guns in his place was bringing sasha ivanchocuv and steve veit couple of ace tunnelers at home in the sewers and lovin every minute of it so who are we after whats the case do get over time just shut up steve and ll give you the details kid asks to many damn questions sheesh ok the plan is this we re going to go in via the storm drain which runs right below the building there is man whole cover that leads right up into their underground garage from their we ll take out their security system and then go looking for evidence both tej and have our super automated doeverything camera so we ll be taking shots of whatever we find ok hmmmm think we had better think about this some but it perfect plan sasha it the best we ve got hmmm well theirs just no pleasing people these days with that the professionals went to work steve used an old pair of pliers to lift the lid off the sewer and in we went led by the faint beam of light coming from sahsha flashlight ahh just what love nice walk though sewer water that has detergents chemicals animal pollutants and other foreign items floating in it now thats the way to start day it took us only five minutes to reach the man hole into the building little muscle and we were inside ok you guys keep it quiet steve stay here and guard the exit we ll be right back from here it was up the stairs to the switch box room that contained the security box ok sasha take care of it blamm budda budda boom buzz crack as sasha whipped out his jennings pocket auto and let the whole mess have it well they ll never know we re here now what pro knowing that we would have little time before we were swamped with more corporate thugs than you could imagine we took off to do our thing and blow this popcicle stand before things got sticky waooga waooga waooga well maybe we had no time we took the next five flights of stairs in dead sprint and turned smack dab into what we were looking for the room was filled with billlleeons and billleeons of false teeth waiting to be put into the dentures that the many poor fogies and troubled people of the city needed tej went to work right away firing away with his camera and motor drive sounding more impressive than submachine gun decided to inspect box that appeared to contain the materials that were used in making the teeth high exp losives please keep out of the reach of children as snapped few pictures of my find every thing fell into place while at the same time everything else fell apart gang way incoming were the words tej yelled as about 15 guards opened up with their acme power guns doing their best to turn us into swiss cheese three against fifteen was not my idea of even odds which meant was going to have to do one of my amazing super good guy stunts if we were going to get out of this one alive as my partners blazed away with their guns drew my 50 caliber autopistol with butt kicking rounds and returned fire the enemy dropped back in abject terror as we pressed forward in our attempt to escape not being good with guns tej shot out the various inanimate objects that stood between us and freedom many of the enemy succumbing to his evil plan falling over in fit of uncontrollable laughter whata plan just like something would have come up with the light of day greeted us like flash bulb in the face as we dashed to the awaiting safety of our get away car it had all fit into place this case was more diabolical than thought proceeded to explain my solution to capt lardbucket my colleges standing to the side smiling knowing that was true genius first told the captain about the clues we had found and our little escapades to the secret establishment after developing the pictures that both tej and had snapped before the fire fight the real clincher clue became apparent the large warning that said explosives was in plain view this made us look at things little more closely where we found the words c5 burned into the box plastic explosives easy to get hold of at your local army base and it molds real easy it seems that the firm scientists had come up with way to semiharden the explosive so that it could be used to make the dentures they also knew that the people most likely to come to them were choco addicts so if the c5 did nt hold up it would nt matter since they would be to stoned to complain but what caused the explosion and the death of the victim elementary my dear lardbucket the hard candy lets not get fresh now ummm just pay attention continued to explain that they were making the dentures for the punishment of eating constant diet of chocolate they did nt expect shortage of the drug and the turning of it users to harder substance the cracking of the hard candy acted as sort of blasting cap on the modified c5 and there you have it blewie epilogue the police snapped right to it they called in the 101st airborne and stormed the place since most of those military types are real rough necks they brought in the heavy artillery the next thing you knew they were really airborne oh well they got the bad guys too to the amazement of everyone the victims exgirl friend kate joined the local chapter of chocoholics anonymous she to had become victim of this dreadful addiction as for me shot on back to the old ritzydo penthouse people waving wildly as drove by happy that had solved another one and had nt run over them in the process home to the awaiting arms of my beloved babe and that was heaven

meal ticket was coming from yes once again things were slow crime was down and it was all my fault just to good oh well at least know it the bigger the ego the better yea the afternoon sun filtered it way through the darkened room and onto the waterford crystal glass panes in my door the sun felt warm on my face easing me into deep sleep then the door to my apartment opened my full attention was suddenly focused on the girl standing in the doorway and the 90 decibel alarm horn going off above her head which of course promptly shot off the wall with my 50 cal auto pistol she walked towards me door closing behind her sat up and pulled on my shoulder holster knowing that new case had just walked in mister she said removing her sunglasses at the same time she was around fivefour dark hair with deep brown eyes that spoke of the orient looked her over trying to get first impression on what was on her mind besides little air she had slightly bored sarcastic look on her face please have seat said gesturing towards the couch she sat down and crossed her legs what can do for you miss hong kathy hong call me kiki phew glad we got that straight want to hire you to check out an establishment that ll be attending next year with that she told me the whole story she was going to attend brain cramming institution of higher lore this coming fall but there was problem she felt

wanted to come along maybe ll learn something she had said and what the hay bess was away and it always helps to have dame around just in case grabbed my jacket and fedora and we headed out the door she flipped butterfly knife the whole way to our next destination special kay showed up as we were leaving and offered to come along yea we could never be without special we hopped into my hearse and shot down the sidewalks to jr mags things on the far side of the county dingy little place nearly wallpapered in old yellowing paper thin books both me and special frequented the place and this is where we would find the three people who were needed for this sort of operation as we walked in the place went silent eyes bulging and tongues hanging the men we were looking for stood drooling at my client put the hormones on hold fellas know you all do nt get many females in here but this ones off limits she client ahh come on was the cry ignored their obscene requests and got down to business and told them what was up the leader of the group troy was master in the martial arts and was man good with gun and ginsu cutlery rich was the next one good at surveillance and capable of doing the dirty work necessary to achieve our goal he had worked for the federal badguy impounders so you knew he must be good last but not most was tony tony was computer hack with the ability to sniff out any dark depressing person within ten feet and blend in with the brothers as long as he kept raping they liked the case and were ready to take off whenever thats right we ll get the cretins because they wo nt be able to beat superior godlike being like myself why could bring the perpetrators here now but that would ruin the challenge uhm yea glad troy on our side then again we hopped into the hearse and headed for the highway picked up my mobile voice box and told captain lardbucket that was headin out of the city on mission and special was coming along as our official liaison he gave me 1000 reasons for not leaving the city on this fool mission all of which shrugged off as mere responsibility lardbucket wished me good luck and said he put out the word that it was safe to walk the sidewalks again with that hit my acme anticollision cruise control and cranked up inxs on the radio an hour later bryan adams victim of love was blaring out of my highly expensive stereo when noticed the flash of the old red and blue behind me dropped out of cruise control and pulled off to the side of the road was somewhere between south carolina and georgia and it looked pretty backwater to me

fine and 30 days in jail so what do you have to say for yourself uh oh this guy was serious first showed him my club card for the national antibadguy foundation showing me to be fellow upholder of the law no such luck he just leaned against my car looking us over and spitting large wads of skoal on my new paint job ok that was the last straw was on case and this guy was leaning on my car obstructing an honest city dick and his colleges from helping this young lady with her problem just because he did nt like tastyfreeze vanilla icecream unbelievable threw the hearse into four wheel drive and reverse and floored it backing right over the officers car into drive and floored again went back over his car and left him standing in the middle of the road as feathers floated out of the sky around him still to this day ca nt figure out where those feathers came from two days 10 mcdonalds and 20 restrooms later we pulled onto the campus of university california it was sprawling metropolis that just crawled with every sort of post pubescent teenager imaginable we got right down to business sent rich and tony down to the main building to start looking for clues that signaled foul or stinky play rich would grill or at least toast the president of the and tony would attack the campus computers the rest of us headed for the dorms we ask few questions and get few answers the dorms were unbelievable the scene resembled only what could be described as set for disaster movie we watched as people filtered in and out of the first floor windows using them like doors empty cans and bottles that were obviously not used to hold fruit punch lay strewn and stacked throughout our first encounter came with tall blond and over tanned youth who appeared to be cleaning his room with shovel and large can of lysol bulldozer would have been better special stepped forward and attempted to communicate with the youngster like totally 6754 and it like rad too dude dude do nt ever call me dude screamed special just as feared as the words flowed out of his mouth like an alien tongue realized that we were in the heart of surferskater territory the speech could be heard filtering out
