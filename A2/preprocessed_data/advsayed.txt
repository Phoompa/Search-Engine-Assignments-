merchants and host of guards set out on the journey young sayed was splendidly equipped and armed with sword spear bow and arrows it was long long way to the holy city of mecca they travelled over plains mountains and deserts it was on long stretch of desert that they were attacked by large band of robbersthe4y were caught unaware some tried to flee but sayed shouted flee where do you think you

the young man bravely faced the attacker and killed him with his sword soldier nearby shouted out what have you done you ve killed almansor this is the end let run men ran in all directions now practically alone sayed remembered the whistle round his neck if it really was magic it might be able to help him he put it to his lips and blew hard but nothing happened not so much as whisper of sound in the meantime the others had fled sayed was taken prisoner bound and led before sheik selim very powerful man the leader of several of the desert tribes and unfortunately the father of almansor the very man sayed had killed selim however was not an unjust man when he discovered that sayed had taken almansor life in fair fight he refused to allow hair of his head to be harmed indeed he set him free and entrusted the young man to some travellers about to leave for far off mecca the holy city sayed thus found himself once more on his travels however one night friends of the dead almansor captured him your master told you not to kill me cried the young man we re not going to kill you all we going to do is tie you up and leave you here in the desert thirst and the sun or the vultures or the jackals will do the rest they not us will kill you and laughing cruelly they rode away two whole days went by sayed was on the point of death baked by the sun and with no water when close by passed some travellers belonging to kalum the merchant they came to his aid and saved his life as he came back to his senses with the first sips of water sayed spoke may allah reward you sir for saving my life what is your name my name is kalum said the man but it wo nt be allah who will reward me you are going to do that yourself if had nt come along you would have been dead by now and you are going to work for me until you have repaid that debt what is your name sayed he answered well sayed get up and come with me the young man went along with kalum and on the way discovered that he was rich merchant from baghdad so that was the city in which he went to live at that time baghdad was ruled by the famous caliph harunelrascid wise valiant and loved by all kalum owned big bazaar in the city and it was there that sayed was put to work doing all the humble jobs one day veiled woman came to the bazaar sayed was amazed when she said to him you re sayed are nt you yes he replied

always watched them the winners received rich prizes the veiled woman had weapons armour and horses and she lent these to sayed he took part in the tournaments and always beat the others winning lots of prizes as well as caliph admiration sayed however never revealed his name but just mentioned that he was horseman from distant cairo now it so happens that the caliph harunelrascid liked to wander through the city at night disguised as beggar or merchant to hear what folk had to say about him not to spy on them but to try and put right any mistakes he might have made sometimes he was accompanied by his chief minister well one night as sayed was going home to kalum bazaar he heard shouts and the sounds of struggle four men had attacked to others in dark corner the brave young man immediately came to the rescue by killing two of the attackers and chasing the others away when it was all over the two victims thanked sayed and asked him brave youth what your name my name is sayed came the reply kalum the merchant shop assistant hmm said one of the two men ypu seem to be more of gentleman than shop assistant however take this ring as reward for what you did for me then the other man spoke and this bag of coins you ve saved my life and you deserve it goodbye and away they went sayed stood there with the ring and bag in his hand with these he could now find ship and go home next day he said to kalum leaving sha nt be working for you any longer and where are you going to asked kalum home answered sayed home but it costly journey and with the wages pay you sayed smiled your pay certainly would nt take me far but and he held out the bag but this money will farewell however wicked kalum was not to be defeated he told the police sayed had stolen bag of gold the young man was immediately arrested the chief of police asked him who gave you this money man never seen before was the honest reply sayed was judged thief and sentenced to deportation to thirsty island the home of the worst kind of criminals on the ship the young man thought to himself well left home two years ago proud rich and happy here am today twenty years old in the midst of these convicts condemned to live and die an innocent man in prison during the night there was terrible storm driven by the wind the ship was flung about by the waves until it crashed onto some hidden rocks only one man survived the disaster it was sayed at the mercy of the waters he groped for something to hold on to but nothing came within his grasp until he suddenly felt his fingers touch the whistle the fairy had given him desperately he blew it and dolphin surfaced beside him shaking its head as though to tell him to get onto its back sayed clambered up and there found safety he remembered the fairy had told him that when he was twenty years old the whistle would save his life the dolphin carried the young man within sight of land thanks friend called out sayed as he slid down from the creature and swam ashore what surprise awaited him there was military camp soldiers and war machines sayed was taken prisoner and brought before none other than harunelrascid himself the soldiers who had seized him said sire this man must be one of the convicts that survived the shipwreck is that so harunelrascid demanded gravely yes replied sayed did survive the shipwreck but not convict and he explained how he had been reported to the police because of the bag of gold it was given to me he went on by one of two men saved one night from being attacked by four robbers harunel rascid looked at the man sitting beside him and then said did the two men give you anything else yes they did this ring sayed replied showing the caliph the ring which he kept round his neck with the whistle harun rose to his feet and exclaimed young man the two men you helped were my chief minister and myself go free but first tell me your name sayed sire sayed echoed the chief minister there man here in the camp called benezar who is searching for his son sayed it my father cried the young man and it was his father they hugged each other in delight since justice must be done in the world evil kalum was
