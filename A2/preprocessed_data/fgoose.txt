list of father goose stories father goose there were three medieval kingdoms on the shores of lake there was an island in the middle of the lake which the kingdoms had been fighting over for years

redied themselves for the fight the first kingdom had 12 knights and each knight had squires all of whom were busily polishing armor brushing horses and cooking food the second kingdom had 20 knights and each knight had 10 squires everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle at the camp of the third kingdom there was only one knight with his one squire this squire took large pot and hung it from looped rope in tall tree he busied himself preparing the meal while the knight polished his own armor when the hour of battle came the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight this was too trivial matter for the knights to join in the battle raged and when the dust cleared the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom having defeated the squires from the other

through the uneventful bottom of the ninth youngster on the opposing team totally amazed to have seen such in the majors inquired of one of his fellows about the hulk up against the fence that the

the name by which he was known to his neighbors ran an oriental novelty store he stocked all of the standard far eastern trinkets such as paper kites shaped like fish cheap imitation silk kimonos japanese lanterns chopsticks and so on but both his heart and his profit were in his collection of wooden figurines fortunate contacts mostly relatives in taiwan had given him access to the finest woods of the orient and the most skilled carvers his greatest treasures were tiny statuettes no bigger than your thumb carved from teak wood these were totally unique to his establishment for he had cousin who owned the finest stand of teak trees in burma and his greatest secret distant relative by marriage was blind sculpter who specialized in carving these miniatures mr chan statues had made him rather well known among connoisseurs of oriental curiosities and provided him with comfortable living mr chan life had continued undisturbed for years and all seemed most serene every day he would come down from his bedroom above the shop unlock the door and wait for business he would sell few cheap knicknacks to tourists and perhaps once month buyer would arrive to look over his collection of statuettes such special customer would receive mr chan full attention and they would talk for hours about the finer points of oriental carving usually the visit would end with sale and mr chan would retire happily to his bed one day though disaster struck mr chan came downstairs and discovered that his store had been vandalized the door was ripped right off of its hinges and lay 20 feet down the street paper lanterns were ripped apart coolie hats smashed to straw and some fine delicate japanese screens were riddled with holes but worst of all the glass display case in which mr chan kept his figurines had been shattered and all of the figurines were stolen mr chan though momentarily shocked was made of stern stuff he called the police at once and consoled himself that wise businessman that he was he was fully insured while this was meager compensation for the loss of his beloved statues he hoped that the police would be able to recover them the police however despite painstaking search could discover but one clue tiny muddy childlike footprints leading from the door to the display case the police suspected youth gang but could find no further evidence mr chan was forced to disappoint several of his regular customers while waiting for the next shipment of statues from taiwan but they finally arrived and mr chan was very excited for these were even finer than any he had previously received he carefully arranged them in his display case he had of course replaced the broken one looked over them with pride and retired for the night secure in the knowledge that his new burglar alarm system would protect them in the middle of the night mr chan was jolted to consciousness by the sudden blare of the alarm he wrapped robe around himself and rushed downstairs but too late the display case was again smashed the statues gone and set of wet muddy miniscule footprints lead out of the shattered door mr chan attempted to give chase but failed to catch the culprits the police were again unable to turn up any clues but the childlike footprints which seemed particularly incongruous in the face of the fact that mr chan brand new steel reinforced door had been burst open seemingly without effort mr chan had lost confidence in san francisco finest he replaced the security precautions making them even stronger but determined to take direct action thus when the next shipment of statuettes arrived some months later delayed by blight on the burmese teak groves and typhoon in the china sea mr chan had plan of action he placed the figurines in the new display case and concealed himself behind curtain made of plastic beads and waited ancient chinese arquebus loaded and at the ready any thief who dared to venture into his store tonight would be in for nasty surprise the hours passed mr chan despite good intentions dropped off to sleep and the arquebus slipped off of his lap and slid behind large pile of javanese sandals then all of sudden there was tremendous ripping noise followed closely by the high pitched scream of the burglar alarm mr chan leaped to his feet clutching for his weapon but he could not find it the lights activated by the alarm system flashed on revealing to mr chan sight which made his blood freeze running quickly towards the display case in crouch to get through the low door was tremendous grizzly bear saliva dripped from its yellowed fangs and mr chan was almost overcome by the greasy stench of its fur despite its huge size the bear moved swiftly almost delicately on little tiny feet no bigger than those of ten year old child the bear reached the display case and with single swipe of its fearsome paw smashed the security glass it reached inside and rather clumsily gathered up all of the figurines then with an almost balletic move it spun round on its tiny feet and prepared to leave the store no more than ten seconds after it had entered mr chan was momentarily unnerved by the sudden appearence of the bear but the courage of generations of chinese warriors flowed in his veins brought to the fore by the desecration and theft of his most prized possesions taking no head for his personal safety caring not at all that he was frail and unarmed he leaped out from behind the bed curtain and in voice so filled with outrage that it even overcame the screaming sirens of the burglar alarm system shouted stop right where you are boyfoot bear with teak of chan father goose 35 once upon time in the kingdom of the pearls there lived an extremely cultured pearl named michael michael was pearl of high ideals

master am the genie of the lamp and am yours to command will grant you any wish any desire you may have nothing is beyond my power can make you rich can make you famous can make beautiful women fall in love with you can make the networks put star trek back on the air but am an eccentric genie and if all of this is to be yours you must do one thing benny knowing good deal when he hears one says what must do oh genie and the genie replied it is simple thing trifle really but must insist upon it you must never again under any circumstances and for any reason shave your beard if you let your whiskers grow will serve you faithfully and grant your every desire but should you ever shave again will strike you with lightning bolt reducing your body to ashes which will then store in gawdy funeral urn alongside the remains of all of my former faithless masters in cave in the vicinity of damascus benny being bum did nt shave very often anyway so this sounded like pretty good deal and he agreed he wished for wealth and lo and behold he was wealthy he wished to become powerful and he was immediately elected to the board of directors of seven companies and named time man of the year then he met sally sally was the most beautiful girl he ever seen and the moment he saw her he knew that she was the only woman for him as the genie had promised sally fell in love with him however despite her love she refused to marry him because she had been frightened at an early age by picture of george bernard shaw and refused to have anything to do with bearded man benny was inconsolable as he thought about it he recalled that except for that first meeting the genie had never mentioned word about not shaving besides now that benny had everything he wanted he could keep the genie in the lamp and it would never know that he shaved so he got out razor ran some hot water lathered up and shaved while he was at it he felt bit apprehensive but nothing seemed to be happening so he went ahead just as he zipped off the last whisker lightning bolt shot out of the clear blue sky burst through the roof of his penthouse struck him dead center and burned him to ashes the genie then issued forth from the lamp wearing an apron and carrying little dustpan and wiskbroom it swept up the ashes deposited them in mauve and puce urn of indescribably ugliness sealed it and flew off to damascus to deposit out poor hero in his final resting place which just goes to show that benny shaved is benny urned father goose 37 roy rogers gets new pair of boots but mountain lion eats the boots to get

the turk was assembling his army and scouting out bad king john he also ordered his engineers to design and build the largest rack heretofore made the rack was then fitted with wheels and required 40 horses to pull it when all was ready george the turk set out to do battle bad king john who was camped by river enjoying the spoils of his latest victory had not yet gotten word of george the turk army george the turk knew that his army must attack quickly before bad king john could prepare defense but alas the 40 horse team pulling the large rack could not keep up with the troops george the turk ordered more horses to be teamed but still they lagged george the turk remembered that hannibul was not too far away in the mountains with herd of elephants elephants would be better than horses for pulling the rack so george the turk sent his secondincommand to hannibul to rent enough elephants for the job hannibul agreed and also sent along his best elephant handler this elephant handler quickly realized the importance of his unique position in george the turk army and insisted that he be given the title of elephant engineer and huge pay raise george the turk agreed with the title and the pay raise the rack powered by elephants and driven by the elephant engineer kept pace with the rapidly moving army late one night they arrived at the enemy camp by the river george the turk deployed his troops to cut off any avenue of escape and issued the order to attack at dawn on his command he also ordered the rack to be positioned on the highest hill overlooking bad king john camp this site was the perfect spot to publically display bad king john to show the world what happens to anyone who dares to try to conquer the world with dawn approaching george the turk goes to the top of the hill beside the rack so that everyone can see his command to attack when his sword drops attack all is quiet the enemy camp is asleep every man is waiting for the signal the first ray of sunlight strikes the helmet of george the turk he draws his sword slowly and holds it over his head the sunlight gleams off the blade and scares the elephants that are hitched to the rack they start trumpeting and rearing and the elephant engineer ca nt control then he drops the reins and clings onto the rack for dear life the rack breaks loose from the team and starts rolling down the hill
