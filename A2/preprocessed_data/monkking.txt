the monkey king once upon time long time ago there was thick jungle where many kinds of animals lived in harmony together their ruler was wise old lion but one sad day the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be their new ruler the dead king had gold crown encrusted with precious gems and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward and each would try on the crown and the ruler would be the animal whose head it fitted now though many tried on the crown it fitted no one some heads were too big others too small few had horns and some had big ears the fact was that the old king crown did not fit any of the animals then cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever tricks first he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and round his middle without letting it fall to the ground then he tossed it higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down he then stood on his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes before jumping to his feet again and catching it in his hands all the animals laughed delightedly at the nimble monkey skill and clapped in excitement pleased at the great applause the monkey went on with his show till the enthusiastic crowd decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king the only animal to disagree was the fox silly creature like that ca nt be our king he said going to do all can to make him lose the throne one day having just managed to avoid trap that men had set at the edge of the jungle the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived covering the trap with dead leaves the fox picked large bunch of bananas and called up to the monkey sire sire can you help me have some ripe bananas like to present you with but ca nt climb trees as easily as you do would you please come down and accept my gift the unsuspecting monkey shinned down the tree and just as he reached for the bananas the trap suddenly clamped shut over his legs the fox began to laugh what foolish king we have fancy falling into trap for handful of bananas and calling all the other animals he went on just look at our sovereign is nt he stupid he ca nt even avoid being caught in trap if he is nt able to watch out for himself how can we expect him to look after us all the animals let themselves be persuaded by the fox words and in twinkling the monkey king was deprived of the crown and from that day on this particular jungle was the only one whose animals made do without king
