chapter um it not exactly what had in mind ernie ross looked ruefully at his imitation fur loincloth and flimsy plastic broadsword um sort of thought the girl behind the counter gave ernie sour look you wanted to play the goombah the barbarian virtual reality game right uh yeah ernie replied the girl examined sheet of paper cracking her gum loudly in that case you have to wear the fur loincloth and carry the plastic broadsword it says so right here ernie thought about this well in the ad it said that playing the game would be just like being goombah the barbarian there be monsters and wizards and everything just like the movie that correct replied the girl here at the virtual arcade we offer simulated reality games of just about any popular character or story line our huge mainframe computers allow us to synthesize any reality in amazingly high resolution allowing us to believably create stories in which you can be the main character you can step into the role of commando swashbuckler space traveler just about anything that any popular movie or book has featured recently you can act out the role of your favorite character doing anything that character could you can actually be your favorite fictional character you can live out your fantasies for only few dollars minute she seemed to reading from prepared statement well ernie was still unsure he had heard that these games were tremendous fun they had become very popular in the last few years you could now find virtual arcade at just about any major shopping mall they were franchised of course you had to pay through the nose to play but nobody seemed to mind they were just so much fun still feel silly wearing this fur loincloth and carrying this big plastic sword complained ernie that what goombah wears in the movie is nt it the girl said looking bored well the girl looked at the clock if you do nt want to play goombah the barbarian can let you play killer lesbians from outer space instead ve got game starting in ten minutes no no that okay ernie protested chime sounded your game starts in five minutes the girl warned ernie fluffing her hair absently well guess stuck with this ernie thought paid my 4795 and there no refund hope this turns out to be worth the money ernie was after all just college student and didnt have money to burn the chime sounded again this time more urgently second door on your right the girl said brightly this is not starting off well at all ernie thought as he headed down the hallway if this does nt improve real quick im going to file complaint or something ernie entered small cubicle technician sat him down in large comfortable reclining chair and fitted him with the stereo goggles and headset that made virtual reality come alive he even added the latest refinement tactile sensation electrodes which he glued to ernie body at strategic locations as ernie settled into the new visions and sensations that awaited him he began to feel somewhat better there before him was the mysterious landscape that goombah inhabited in the movies full of forbidding crags and castles shaped like skulls of course none of it was actually there but the illusion was amazingly realistic it was hard to believe it was all just synthesized artificial reality ernie was impressed maybe this will be okay after all he thought he unsheathed his huge plastic broadsword preparing to be attacked by dragons wizards or any of the other fearsome mythological characters that goombah customarily battled suddenly ernie heard loud highpitched bark he looked down and saw little white dog with black spot over one eye the dos looked up at him expectantly ernie was not prepared for something like this supposed to be goombah the barbarian he thought goombah does not have any silly little dog the dog suddenly jumped up into ernie arms he caught it automatically it peered up into his face as though expecting him to do something this has got to be mistake said ernie to himself exasperatedly this dog must be from somebody else game what am gon na do with him before he could think about the problem any further bright light in the sky attracted ernie attention here it comes he thought gripping his broadsword tightly what will it be demon flying dragon ernie strained his eyes it flying saucer sure enough it was flying saucer looking as though it had come straight from an old 1950 sciencefiction movie ernie was taken aback there were nt supposed to be any flying saucers in goombah the barbarian the flying saucer quickly landed few yards in front of ernie and two space creatures emerged they seemed to be some kind of humanoid reptiles they reminded ernie of giant iguanas the dog under ernie arm wriggled uncomfortably ernie frowned space creatures he thought what am supposed to do with space creatures this is nt what was expecting at all ernie frowned what kind of game is this anyway the creatures began approaching ernie maybe supposed to say something he considered suddenly an idea occurred to him he drew himself up to his full height klaatu barada nikto he announced one of the space creatures pulled out ray gun and pointed it at him hmm thought ernie maybe that was nt quite the right thing to say it occurred to ernie that strategic retreat might be good idea he looked around quickly unfortunately the landscape of swirling mists and forbidding hills did nt seem to contain anyplace to retreat to ernie turned back to the creatures look uh what said about klaatu did nt really mean the creature fired ernie felt himself suddenly stiffen into immobility it stunned sir ernie heard one creature say to the other good load it onto the ship the two creatures lifted ernie who had become stiff as board and began carrying him dog and all toward the ship in spite of himself ernie was impressed these special effects are fantastic he thought wonder how they do that stunner business suddenly costumed comicbook character appeared complete with flowing cape and big red on his chest he blocked the aliens path unhand that barbarian the comicbook character boomed the space creature looked at each other in confusion unhand what does that mean are we supposed to cut off his hands the comicbook character looked exasperated look just put him down okay he said in much more conversational tone put him down put him down one space creature looked at the other what do we do now sir oh do nt know the other creature replied just disintegrate him guess they drew their weapons the comicbook character looked confused um uh the creatures advanced menacingly suddenly the comicbook character shouted what seemed to ernie to be very odd thing jmp 08f1 instantly the entire scene vanished ernie still stiff and boardlike found himself unsupported and dropped three feet to land with thud on carpeted floor hi guy ernie heard someone say howya doin ernie attempted to moan but discovered that he was still quite securely frozen here let me help you up he heard the same voice say the room swung into view as he felt himself lifted up and placed on his feet like statue he seemed to be in someone living room the owner of the voice came into view it was the comicbook character who in the cold light of day appeared to be pleasant although rather vacuouslooking fellow of indeterminate age allow me to introduce myself he said cheerfully captain memory he extended hand ernie instinctively attempted to shake the man hand but discovered he was still quite frozen it occurred to him that he was still carrying the silly little dog which was also frozen the man dropped his outstretched hand embarrassedly hey forgot he said cheerfully you re still paralyzed hey no sweat it ll wear off in few minutes the man seated himself on nearby sofa and began perusing small book he had produced from somewhere ernie of course continued to stand where he was immobilized this is really weird game ernie thought the special effects are fantastic but the story line is bizarre like what am supposed to do now after about fifteen minutes ernie little finger began to twitch the twitching slowly spread across his hand finally with great effort ernie was able to take step towards the comicbook character who was still seated on the sofa reading his book the comicbook character looked up ah it wearing off he said are you feeling okay ungph said ernie discovering that the power of speech was slowly returning to him captain memory took that to mean yes good good he replied in cheerful tone wharf gumg om ernie got out with difficulty you re probably wondering what going on yarf ernie felt something sharp digging into his side it was the little dog trying to get away unfortunately that arm had not unfrozen yet ernie ability to speak seemed to have returned all right so what is going on had to rescue you from those creatures captain memory explained they were taking you to be cyberslave in the mining pits ernie frowned what cyberslave captain memory shook his head sadly they were going to force you to operate mining robots like so many other poor fools before you like you they thought they were going to play game the next thing they knew they were forced into life of virtual hard labor operating mining robots 24 hours day days week until finally their bodies shrivelled up and their brains burned out he sighed was too late for most of them but at least could save the two of you ernie shivered some of this was beginning to seem little too real man this is really strange game he said not complaining mind you mean the special effects alone make it worth the money he looked around he seemed to be in huge living room all decorated in 1950 style it all seemed very solid and believable ernie could nt help being impressed mean this is like so realistic it just that having real hard time following the story like what is supposed to be happening in this game anyway captain memory sighed look trying to explain this to you it not game okay that game business was just ruse it was trap to get you to come in and hook yourself up to their virtual reality system once you re in you ca nt get out they turn you into cyberslave and make you work until your brain burns up oh right ernie caught himself get it you re not supposed to admit it game you re supposed to pretend its real okay ll play along so what now captain memory shook his head sadly can see this isnt going to be easy he thought moment okay if this is game you should be able to quit any time you like right uh yeah this was beginning to make ernie uneasy so how do you quit the captain demanded where the esc button or break or whatever how do you get out ernie suddenly realized that he had nt been given any information on what to do when he wanted to quit playing uh well can quit anytime want he said defensively okay try captain memory demanded ernie shuffled uncomfortably well maybe not ready to quit yet try it just to see what happens the captain urged well ernie considered it looks like got into the wrong game here wanted to play goombah the barbarian mean no offense this is cool game and everything but really wanted to play goombah captain memory looked upset this really is nt game ernie sighed ll tell you what ll just give up on this for today and ll try again week from thursday okay so ill just be heading home now okay great said the captain enthusiastically just quit right now okay well okay ernie agreed halfheartedly he tried to think of what to do hello he called up into the air is anybody there like to go now nothing happened ernie heart began to pound hey cmon is nt anybody listening to me said wan na go no response this was beginning to be more than ernie felt he could deal with look not asking for my money back or anything ll you know try again some other time just want to go home okay no answer now ernie really did want to go he began to panic hey is nt anybody out there wake up do nt wan na play anymore wan na go home he wailed want my mommy nothing all right all right calm down captain memory tried to soothe ernie we ll get you out of here it just going to take little time ernie left arm unfroze convulsively dumping the little dog on the floor it growled unpleasantly why ca nt you get me out of here now he demanded petulantly the captain shrugged hey do nt run this show was lucky could even get you away from those creatures getting out is another story altogether oh this is awful ernie wailed he still was nt entirely sure whether this was game or not but whatever it was he didnt like it anymore maybe you better sit down captain memory moved over to one side of the sofa ernie decided that sitting down was probably good idea and did so this was beginning to get altogether too real anyway it could be worse how ernie moaned you could be like that poor guy over there the captain said gesturing towards the dog do nt need your sympathy the dog snapped ernie started talking dog this is unbelievable what next yeah yeah the dog snarled believe me you do nt look so hot in that ridiculous fur loincloth either goombah the barbarian sure the dog pulled cigar out of some invisible pocket and began to smoke it holding it in his front paw in very uncanine manner ernie was suddenly very conscious of his loincloth he looked at the dog what what see what mean the captain gestured towards the dog in virtual reality you can be anybody or anything you re lucky you came through as yourself you could have wound up like him as dog the dog made wry expression yeah right or like you he looked the captain up and down super hero he said sarcastically captain memory seemed nonplussed well what wrong with that sure the replied okay what super powers have you got the captain seemed defensive well do have some powers like what well the captain thought moment like program in assembler and he does nt wait minute ernie was confused who does nt why the man behind all this of course the captain explained the evil genius waldo stadium oh get it ernie brightened this really is game right captain memory sighed exasperatedly look for the last time this is not game the evil genius waldo stadium has embarked on plan to take over the entire world computing power he been breaking into people systems one at time taking control of them and linking them to his other systems to create vast network that grows more powerful all the time when he takes over system he establishes complete control over anything and anybody that happens to be in it at the time that how you fell into his clutches he taken over the virtual arcades anyone who was playing virtual reality games there is now his cyberslave oh man ernie sank his head into his hands this was just too much to handle suddenly thought occurred to him so how did we get here anyway he gestured to the room around them captain memory pulled himself up to his full height brought you here he said proudly he turned to the dog see told you had powers great said the dog sarcastically so where are we anyway we re in virtual reality the captain explained you know cyberspace wait minute ernie was finding this all hard to follow if we re still in the computer does nt that mean that this guy waldo supermarket has control over us stadium captain memory corrected whatever ernie said exasperatedly what about my question who in control here ah that the beauty of it explained the captain warming to his subject he been taking over systems so fast that he cant keep track of them he does nt even know what he got remember when he takes over system he gets everything that was in it he got games spreadsheets database files and hundreds of different virtual realities all mixed together in no order thats what gives us our window of opportunity we can hide out in areas he does nt even know he got until we figure out how to bring this diabolical scheme to halt ernie thought about this okay we re in cyberspace right but where in cyberspace the captain slumped well do nt exactly know the dog snickered some super hero well well was under lot of pressure the captain said defensively those creatures would have had you in another second so just picked location at random and jumped to it you jumped to it ernie was confused how do you do that that the beauty of assembler the captain answered enthusiastically you can do stuff like that now with high level language you never be able to do stuff like that you can only do what the language says you can do in assembler you can do anything captain memory chuckled that waldo weak point he refuses to learn assembler he insists you can do all this stuff in or whatever language he using now well we ll show suddenly the dog broke in at random he barked you jumped at random well the captain was taken aback you mean the dog continued we could have wound up in the middle of spreadsheet ernie tried to imagine life in spreadsheet it did nt sound too appealing it was chance had to take captain memory explained defensively great the dog snarled you take chances with our lives okay okay the captain said placatingly ve got better location he rummaged furiously through the pockets in his costume wrote it down it here somewhere he continued searching um no um aha he brandished small slip of paper in the air here it is he read the paper aloud it inspected by no 42 some super hero the dog repeated the captain frowned well maybe that not the right one he continued to rummage through his pockets sure had it here somewhere ernie looked askance at the comicbook character you dont remember it captain memory fidgeted uncomfortably hey it not easy to remember long string of numbers in hex you know doing the best can ernie moaned quietly this was all giving him terrible headache suddenly thought occurred to him hey this is all really just game right captain memory looked annoyed no it is not game it never was game will you please stop saying that ernie moaned quietly captain memory glanced at his wrist we better hurry we re running out of time ernie looked up you do nt have watch he said suspiciously captain memory continued to look at his bare wrist well no he said bit crestfallen always wanted one though ernie looked around ca nt we just stay here it nice here they seemed to be in very large living room of wellkept home it appeared to be furnished in fabulous fifties style except for few odd objects that ernie could nt identify we ca nt stay in one place to long replied captain memory waldo stadium is sorting his data as fast as he can if we stay in one place too long sooner or later he ll zero in on us anyway captain memory looked around this place is beginning to look kind of familiar to me if right this is nt safe place to be okay then where are we the dog demanded think we ve landed in game called attack of the giant eggplant if right this place is going to be nuked in he glanced at his bare wrist again oh fortyfive minutes or so ernie began to be aware of queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach this is making me anxious he thought not going to do things like this anymore that it no more virtual reality for me maybe you like to watch some tv captain memory suggested cheerfully maybe that would make you feel better thought we were in hurry ernie answered we can watch for couple minutes the captain replied guess that makes as much sense as anything else ernie thought and followed the captain towards the other end of the room where he noticed television with tenfootwide screen playing with the sound turned off as they approached the television ernie noticed large high backed 50sstyle sofa positioned close in front of the tv as they came around the side of the sofa ernie was startled to see two people sitting there staring intently at the television screen hey ernie uttered involuntarily the two people seemed oblivious to ernie presence um hello ernie said tentatively excuse me the people did not respond captain memory sighed it too late for them afraid ernie moaned wished you stop saying depressing things it makes my stomach hurt oh sorry captain memory seemed concerned um how about it too late for them pleased to say that not much better captain memory shrugged hey tried he fell silent ernie looked at the people they seemed frozen into position staring at the television they seemed emaciated their muscles seemed to have withered in the positions they were in okay so what wrong with them captain memory shook his head they ve been in cyberspace too long he said sadly there limit to how much of this you can take you know your brain burns out do nt think these two have much longer all they can do is sit here in front of the tv captain memory sighed terrible just terrible look at them they ca nt even change channels anymore ernie shuddered this is gruesome he thought think its bad for me to look at gruesome things oh well captain memory brightened ca nt be helped the captain unceremoniously pushed the stricken couple off the sofa they fell stiffly to the floor motionless except for their eyes which rotated to stay fixed on the television screen captain memory seated himself as comfortably as possible on the sofa so what do you want to watch they heard voice behind them crap the dog was looking ruefully at his halfburned cigar and cursing quietly what the matter captain memory inquired cheerfully almost out of cigars the dog groused here am stuck in this stupid pointless computer game and ca nt even get decent cigar well maybe we can get you some more uh what was your name again the captain inquired sterno the dog intoned pompously sterno said ernie dubiously what kind of name is that sterno is those little cans of heating stuff ll have you know that am lord high keeper of the sacred flame why in better days oh remember now the captain broke in brightly thats game called dog star you must have been playing it when waldo took over your system that why you re trapped in the body of dog sterno was taken aback uh well yeah was lord high keeper of the sacred flame huh the captain continued you were doing pretty good sterno brightened well yes as matter of fact wan na watch stump the stars captain memory said to ernie cutting off sterno tales of past glory what that about inquired ernie it this game show where famous hollywood celebrities have to answer these questions and if they get them wrong they get their arms and legs chopped off stumps get it captain memory laughed ernie frowned do nt like these new game shows he glanced at the television the program seemed to be game show the mc was an unpleasant looking man wearing black military uniform with skulls on the collar he wore monocle in his left eye and carried riding crop which he periodically cracked against his jackboots oh it one of those sadistic nazi game show hosts said ernie is nt there anything else on captain memory was paging through copy of tv guide doesnt look like there anything on except game shows how about vomit for dollars ernie grimaced here movie the captain continued how about the humpback of notre dame starring ronald reagan you know the one about the whale that plays football ernie sighed what this we re watching now do nt know captain memory reached for dial let turn up the volume and find out the offcamera announcer voice came blasting out off the set painfully loud time for wheel of torture the show which every week asks the question how much can you take the sound of applause welled up from the audience and here our host the announcer continued the gestapos greatest that famous fiend sturmbannfuhrer dr heinz von liederkranz once again the sound of applause welled up the sound seemed to be growing impossibly loud in fact it seemed to be coming from all around them the game show host smiled and bowed to the audience tank you tank you now let drag in today first victim the announcer continued from palo alto california let have big round of applause for captain memory the huge waves of applause filled ernie head blocking out everything else he clenched his eyes tightly trying to regain his composure he opened them again and staggered back in shock they were no longer in the suburban living room they were actually standing on the stage that they had been watching only seconds before they had actually been sucked into the game show captain memory seemed confused hey uh wait minute did nt the announcer continued and here contestant number two from the land that time forgets let have big hand for goombah the barbarian ernie realized that they meant him nazi ss trooper grabbed him and shoved him roughly forward hey lem me go ow look not supposed say just love your loincloth the announcer quipped ernie could hear the audience laughing he began to feel terribly selfconscious and what cute little dog the announcer went on sterno did nt seem to be particularly bothered by the state of affairs say you got cigar why sure the announcer handed him one the audience chuckled the announcer continued well all right then dr von liederkranz what are we going to start out with today the nazi smiled theatrically vell biff tought shtart out vit liddle infention of mein own de hot vhirling corshcrew he pulled out fiendishlooking device made of glowing whirling metal parts without warning he jabbed captain memory with it the captain let out bloodcurdling shriek the audience applauded wildly very good the announcer exclaimed jovially now let see how that rated on our applause meter 57 well that forget this shouted captain memory jmp 08f1 suddenly ernie found himself back on the porcelain sofa the tv was now off ernie was trembling wha what happened captain memory was rubbing his side ruefully oh jumped us back here really did nt like that hot whirling corkscrew good cigar though sterno added puffing away the cigar seemed to have improved his disposition somewhat do nt understand ernie whined you know how in lot of computer games there these little doors or windows or something and when you step through them you re on whole different level captain memory asked yeah ernie replied tentatively well the captain gestured towards the tv that one of them ernie noticed an odd smell he glanced towards the floor the two shrivelled people were vibrating wisps of smoke seemed to be coming out of their ears oh forgot said the captain you re never supposed to turn the tv off on these people something bad happens forget exactly what but it real bad ernie continued to watch the couple in horror the smoke was coming more heavily new their foreheads seemed to be bulging what what are we gon na do ernie choked out captain memory regarded his bare wrist carefully some day gon na get watch he said thoughtfully really think we ought to do something said ernie anxiously smoke was coming out of their noses now light seemed to be appearing behind their eyes silver watch might be nice do you think silver would look good with this outfit captain memory wondered really really think we ought to do something said ernie urgently the tv addicts bodies were beginning to swell rapidly ernie inched away from them oh well said captain memory unhurriedly guess its time to go uh let see he thought moment let try push ff0c with that they were gone ernie blinked and staggered the scene had changed completely now he saw an elaborate 18th century drawing room around him the walls were decorated with filigreed mirrors and candelabras delicate furniture surrounded them it all looked very expensive captain memory looked about obviously pleased with himself hey it worked ernie head swam he felt confused and disoriented these abrupt changes of scene were making him sick he sagged into chair do nt feel very good he complained sterno puffed his cigar this is almost decent he mused you do nt suppose there snifter of brandy about do you the sound of harpsichord drifted in from somewhere ah telemann sterno commented very tasteful captain memory turned to ernie gee sorry you re not feeling well he commiserated would it make you feel better to watch some tv ernie sat bolt upright no the captain had brought along his copy of tv guide youre missing the ozzie and hitler show do nt care this is good episode ozzie forgets that the boss is coming for dinner so hitler has to invade poland on moments notice captain memory chuckled do nt like these tv programs grumbled ernie well you know said captain memory conversationally if you re going to travel to other realities you re not always going to be able to get your favorite tv shows want to go home ernie sulked suddenly thought occurred to him he brightened hey this is really just game right sterno glared at him this game business is getting really old knock it off okay ernie had begun methodically feeling the furniture he reasoned that if it were virtual reality illusion he would be able to see it but since it had no substance he would nt be able to feel it if my hand goes right through this stuff he figured ll know it just an illusion unfortunately everything was proving to be distressingly solid you know you look really stupid in that fur loincloth sterno commented and what in the world are you going to do with that ridiculous plastic broadsword well hadda put deposit on it said ernie defensively if do nt bring it back lose 40 bucks sterno shook his head he turned to captain memory do we really have to drag this kid around with us captain memory shook his head sadly afraid so why sterno demanded well you know the captain said offhandedly we cant just leave him to be cyberslave it would nt be you know nice thought occurred to ernie so what are we supposed to do about all of this anyway hmm captain memory still perusing the tv guide was not paying very much attention like are we just going to keep bopping around cyberspace or what mean do you have plan or something captain memory pulled himself up of course have plan he turned to sterno see have powers and have plan okay okay sterno agreed wearily you re fine super hero so what the plan we have to find way to terminate this reality within the confines of it own logic the captain explained huh ernie did nt follow this we have to end the game the captain rephrased we have to carry it through to it logical conclusion so that it terminates and shuts down ernie frowned what the point of this game anyway that problem the captain admitted this is nt game it dozens maybe hundreds of games all stuck together in no order the point of what we re in now could be the point of any of the games or all of them or none of them there no way to tell luckily we do nt have to win the game we just have to end it any ending that logically consistent will do sterno frowned why do you have to end it within it own logic system could nt you just crash it captain memory sighed could crash the system but it would nt be good idea why not sterno demanded why ca nt you just insert some totally impossible instruction and crash out the whole system then this whole thing would be over and we could get out of here that true the captain admitted but you get some bad um side effects like what sterno wanted to know you see captain memory explained after you ve been in cyberspace for while you brain gets synchronized with it and your system becomes adapted to it if it suddenly crashes it causes tremendous shock to your system what you mean we re going through all this just to avoid an upset stomach or something sterno asked sarcastically after all how bad could it be well um the captain looked very uncomfortable it not just an upset stomach okay sterno demanded then what does it cause um generally cardiac arrest the captain answered reluctantly sterno was shocked you mean if you crash the system itll kill us afraid so the captain nodded sadly along with anybody else who hooked into the system at the time ernie began to worry what about ending the game then wont that kill us too does that mean we re trapped here forever he began to panic no no calm down said the captain reassuringly if we end the game within the confines of it own logic it ll shut down in an orderly manner giving your systems time to readjust before you re returned to realityit wo nt be shock to your systems and your hearts wo nt stop it only if it suddenly abruptly stops like when the system crashes that okay okay we get the picture sterno broke it dont crash the system okay captain memory returned to the tv guide ernie sighed it was bad enough being trapped in computer game now his life was in danger as well and his only hope seems to be this costumed clown who thinks he super hero was nt this ever going to stop getting worse suddenly captain memory started oh no he wailed not that what happened what happened cried ernie panicstricken what could possibly have happened that was worse than the predicament they were already in captain memory was still holding the tv guide we missed gilligan island ernie cradled his head in his hands ca nt stand it just ca nt stand it chapter ernie was beginning to feel little bit better after all nothing really weird had happened for about oh twenty minutes or so things were relatively speaking pretty quiet ernie examined his surroundings what is this place it spaceship said captain memory conversationally ernie was skeptical it does nt look like spaceship sterno sniffed they do nt have to always be those ghastly chromeandglass space things utterly tasteless this place sterno looked about approvingly is actually not bad ernie was unconvinced it not moving sure it is the captain returned you just ca nt feel it wan na look out captain memory stood up and walked over to what appeared to be small harpsichord he regarded the keys lets see um major he hit the appropriate keys with deep rumbling sound the ceiling slid back revealing view of deep space ah captain memory was pleased he returned to the sofa ernie regarded the view with amazement stars and galaxies burned brightly against the blackness of space they seemed to be an incredible distance from earth ernie turned to captain memory where are we the captain shrugged space but where in space ernie wanted to know are we far from earth captain memory concentrated let see um long long ago in galaxy far far ernie frowned the captain stopped wait that not right he furrowed his brow well ca nt exactly recall where we are but it does nt really matter captain memory was absorbed in looking at the vista of deep space after all when you wish upon star it makes no difference where you are ernie frowned something about that bugs me it does nt sound quite cricket agreed sterno well by jiminy exclaimed the captain we ll just have to move on to something else wan na watch some tv rather not said ernie aww captain memory was disappointed ernie looked around are we safe here for the moment the captain shrugged as said we cant stay anywhere too long waldo will zero in on us if we do then what ernie wanted to know dunno the captain mused suppose he ll come after us ernie frowned you mean he ll come in himself like personally captain memory thought about that well do nt suppose he ll come in as himself after all you can be anyone or anything in cyperspace he ll come in the form of someone else some famous person or someone he like to be like you and your superhero outfit sterno broke in well yeah the captain admitted ernie gave than some thought so what form would an evil genius want to take captain memory shrugged dunno nazi maybe he returned to the tv guide this is much like my own virtual reality mused sterno he seemed to have found snifter of brandy somewhere which he swirled pensively in his left paw had drawing room like this wrote poetry there immortal odes to the glory of the canine race really captain memory was not really paying attention in fact happen to have some with me perhaps you like to see it mmm captain memory was gazing at the view sterno took his answer to be yes and handed him piece of paper with some verses on it captain memory barely glanced at it looks like doggerel to me he said uncaringly sterno mood turned black suppose you think thats funny he snarled open my heart to you and you mock me well we ll see who has the last laugh know when right right and you re wrong and that all there is to it ernie thought moment sounds to me like you re being bit dogmatic to me you fool sterno barked you do nt even have the vaguest idea what going on here you re fine one to talk captain memory abruptly changed the subject wan na watch some tv ernie really did nt want to watch any tv but he was feeling very uncomfortable with the current drift of the conversation maybe watching tv would be good way to change the subject uh this is nt gon na be like last time is it we re not going to get sucked into the tv show again are we naw the captain assured him that was fluke oneina million chance it ll never happen again well okay then ernie agreed reluctantly captain memory returned to the harpsichord um fsharp he hit the appropriate keys the ceiling viewscreen suddenly changed from view of space to television picture they seemed to have tuned in to commercial the announcer was an dour looking man wearing brown military uniform and jackboots he seemed to be making strenuous effort to be cheerful hi martin bohrmann the announcer held up two record albums and if you remember me you remember hitler greatest hits do nt remember that said ernie to noone in particular now together at last on these two longplaying record albums 50 alltime golden hits from the third reich you get the gestapo glee club with heil hitler dear militarysounding music started up in the background do we have to watch this ernie complained you ca nt buy these records in any store but if you call this number secret messenger will knock on your door in the middle of the night and oh okay ll change it captain memory struck key on the harpsichord the screen changed to blackandwhite characters in 1950 clothing appeared it an old movie ernie commented he felt better an old movie that would be safe right nothing bad could happen out of an old movie right man in suit with cloth over his head appeared on the screen pretty young woman came up to him and suddenly yanked the cloth away under the cloth the man had the tremendously enlarged head of fly complete with huge multifaceted eyes antennae and long black snout the young woman began to scream hey remember this said ernie brightly it the fly the original version too you know that movie about the scientist who goes into matter transmitter except fly gets in it and he winds up with the head of fly hey this is great movie ernie settled back to watch pleased that he could finally watch something he understood the movie cut to commercial hi martin bohrmann and if you remember me ernie moaned wish they would nt keep running the same commercial he thought the commercial ended and now back to the dating game the dating game ernie sat bolt upright do nt wan na watch the dating game what happened to my movie captain memory looked up oh game show he said brightly he had nt been paying much attention up to this point like game shows you know you can really get into game shows know ernie interrupted that what afraid of the man on the screen looked like typical game show host wearing plaid polyester suit with large carnation in his lapel the only thing that seemed bit odd about him is that he was wearing jackboots and monocle congratulations he was saying to an excited female contestant youfe von an allexpensespaid dream date vit bachelor number the game show host seemed to have bit of german accent oh just ca nt wait to see him the young woman was jumping up and down with excitement bachelor number three come on out the game show host called out door opened and out stepped man wearing suit who had the enormously enlarged head of fly the young woman began to scream ernie looked confused hey what are we watching anyway is this the fly or the dating game or what captain memory was looking at the tv guide upsidedown mmm hmm he agreed not paying much attention the host seemed to be wrapping the show up vell folks dis is biff mozzarella saying wait minute sterno interrupted think something smells around here captain memory looked up got problem he asked unconcernedly think about it sterno considered his name mozzarella huh said ernie you mean biff this guy name is mozzarella sterno noted the last guys name was liederkranz so asked ernie uncomprehendingly cheese get it cried sterno they re both cheese do nt think like the sound of this ernie thought um well you know he began to captain memory maybe we ought to give this some consideration but it was too late with deafening roar the delicate panel doors to the room were blown off their hinges dozen armed men rushed in pointing wickedlooking weapons at the trio freeze one of them shouted captain memory looked uncomprehending it seems bit warm for that he commented the group of armed men parted to make way for an unpleasant looking man wearing black military uniform jackboots and monocle zo ve meet again the man did in fact look somewhat familiar to ernie have nt seen you somewhere before the man smiled warmly no doubt you ve seen my tv show the torture game is big hit these days he drew himself up to his full height sturmbannfuhrer dr heinz von liederkranz the gestapo greatest he paused he seemed to be waiting for applause his men looked at each other quickly and began clapping ernie thought it might be good idea if he applauded too enough von liederkranz silenced his men with quick sweep of his riding crop leaving ernie applauding feebly all by himself ernie looked around and quickly stopped von liederkranz prodded captain memory in the chest with his riding crop now you will tell us your name rank and serial number my what captain memory looked uncomprehending your name rank and serial number name rank and cereal number mused the captain but never even eat cereal do not be coy with us snapped the sturmbannfuhrer we know you are one of them ve know you are spy on mission of sabotage and destruction he paused calculatingly remember ve have vays of making you talk ernie turned to captain memory in confusion who are these guys anyway they look like bunch of nazis the captain replied thoughtfully but they could be enough von liederkranz broke in you vill answer our questions captain memory concentrated how about who put the bop in the bopshubopshubop he suggested von liederkranz tone abruptly changed you know he turned to captain memory ve do not haff to be enemies ve could be friends you vould like to be friends nein sure captain memory was nothing if not agreeable then tell us vot ve vant to know okay the captain thought minute the attack is set for exactly 1030 julius caesar will march on omaha and the enterprise will attack the titanic somewhere in the south china sea then patton will drive up through the south of france make right onto route 66 go down three stop lights turn right and its the third house from the corner just as ve thought this of course was not what the sturmbannfuhrer had thought at all however he had to maintain good appearance in front of his men he smiled amiably please go on captain memory decided it was time to stop think ve said too much already von liederkranz face turned hard you misunderstand he said menacingly not asking you telling you talk now really rather not captain memory did nt seem to be too upset by the proceedings ernie however was beginning to sweat sterno was glaring at the other two giving them an itoldyouso look von liederkranz smiled sadistically you ca nt escape you know ve haff total control of all computation in zis sector ze system vill not accept commands from anyone but me dere is no vay out ve have you vhere ve vant you well captain memory began afraid do nt have time so be it cried von liederkranz if dat de vay you are going to be bring on de hot vhirling corkscrew captain memory looked pained you know really do nt care for the hot vhirling mean whirling corkscrew von liederkranz laughed sadistically you are very funny ve vill see how funny you vill be after few hours vit mein corkscrew captain memory seemed offended well if you re going to be like that simply going to have to leave von liederkranz laughed sadistically again in fact he did nt seem to be able to laugh any other way dere is no way out von liederkranz continued you can not break into ze system from here ernie noticed his stomach beginning to hurt again stress he thought it not good for me to be under this much stress think it affecting my health maybe getting an ulcer von liederkranz switched on his hot whirling corkscrew which true to it name began to whirl and glow laughing sadistically as usual he began to bring it closer and closer to captain memory face the torture device edged ever nearer inch by inch spinning and hissing as it approached captain memory unprotected face ernie shut his eyes tightly it too horrible he thought cant watch he waited for the inevitable screams captain memory looked miffed okay be like that jmp 08f1 ernie opened his eyes the rococo sitting room had vanished they seemed to be back in the huge chicago living room that they had originally found themselves in after leaving the simulation arcade ernie head swam this is all changing too fast for me he thought just ca nt keep up with it he found chair and sat down ernie did nt feel well at all captain memory was strolling around ruefully inspecting the surroundings look at this place he lamented what mess ernie looked about the place was in fact in dismal shape the walls were covered with soot the furniture was singed much of the furniture was knocked over some was totally splintered it looked rather like bomb had gone off in the room ernie recovered enough composure to speak why why are we back here oh apologize for that captain memory explained just could nt think of anyplace else on such short notice should have known this place would be mess ernie looked around yeah this place has really gone to the dogs suppose you think that funny sterno growled ernie noticed two piles of burned rags lying near the tv set they were still smoldering slightly he shuddered he would rather not think about what might have happened here well well ernie started again how did we get here that nazi said we could nt escape he said they controlled all computation in the sector that right captain memory smiled we jumped to different sector ernie decided to just accept that explanation even though he did nt entirely understand it makes about as much sense as anything else sterno agreed he seemed to have found another cigar and was puffing away on it contentedly he seemed to be in much better mood whenever he had cigar pity you could nt have transported that brandy along with us though ernie was desperately trying to make sense of all of this so who were those nazi guys anyway that hard to say for sure cm said thoughtfully theyre probably cyberslaves just like you would have been if hadnt rescued you ernie shuddered he really did nt like the sound of that cyberslave stuff what about their leader von liederkranz sterno wondered he did nt look slave in fact he seemed to be having really good time the captain nodded sure he not slave he agreed he one of the slavemasters in fact captain memory furled his brow in thought he might even be waldo stadium himself so what are we doing in all of this ernie wanted to know sterno rolled his eyes upward hopeless do nt pick on the kid captain memory defended ernie yeah ernie agreed after all captain memory continued it not his fault he stupid yeah it ernie broke off that was nt turning out the way he hoped sterno looked at the captain so what kind of super hero are you supposed to be anyway me captain memory expounded why strange visitor from another planet who came to earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men powers and abilities ernie wanted to know like what captain memory continued expansively faster than speeding bullet more powerful than locomotive why can even leap tall buildings in single bound this was beginning to sound bit familiar to ernie anything else can also change the course of mighty rivers and bend steel in my bare hands ve got it now thought ernie you do nt by any chance tend to go around disguised as clark kent mildmannered reporter for great metropolitan newspaper and fight neverending battle for truth justice and the american way do you captain memory looked totally mystified why no why would want to do thing like that ernie was nonplussed well dunno just sort of thought he trailed off there was an awkward silence sterno cleared his throat you do nt suppose these people keep caviar about somewhere do you grateful for the interruption ernie began searching he found small white cabinet that looked like it might be refrigerator ah he pulled out small jar how this sterno examined the jar ruefully oh he sniffed american caviar well suppose beluga was bit too much to ask well just have to rough it imagine he looked around you wouldnt happen to have slice of fresh onion by any chance captain memory had returned to perusing the tv guide wan na watch some tv he asked brightly it almost time for that great game show about the dinosaur age which one is that ernie could nt recall any shows about dinosaurs oh sure you ve seen it it real famous the captain explained it called you bet jurassic ernie frowned something about that name did seem bit familiar all these familiarsounding things that he could nt quite place were making him very uneasy suddenly the television came on prepare to die inferior creatures the speaker blared ernie was annoyed thought we turned that off captain memory looked upset oh dear forgot about that ernie began to get that queasy feeling in his stomach again forgot about what the television screen showed huge purple vegetable lifting itself up on green stalk it seemed to be gloating insofar as vegetable can gloat you will soon respire your last animal scum the vegetable continued no longer shall we of the vegetable kingdom be your helpless victims to be bred and destroyed at your whims the day of reckoning is here at last prepare to receive the vengeance of the vegetables ernie shifted his weight uncomfortably this sure is weird program oh it not program captain memory explained the killer eggplants are about to attack ernie thought he better sit down again huh told you we re in game called attack of the killer eggplants captain memory regarded his bare wrist oh dear its been almost fortyfive minutes ernie did nt get it do nt get it he said remember those nukes told you about ernie did nt like the sound of this he tried to put the pieces together they re going to nuke us afraid so said captain memory cheerily he did nt seem particularly upset at the idea why to put an end to the revolt of the vegetables captain memory explained and fry the great eggplant once and for all ernie was trying hard to understand all of this let me get this straight you mean the vegetables have risen up in revolt of course not captain memory laughed how could vegetables possibly do thing like that ernie was getting frustrated then what is going on captain memory chuckled oh it all big practical joke ernie felt relieved then they re not going to nuke chicago oh no they re really going to do it captain memory seemed to think this was all very funny after all they do nt know its joke do they it would nt be very funny if they knew it was joke would it captain memory chuckled nope they re going to bomb the whole city back to the stone age ernie heard the sound of jets flying very close by outside he began to feel very uneasy so um what are we going to do do asked captain memory innocently ernie began to feel an intense heat radiating through the walls he clenched his eyes tightly closed ll just close my eyes he thought maybe when open them again this will all be gone he opened his eyes it was all gone ernie was taken aback wow he thought it worked he looked around they were in the midst of grassy field studded with wildflowers bright sunshine bathed the scene captain memory was idly toying with blades of grass sterno was sniffing the flowers where are we ernie asked dumbly why the stone age of course captain memory seemed to think this was quite obvious somewhere in the jurassic period think you knew this would happen ernie cried sure replied the captain offhandedly it part of the game ernie sighed gentle breeze swayed the tall grass he could hear birdsongs in the distance it all seemed very peaceful good thought ernie could use break he lay down in the grass and rested at least he thought we wo nt have to watch any tv the sun moved slowly across the sky as the hours passed after time ernie sat up it occurred to him that he might be getting sunburn so what are we gon na do in the stone age he asked get stoned sterno offered captain memory looked at his bare wrist glad you mentioned that he said it time we were on our way knew should nt have said anything ernie thought oh well it too late now so now what we better find cave before it gets dark do nt you think captain memory said cheerily would nt want to have run in with one of those sabertooth tigers would we ernie frowned he had forgotten that there would be things like sabertooth tigers in the stone age although he supposed he should have realized that it suddenly occurred to him that stone age caves often held giant cave bears um maybe we should think about this he called out to captain memory the captain however was already far ahead of ernie striding purposefully towards ridge of white cliffs in the distance he seemed not to hear ernie or if he did he paid no attention ernie hurried to catch up at least you re properly dressed for the occasion sterno commented to ernie understand fur loincloths are all the rage this year sterno snickered ernie looked down at his garment he had been wearing it so long he had sort of forgotten about it if we run into any sabertooth tigers sterno continued you can just chop them up with your plastic broadsword sterno laughed unpleasantly are you still carrying that thing captain memory called without looking back hey it forty buck deposit okay ernie sensed that they were both laughing at him gim me break huh hopeless just hopeless sterno muttered amused ernie began to be able to make out an odd looking object in the distance it seemed to be some sort of primitive building as they approached ernie began to see it more clearly it seemed to be house made out of huge slabs of stone holes were cut in the front slab for windows and door huge flat slab made up the roof sitting outside the house was very odd object it was wooden framework connected to two huge stone rollers there was seat on the framework and piece of fur held up above the seat creating primitive roof how odd commented sterno some sort of totem object no doubt perhaps throne of some sort they approached the house it began to look bit familiar to ernie those fur curtains on the windows where had he seen those before neat walk led toward the front door at the end of the walk was stone box held up on pole there was something written on the box the name confirmed ernie worst fears flintstone hey guys ernie called out hmm returned captain memory continuing to walk toward the house he was as usual not paying much attention to ernie um do nt think we should go in there why not captain memory did not even slow down ve got real bad feeling about this place aww is the big strong barbarian afraid of the little house sneered sterno well then he can just stay out here with the sabertooth tigers if he likes the two of them continued into the house leaving ernie standing alone on the front walk ernie looked around the sun was slowly edging towards the horizon casting long menacinglooking shadows ernie found himself anxiously looking around for places large enough for sabertooth tiger to hide in well he thought there not much point in standing here might as well go in stepping inside the doorway ernie found himself in living room appointed with furniture made of stone and wood captain memory and sterno had made themselves comfortable on the stoneand fur sofa the owners of the house were nowhere in sight rather luxurious for the stone age do nt you think commented sterno captain memory was once again engrossed in his copy of the tv guide ernie noticed across from the sofa what appeared to be roughly carved stone television set he moaned whatever is the matter said sterno impatiently hey guys ernie implored really think we ought to get out of here think this is some kind of trap or something sterno rolled his eyes upward paranoia he commented the poor creature would like to think he important enough for anyone to bother persecuting he turned to ernie who in the world would want to lay trap for you what possible use could they have for you if they caught you ernie shifted back and forth uncomfortably suddenly an object caught his eye paranoia huh he demanded what about that he pointed to an object in dark corner ernie exclamation was enough to tear captain memorys attention away from his tv guide he peered at the object it was box with what appeared to be lens attached to it as they looked at it it whirred quietly moving the lens back and forth it hidden camera ernie cried triumphantly we re being watched sterno was nonplussed where did that come from well tear it out then captain memory said ernie strode over to the dark corner grabbed to camera and yanked it out of it mounting he dashed it to the ground where it shattered revealing feebly glowing electronic parts which slowly one by one went out well so much for that captain memory returned to the tv guide is that all exclaimed ernie well what else did you want asked captain memory mystified look just proved to you that this is some kind of trap or something cried ernie exasperatedly there was hidden camera watching us for heaven sake so you took it out captain memory seemed perfectly satisfied so much for that ernie was getting very frustrated well well what if there another oh very much doubt that sterno commented captain memory was still studying his tv guide wan na watch some tv he asked brightly no ernie was building up real aversion to television why not captain memory could nt imagine why anyone would not want to watch tv look said ernie desperately this is the stone age right there are nt supposed to be any tvs here they have nt been invented yet this is before television captain memory chuckled do nt be silly no time is before television he got up and walked over to the set how primitive sterno commented no remote control thats only to be expected in the stone age suppose look said ernie urgently positive there were no televisions in the stone age captain memory sighed be reasonable he said have you ever seen oh let say was teenage caveman ernie thought moment um yes where did you see it on tv it takes place in the stone age right um yeah ernie was nt sure he liked the way this line of questioning was going well how could that be unless there were televisions in the stone age captain memory cried triumphantly rest my case sterno applauded bravo he said politely well well ernie was sure there was something wrong with this argument but he could nt quite figure out what it was he noticed that noone was listening to him anyway captain memory switched on the television being primitive set it took long time to warm up picture of room very much like the one the three were in appeared on the television screen taken from an odd angle eww blackandwhite sniffed sterno this really is the stone age is nt it ernie stared at the picture man in comicbookcharacter outfit accompanied by dog entered the room and they both sat down after short wait another figure clad in fur loincloth and carrying large plastic broadsword also entered the characters seemed to be conversing but their voices were too indistinct to understand ca nt hear what they re saying captain memory said seems to be sound problem sterno sniffed only to be expected from prehistoric tv stations suddenly one of the characters pointed directly at them hidden camera they heard the figure say we re being watched the other characters said something indistinct the figure in the loincloth loomed larger and larger in the picture until finally the screen was entirely taken up by face not unlike ernie own huge hand loomed up over the screen and the picture went dead ernie looked at the dead television screen do nt like the looks of this at all he said warily neither do agreed captain memory let watch something else he changed the channel different scene appeared in it two men were seated at large array of electronic equipment their backs to the audience they were peering intently at their devices and conversing looks like they found the hidden camera one said to the other what are we gon na do let switch over to the second camera what if they find that one they wo nt they do nt suspect thing the two men flipped some switches here we go said the first wan na see it sure the man flipped switch suddenly the scene changed back to the room suspiciously like their own the figure in the loincloth appeared upset hey cried ernie hey cried the loinclothclad figure on the television that us that us echoed his tv image captain memory regarded the television picture not very interesting show he commented echoed moment later by the comicbookclad character on the television seems bit repetitious might as well turn it off wait ernie cried but it was too late captain memory had already shut off the set captain memory was confused wait thought you did nt want to watch tv just turned it off to be nice can turn it back on if you want he reached toward the set no no uh that okay uh thanks just as soon we did nt watch anything right now if you do nt mind ernie was not prepared for the possible consequences of turning on the tv again he had more than enough to deal with as it was ernie gathered up his thoughts okay guys look got ta tell you something this place is not what it seems really captain memory had returned to the study of his favorite reading matter the tv guide ernie continued this is nt typical stone age house okay it actually set from 1960 cartoon series called the flintstones oh we know that captain memory commented not bothering to look up you do ernie was upset well well why did nt you say something you did nt ask sterno was considering something ernie had said few moments earlier what makes you think the flintstones is nt typical of the stone age ernie dropped into chair this was getting to be to much for him he thought the more he argued about all of this the more he seemed to be losing ground he was nt even sure what point he was losing ground on ernie decided to try another approach okay give up you tell me then what is going on oh you want to know what going on said the captain brightly he always enjoyed telling stories why did nt you say so well he went on warming up to his subject all of this is totally artificial it was put here to be trap that what was trying to tell you cried ernie excitedly it trap knew it captain memory was annoyed do you want to hear this or do you want to talk sorry ernie shut up where was captain memory gathered his thoughts oh yes anyway this is part of game called the flintstones in which fred and barney thwart an attempt by aliens to take over the earth back in the stone age it really quite elaborate an excellent game sterno added ve played it myself anyway captain memory continued this house is actually trap set by the aliens to try to capture earth people we knew that but we thought we come in here anyway because it more comfortable than cave do nt you think aha cried sterno what ernie was startled cigars sterno had found stone jar and opened it he pulled out cigar and examined it sniffing it carefully theyre not very good but suppose they ll have to do one must after all make allowances in the stone age he lit one puffing little clouds of blue smoke into the air captain memory returned to the tv guide so what about these aliens ernie inquired what do they want oh do nt know typical alien stuff imagine take me to your leader conquer the world steal your brain you know all that stuff aliens always do ernie was mystified but why oh do nt know probably from watching old science fiction movies on tv the aliens seem to think that sort of thing is expected of them ernie was nt following this watching tv aliens watch tv of course captain memory went on you have to expect something like that to happen after all we ve been beaming those radio and television waves out into outer space for years it was only matter of time until someone picked them up do you realize that there are civilizations forty light years from here that are now watching 1950 situation comedies what do you suppose they think of that well ernie began did you ever think that they might consider it hostile act captain memory continued animatedly they might think having love lucy reruns beamed at them is an act of war huh ernie was nt following this too well well look at it from their point of view captain memory explained here they are they come home from hard day at well whatever it is they do they just wan na watch little tv you know so they flip on their set and what do they get mr ed the flintstones love lucy they do nt wan na watch this they wan na watch you know alien shows ernie considered this love lucy huh well can see their point so maybe they decide to flip on the stereo captain memory continued and what do they get the chiffons the ronettes chuck berry maybe they do nt like rock roll did you ever think of that no ernie was amazed thought everybody liked rock roll captain memory shook his head sadly you ca nt take anything for granted in outer space ernie found this disturbing maybe it was nt such good idea to let all those tv waves get out into space then probably not agreed captain memory but it too late now we ll just have to deal with the consequences ernie did nt like that word consequences he would rather not think about what the consequences of all of this might be he rubbed his head he especially did nt like that steal your brain business so what are we gon na do ernie wanted to know do repeated captain memory distantly he had returned to reading ernie heard shout far in the distance he strained his ears there it was again it sounded like yabbadabbadoo look think we ought to get out of here ernie pleaded think something bad is gon na happen if we do nt leave like right now oh my what coincidence cried captain memory what now ernie asked uneasily you ll never guess what on and here we were talking about almost that very thing just moment ago ernie had bad feeling about this not that right returned captain memory jovially truth or consequences really do nt wan na watch but it was too late captain memory had already flipped on the set the set came on and here our host the announcer was saying that fabulous frenchman henri gruyere this is nt the truth or consequences remember said ernie suspiciously as usual noone was listening gut efening ladies und gentlemen the host was saying he was an unpleasantlooking man wearing traditional french outfit redstriped shirt scarf beret the only things that seemed bit out of place were his monocle and jackboots first of all he continued vould like to point out dot am french am not german not at all not efen little bit wait minute said sterno suspiciously something smells here hmm captain memory looked up unconcernedly think about it cried sterno do nt you realize his name gruyere it cheese but it was as usual too late sudden brightness dazzled ernie eyes as his vision cleared he found himself standing on gameshow stage with captain memory and sterno beside him he blinked and staggered disoriented by the sudden change of scene he moaned and held his head until the sickening swimming sensation stopped ernie looked up he was facing the audience he noticed something odd about the people watching oh that it he thought they re all wearing nazi uniforms thought you said this could nt happen he said to captain memory accusingly thought you said there was milliontoone chance of us getting sucked in through tv again captain memory shrugged so was wrong he admitted so sue me the game shoe host turned to the threesome perhaps you vould like to step through door number three the host said to them ernie turned around number of very nice prizes were displayed on the stage red sports car furniture some shiny new appliances several very attractive women in cutdown outfits were standing around the stage unfortunately they all carried guns which they held trained on ernie and the others captain memory was replying to the talk show host no do nt think we would care to step through door number three thanks just the same the talk show host laughed unpleasantly vould strongly recommend dot you step through door number three he said urgently no we really rather not answered the captain pleasantly the host face darkened you vill shtep through dat door now the women fingers tightened menacingly on their triggers oh well if you put it that way the three of them found themselves prodded towards door number three the door opened in front of them and they found themselves thrust into blackness the door slammed behind them with resounding crash ernie blinked as his eyes began to adjust he could see that the room they were in was not entirely dark small amount of light came in from barred window high up on the opposite wall they were in large chamber with damp stone walls and dirt floor it seemed to be dungeon oh great ernie muttered so this is what behind door number three it could ve been worse said captain memory jovially oh yeah ernie returned glumly how it could ve been door number four so what the big deal about door number four oh captain memory shook his head you do nt ever want to go behind door number four ernie did nt like the sound of that so what is it it the worst captain memory went on ominously mean it just too horrible voice came from out of the darkness hi guys ernie was taken aback it had nt occurred to him that someone else might be in the dungeon with them figure approached from out of the darkness ernie gasped it was horrendous creature with the body of human but the tremendously enlarged head of fly complete with huge faceted eyes antennae and long trunklike snout it was wearing rather nice designer suit say the creature continued have any of you guys seen my date ernie stared soundlessly captain memory shrugged sorry the creature sighed she seemed like such nice girl too the creature shuffled back and forth scuffing his expensive designer shoes in the dirt ernie peered at the creature he did nt seem to be menacing at all quite the contrary in fact he seemed quite unhappy but then again ernie thought it kind of hard to read expressions on fly aww that okay guys the fly said sadly you do nt have to tell me can figure it out she took off right he sighed just like all the others poor guy ernie thought his date stood him up ernie could sympathize he been in situations like that himself of course this guy did have an unusual problem know the fly continued it my looks right his antennae drooped sadly one little accident and there goes your whole social life ernie felt awkward what was he expected to say in situation like this nothing apparently for the fly went on mean ve got nice personality intelligent fun guy you know got good job nice car paid lotta money for this suit he fingered the expensive silk lapels but girls nowadays do they care naw all they care about is looks the fly continued animatedly he really seemed to appreciate the opportunity to get all of this off his chest mean go into bar you know not one of those sleazy places but nice singles spot where the drinks cost like five bucks each you know figure maybe can meet some nice girls here so see some cute chick try to start up conversation and like does she even give me chance hell no mean she does nt even wait to find out like what im all about or anything it just gasp scream faint gasp scream faint the same old thing over and over again mean what kind of way is that to behave do nt girls have any manners anymore he sighed looks all they care about is looks gee that too bad ernie really did nt know what to say thanks guy the fly answered really appreciate it do nt get to talk to too many people around here you know disturbing thought occurred to ernie is this guy okay he whispered to captain memory mean he not an alien or anything is he oh no laughed captain memory he the fly you saw the movie did nt you well yeah admitted ernie but thought it was well movie you see replied captain memory told you it could be worse at least you re trapped in cyperspace as yourself hes trapped as the fly ernie had to admit that the captain was right about that still it did nt make him fell much better anyway continued captain memory looking at the fly the aliens are much prettier say said sterno to the fly you would nt happen to have cigar on you by any chance would you sure guy the fly pulled out an expensive gold cigar case and flipped it open sterno removed cigar and examined it lovely he seemed very pleased havana no less thanks ever so much hey my pleasure the fly seemed to enjoy the opportunity to show off his finequality things it seemed to ernie that the fly had gone to lot of trouble to get the best of everything but did nt have much opportunity to impress people with it are we going to be leaving here soon sterno inquired of captain memory it is awfully damp in here and it rather bothers my sinuses ernie shivered the dampness was getting to him too wearing only loincloth as he was he had little protection from the chill hey like the loincloth guy the fly said to ernie that the new in thing right maybe ll get one you think the girls would go for it ernie did nt know how to reply well guess there no point in hanging around here much longer captain memory decided after all there no tv you guys gon na leave the fly seemed crestfallen or perhaps antennafallen but you just got here he brightened hey you guys are gon na go someplace fun right can come huh can well captain memory began do you know how we can get out of here sterno inquired hey no problem answered the fly you can take the 515 out of laguardia and that ll get you there in about oh two hours forty minutes but if you want the special rate you got ta stay from sunday through saturday but not any mondays or you can take the 625 out of ohare but then you got ta what about the door ernie broke in oh the fly was disappointed he enjoyed showing off his detailed knowledge of travel arrangements yeah well theres always the door ernie looked at the door it was made of heavy steel and seemed to be secure bolted so how do we open it just knock the fly seemed to think this was all too simple and therefore not very much fun ernie knocked he heard the sound of bolt being thrown back and the door creaked open outside were two burly guards in black nazi ss uniforms ja uh is it okay if we go now ernie asked brightly nein the door slammed oh not like that the fly seemed impatient you got ta use like subterfuge you know here ll show you the fly was pleased to have another opportunity to show off his expertise at something he knocked on the door the door creaked open again ja got ta go to the bathroom the fly said urgently the guards looked at each other vhat are ve supposed to do now dey did nt tell us vhat to do if dis happened they looked hesitant vell do nt know do nt tink so sensing failure the fly quickly switched tactics hey look he cried pointing past the guards naked lady vhere vhere cried the guards peering into the distance the fly threw his entire weight against the door which flew open run he cried to the others he sprinted toward center stage followed by ernie sterno and captain memory startled von liederkranz was on center stage trying to flirt with the chorus girls guards he cried do nt let dem get avay he grabbed the nearest weapon which in this case happened to be an alien blaster of unknown properties he aimed it at the foursome who were sprinting towards door marked exit shtop or ll shoot von liederkranz threatened the four continued to run von liederkranz pulled the trigger huge ball of magnetogravitational energy flashed from the muzzle of the blaster instantly hurtling ernie and the others into totally different spacetime continuum von liederkranz looked ruefully at the blaster and then at the smoking hole in the stage where the foursome had been only nanosecond earlier vell von liederkranz admitted perhaps dot vas nt der best veapon to use chapter ernie captain memory sterno and the fly sat on rocky crag overlooking lifeless purple sea they watched the waves crash against the rocks beneath them ernie sighed so where are we now well as far as can figure out said captain memory thoughtfully we seem to have been blasted back to somewhere on the order of four billion bc life has not evolved yet on earth huh said ernie you mean we traveled in time of course not the captain replied what really happened is that we got sent to another sector of cyberspace probably by accident captain memory looked around after all ca nt see any reason for von liederkranz to have sent us here on purpose ernie looked out over the purple waves so where are we mean really captain memory thought moment we re probably in somebodys geology program you know like computer models of primeval earth he looked at the barren landscape while we did nt actually travel in time it almost as if we did this is like actually being on earth at the beginning of life wow thought ernie that really cosmic the fly looked at the bare rocks around them you know man this place is like really dead exactly captain memory agreed mean the fly went on there is like no girls none at all that right so like what good is it captain memory thought moment good question ernie watched the orange sun in green sky which was slowly setting against purple sea this is really weird scene he commented have never seen anything like this not even on tv he thought about that for moment not even on tv why that could mean that there no tv captain memory agreed not much reason to stay here then is there ernie noticed motion out of the corner of his eye not sure you ought to throw those cigar butts on the ground here he said to sterno sterno looked annoyed why in the world not well do nt know that much about this ernie said but it seems to me read somewhere that the further you go back in time the more effect your actions have on the future therefore if we make even little changes way back here in four billion bc it might have some kind of real big effect by the time we get back to our own time utterly ridiculous scoffed sterno flicking cigar ash into the sea this is nt really four billion bc it only computer model of four billion bc well yeah ernie admitted uneasily but the captain said that this was almost the same as really being there and dunno just have real bad feeling about those cigar butts really sterno looked totally bored just ca nt tell you how concerned that makes me he yawned well well just do nt think it good idea that all well you know how it goes said captain memory jovially it all just six of one twelve dozen of another ernie frowned do nt think that right is nt it oh well said captain memory cheerily math was never one of my strong points anyway no time to worry about that now let be off shall we he though moment let try some machine language 010f e4 61 the scene vanished the foursome found themselves standing in the middle of road in bright sunlight once again ernie blinked and staggered his stomach doing flipflops as his vision cleared he could see around him what appeared to be an idyllic country scene rustic rail fence bordered the road beyond the fence stood farms surrounded by fields full of amber waves of grain in the distance stood majestic purple mountains ernie turned around behind them lay broad plain ernie was pretty sure there was fruit on it wonder where we are the fly asked sterno looked around kansas he suggested ernie began to get that queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach again look down confirmed his worst fears the road was yellow brick do nt think like this said ernie warily sterno rolled his eyes upward you never like anything ernie tried to explain well you see know know sterno interrupted you have really bad feeling about this you ve seen it all before you think it trap ernie thought moment well yeah sterno sighed you know this is all becoming really tiresome do so wish you find something else to go on about ernie thought moment suddenly he smiled broadly hey get it this is all really just game right sterno moaned not that again even captain memory looked annoyed the fly was confused like what is this guy talking about he asked captain memory the captain just rolled his eyes upward and made little spinning motions around his temple with his forefinger oh wow the fly went on so is this guy like crazy or what well you know how it is captain memory explained not unsympathetically some people just do nt deal well with travel it too stressful for them it upsets their systems oh wow said the fly compassionately poor guy ernie was annoyed awright you guys knock it off okay mean enough is enough all right actually he thought there was probably quite bit of truth to what captain memory had been saying the stress probably was upsetting his system however even if he agreed with what the captain had to say he resented his tone of voice so like what are we gon na do now guys the fly wanted to know well the captain began jovially guess we ll just have to follow the do nt say it ernie broke in okay just do nt say it touchy touchy sniffed sterno captain memory was somewhat taken aback well have it your way let go that way he gestured down the road the fly shook his head shoulda known anybody who wear loincloth like that he noticed ernie glaring at him and stopped hey no offense he shrugged ernie scowled they began walking down the road ernie peered ahead far ahead down the road he seemed to see something large and green big and green ernie thought is that the emerald suddenly ernie had an idea he stopped clicked his heels together three times clenched his eyes tightly shut and said there no place like home there no place like home there no place like home he opened his eyes the other three were standing around him staring what is wrong with you sterno demanded ernie was acutely aware of everyone watching him having bad day okay he said defensively just leave me alone he began walking forward again quickly my are nt we sensitive today sterno said snidely the fly shook his head sadly the human mind is such fragile thing they proceeded down the road the green object in the distance began to resolve itself into some kind of building ernie continued to be very unhappy about the entire situation but decided he was sick of being made fun of and said nothing they approached the green building it was done in greek revival style with huge classical columns in the front hey its bank noticed the fly do you suppose can cash check the letters carved into the greekstyle pediment of the building did in fact identify it as bank ernie was confused he had nt expected to find bank here why would there be bank here ernie asked incredulously captain memory regarded the building looks like we might have run into piece of somebody business program accounting or bank operations or something he shook his head that what happens when you start sticking bunch of unrelated systems together you never know what you re going to wind up with they proceeded up the long marble stairway and entered the bank the interior was huge and very ornate done in victorian style everything seemed antique as though the bank were right out of the 19th century they walked up to row of teller windows each of which was protected by elaborate victorian grillwork the fly pulled very nice quality leather checkbook out of his suit pocket hey he said to the teller rather prim looking young woman can you cash check sorry we ca nt she did nt really seem to be sorry at all we ca nt do anything right now our computers are down ernie looked around he saw men at high desks carefully copying numbers with long quill pens nowhere was there any sign of electricity much less computers you do nt have any computers ernie said suspiciously the teller expression turned ugly well we re still not going to cash your check she snapped why not the fly wanted to know we ca nt do any business our our accountant has gone crazy she concluded triumphantly ernie looked at the teller suspiciously something very peculiar was going on here however he decided not to say anything about it because he did nt want to be made fun of wan na talk to the manager the fly decided good the teller sneered the manager would like to talk to all of you right now the teller came out from behind the counter and led them all into room which looked very much like bank office there behind very large desk sat disagreeablelooking old woman with sour expression ernie somehow knew that the woman had something unpleasant in mind for them well it about time she snapped as they entered the room there little matter of an unpaid balance to be taken care of ernie looked at the woman she was wearing severely tailored grey suit with her greying hair pulled back in tight bun for some reason however she was wearing shoes that did nt match her outfit they were brilliant sparkling red the fly approached the desk hey got this check just one minute the manager cut him off rudely there little matter to be taken care of first she pulled out sheaf of papers we have an invoice here for time continuum repair and reality maintenance which was referred to our department for non payment which of you is going to take care of this matter sterno was becoming impatient what are you talking about the manager began reading from the papers it seems there was little problem with cigars butts left at four billion bc ernie glared at sterno who looked innocently off into the air twiddling his thumbs it seems these foreign materials left at such an early point caused slime creatures to evolve into the dominant life form on earth precluding this disgusting development required maintenance order which took let me see she flipped through the pages and pulled out sheet marked work order here it is one million two hundred and fiftytwo thousand and three standard earth years and fortyfive minutes now at 3975 per hour plus timeandahalf for overtime and doubletime on sundays that comes to she flipped through some more pages one hundred and ninetyfive quadrillion four hundred and twelve trillion seven hundred and seventyone billion two hundred and thirteen million three hundred and twelve thousand and thirtytwo dollars and twentynine cents she peered at captain memory would you like to take care of this balance at this time captain memory shrugged do nt look at me do nt have any money the manager peered at the fly who looked uncomfortable hey sorry but got obligations you know got car payments got ta pay the rent he trailed off the bank manager looked at ernie ernie laughed this was all just too ridiculous sure put it on my charge he said flippantly the bank manager smiled maliciously mr ernest ross she said in an disagreeable tone of voice carefully writing his name on the invoice with quill pen captain memory looked at ernie horrified oh you shouldnt have said that he said in an ominous tone ernie began to get the feeling that maybe he had made big mistake the bank manager looked up at him now when may we expect payment ernie looked desperately to the others they were all pointedly ignoring him look he said urgently forget said that okay take it back oh sorry she said in tone of malicious sweetness afraid you ca nt do that now will you be paying in cash or by check hundred and ninetyfive quadrillion dollars said the fly wonderingly that lot of money that more than make in week ernie was beginning to panic no wo nt forget it not going to pay that bill you ll pay this bill my fine little friend the bank manager cackled or ll take care of you she looked at sterno and your little dog too she laughed nastily what witch the fly commented suddenly ernie had brilliant idea he grabbed vase of flowers off the desk yanked the flowers out of it and threw the water all over the bank manager eeyah she screamed all wet the fly looked at ernie wonderingly why in the world did you do that ernie looked at the bank manager she was glaring and hissing at him water dripping off her face she was not melting at all ernie became uncomfortably aware of everyone staring at him uh well thought ernie stuttered you ll have to excuse our friend captain memory adlibbed quickly it the stress you see financial problems he not coping the three began hustling ernie towards the door the bank manager arose hissing and spitting you havent heard the last of this she shrieked you ll see the four rushed quickly through the bank and back out onto the road the stopped to get their bearings well hope you re satisfied sterno said contemptuously to ernie you ve really made mess of things now me cried ernie hey not the one who left those cigar butts back in four billion bc it not my fault oh sure sterno interrupted try and blame it on me hey guys the fly broke in look at that the fly huge multifaceted eyes had picked up detail the others had failed to notice behind the bank was small flat roofed brick building neon sign proclaimed deer bar there was large picture of deer beneath it hey guys it bar the fly continued whaddya say we stop in for drink hey maybe we can meet some girls the others looked at each others confusedly hey it okay guys the fly went on ll buy captain memory looked relieved well in that case sure thanks they all started towards the bar ernie was finding all of this very confusing every time he thought he was beginning to understand what was going on events took turn in an entirely different direction was nt this supposed to be the emerald city he did nt recall any bars in the emerald city and what about that bank and what happened to judy garland they entered the bar well ernie thought not sure if this is good idea or not but could really use drink ernie found the interior of the bar reassuring it was cool and dark it looked like typical corner bar with typical corner bartender in one corner behind the bar tv set was mounted but luckily it was turned off there were few other customers in the place but of course business was always kind of slow in the middle of the day they seated themselves at the bar they bartender portly balding man smoking cigar came up to them what ll you have what kind of beer you got the fly wanted to know deer deer the fly was puzzled deer beer the bartender stated matteroffactly this is the deer bar we got deer beer you want it or not uh yeah okay the fly replied somewhat confused uh three deer beers ernie looked at the fly it occurred to him that noone around here seemed at all disturbed by the fly looks that seemed to bit odd he would have expected the fly to have attracted somewhat more attention but then on the other hand ernie thought it probably did nt mean anything after all everything is pretty strange around here ernie appreciated the opportunity to relax and have beer the fly pointed into the darkness at the far end of the bar hey get load of that babe he said to ernie his antennae waving excitedly ernie peered intently he could just barely see in the dim light rather disreputablelooking young woman with bleached blond hair and skimpy outfit perched on stool at the far end of the bar what your name dear the fly called out to her bambi she replied the fly was encouraged hey whaddya say we cost you bucks she interrupted the fly antennae drooped dispiritedly how come there are nt any nice girls around anymore he turned back to his beer sterno looked about worriedly he sniffed something smells very peculiar around here probably just onions ernie was unconcerned hardly sniffed sterno there is something seriously wrong about this place now who paranoid ernie dismissed sterno fears just then the door to the bar opened and woman walked in she had flaming red hair and was wearing 1950sstyle party dress hi there fellas she said loudly hi the fly jumped up his antennae waving excitedly say can buy you drink sure she answered in brassy voice ernie looked at the woman not my type he thought too loud he looked at her again something about her seemed very familiar ernie was sure he had seen her before but he could nt quite remember where gee she said to the fly you sure are differentlooking where are you from the fly thought quickly uh france oh sure know france the woman answered brightly ooh lala cestlavie eiffel tower right sure you got it the fly whispered aside to the others oh boy oh boy really getting somewhere now he turned back to the woman so like what your name lucy she answered loudly the door opened again and swarthy man with slickedback black hair entered he was wearing cuban shirt with huge ruffled sleeves and carrying pair of maracas the woman gestured towards the man and this is my husband ricky aww the fly antennae drooped how you do said the man with heavy spanish accent im ricky ricardo de famous cuban bandleader he shook his maracas rhythmically chickaboom chickaboom yeah hi the fly answered glumly he turned to the others would nt you know she married he was obviously deeply disappointed he brightened bit say he said to lucy you would nt happen to have any girlfriends you could ask over do you friends said lucy shrilly sure got friends in fact couple of them are on there way over right now the fly was thrilled oh boy oh boy his antennae waved excitedly he turned to ricky hey like the shirt guy its the new in thing right chure ricky agreed ees de latest style in habana the door opened and in walked an older couple also dressed in 1950 styles oh said lucy here my friends now fellas this is fred and ethel mertz aww the fly was disappointed these were nt the type of friends he had been hoping for sterno leaned forward there is something terribly wrong with these people he said to ernie and the captain can smell it leave me alone said ernie he had nt forgiven sterno for blaming the bank problem on him all these people looked terribly familiar to ernie suddenly he had it ve got it he shouted the fly was more mystified than ever now he got it what is it contagious he edged away from ernie slightly no not that said ernie impatiently just remembered it love lucy lucy put her hand on ernie arm love you too she said she edged closer now that we re friends like to ask you little favor what asked ernie suspiciously it just little thing she began hesitantly what he edged away uncomfortably we just like to borrow it just for little while well bring it right back what ernie was getting impatient um lucy seemed bit embarrassed we like to borrow your brain my brain shrieked ernie we just want to borrow it said lucy quickly just for little while we re not going to steal it lucy laughed nervously no ernie cried really you do nt have anything to worry about lucy continued we re not going to take it back to our home planet or anything and we re certainly not going to put it into giant killer robot and use it to take over the earth she laughed we would never do that she turned to ricky and the mertz would we oh no they all laughed we never do that never there that proves it lucy concluded so how about it she reached towards ernie head no ernie screamed leaping off the bar stool keep your hands off my brain he whipped out his plastic broadsword and brandished it menacingly after standing there few moments ernie became aware of everyone looking at him very peculiarly hey guy the fly inquired like what are you gon na do with that plastic sword ernie could hear the sound of muffled laughter but he could nt tell where it was coming from ernie glowered okay okay he said replacing the sword in it sheath just keep your hands off my brain all right lucy frowned she looked at sterno and then looked at her companions dog brain she asked them they all shook their heads no she looked at the fly fly brain she asked ricky and the mertz nope they shook their heads she looked at captain memory she smiled broadly wonder if could ask you favor she began no chance captain memory cut her off her expression became ugly extremely ugly in fact thought ernie she was changing into just about the ugliest thing ernie had ever seen lucy snarled revealing rows of pointed reptilian looking teeth and forked tongue foolish earth creatures she hissed pulling out frighteninglooking weapon you will turn your brains over to us or we will destroy this miserable planet of yours who are these people ernie whispered to captain memory remember told you about those aliens captain memory asked ernie nodded well here they are hey guys what do we do now the fly asked ernie and captain memory looking at lucy weapon uneasily captain memory looked up brightly hey he said to lucy and her companions wan na watch some tv lucy and the other aliens were totally confused watch tv do nt remember that is that in the script what are we supposed to do they looked at each other confusedly oh wow look what on before anyone could stop him captain memory had reached behind the bar and turned on the tv it time for wheel of torture chapter an image of sturmbannfuhrer dr heinz von liederkranz filled the screen vis us tonight he began ve haff our contestants from our last show he turned to introduce them first captain memory captain memory bowed to polite applause from the audience goombah de barbarian ernie blinked and staggered once again he suddenly found himself on the game show stage his stomach flipped over once again he hated these abrupt changes of scene not again he moaned captain memory shrugged hey that show biz the audience was staring at ernie they seemed to be expecting something he smiled and waved halfheartedly the audience tittered and applauded weakly ernie noticed that the audience was still made up entirely of nazis he sighed he might have known he would wind up back here he thought whatever the worst thing is that could possibly happen that what will happen ernie frowned in fact this was even the worst thing that could nt possibly happen and it was happening anyway was nt that against murphy law or something anyway it was all very confusing von liederkranz turned to the other side of the stage ernie noticed that the aliens had been transported onto the game show as well and were now staggering and blinking just like ernie und tonight ve have vith us special guests von liederkranz said gesturing towards the aliens with his riding crop lucy and ricky ricardo the famous cuban bandleader and their friends fred and ethel mertz thunderous applause greeted the introduction the aliens were utterly confused chickaboom asked ricky shaking his maracas feebly the mertz drew alien weapons pointing them in all directions uncertainly und now ze big question von liederkranz said to the aliens vill you take vot in dis bag he held up small paper bag which looked lot like somebody lunch or try for vots behind door number four the audience was hushed with anticipation the aliens looked at each other in confusion what do we do was nt prepared for this do nt know what to do they told each other captain memory decided to help them out anyone with any brains would take what behind door number four he hinted the aliens brightened brains brains yes that it lets take what behind door number four they looked pleased chick aboom said ricky definitely door number four it is called out von liederkranz the audience roared it approval an attractive woman in chorusgirl outfit opened door number four and the aliens filed in looking very pleased as soon as the last alien was inside the door slammed with metallic crash the chorus girl reached over and daintily locked it immediately ernie began to hear the sounds of commotion coming from behind the door at first pounding then thuds then shrill bloodcurdling screams the screams continued for several minutes and then died away finally all was silent behind door number four the audience applauded vell von liederkranz announced jovially looks like dey got vot dey had coming to dem doesnt it he laughed he turned to ernie captain memory and the others ernie noticed that while their attention had been drawn elsewhere guards with machine guns had surrounded them shtill it vas very considerate of dem to find you for me he said with an evil gleam in his eye vas afraid ve had lost you forever after dat unfortunate incident vit de alien blaster von liederkranz turned to the guard nearest him for vhich you vill pay schweinhund he lashed the guard with his riding crop but herr doktor the guard protested vas nt even there shut up von liederkranz snapped he turned to captain memory und now perhaps ve vill continue vith ze questions ja he smiled sadistically you remember vhere ve left off vis ze hot vhirling corkscrew guard handed von liederkranz the bynowfamiliar diabolical looking device which began to glow and whirl von liederkranz smiled evilly he began slowly advancing toward captain memory with his device von liederkranz was disturbed by the sound of knock he looked around there it was again someone was knocking on the stage door von liederkranz was annoyed answer ze door dummkopf he snapped at one of the guards the guard opened the door mailman fellow in post office uniform walked in the door got special delivery letter here von liederkranz narrowed his eyes suspiciously for who is there mr ernest ross here uh that me ernie said here you go the mailman handed ernie letter everything stopped while ernie opened the letter von liederkranz and the nazis milled about confusedly ernie was totally mystified who could be sending him letter here nobody knew he was here and even if they did why would they send him letter here ernie tore the letter open and read dear mr ross we still have not received payment on your outstanding balance of 19541277121331203229 this account is now two billion years overdue do not force us to turn this matter over to collection agency send in your payment immediately before we are required to take further action sincerely first national bank of the west ps if you have already sent in your payment please disregard this notice ernie looked up von liederkranz was watching him very carefully ernie had an idea oops looks like got ta go pay bill see ya ernie started towards the door not so fast von liederkranz blocked ernie path give me dot letter he snatched it out of ernie hand der sturmbannfuhrer was very upset how dare they interrupt his game show to deliver letter and just exactly who was this message from anyway and what did it really mean von liederkranz examined the letter carefully zo he said thoughtfully you owe ze bank one hundred and ninetyfive quadrillion dollars just as we thought of course it wasnt really what he thought at all the nazi eyes narrowed zis one hundred and ninetyfive quadrillion dollars it is great deal of money ja ja mean yes agreed ernie it is more even than make in veek von liederkranz eyed ernie suspiciously zo how is it dot you come to owe zo much money well you see there was this problem with cigar butts two billion years ago ernie explained nervously he did nt like the nazi tone of voice and he particularly did nt like the hot whirling corkscrew and then we were at the bank and had to go and open my big mouth and so then schweinhund von liederkranz whipped ernie with the letter do you take me for fool noone could possibly owe zis much money obviously zis is some sort of secret code now who vould be sending you secret coded messages here on mein own game show ernie looked pleadingly at captain memory the captain just shrugged von liederkranz continued reflectively und how could zey know vhere to find you vis zis message unless he whirled to face his guards one of you is traitor nein nein the guards blanched and backed away von liederkranz looked at the audience or perhaps one of you nein nein the audience cried out in unison fidgeting uncomfortably in their seats von liederkranz advanced on the audience the hot whirling corkscrew spinning and glowing in his hand zo you vill not confess eh he shrieked at the audience perhaps taste of the corkscrew vill loosen your tongues ernie felt tap on his shoulder captain memory beckoned towards the back of the stage all eyes were riveted on von liederkranz and on the hissing spinning torture device in his hand noone was paying any attention to the foursome they tiptoed into the wings and back behind the stage as they left they began to hear screams coming from somewhere in the audience they hurried along the corridor leading to the dressing rooms backstage unfortunately there seemed to be no exits anywhere in that part of the building the only exits were through the main floor which would have required them to go back out onto the stage this did not seem like very good idea an empty dressing room beckoned ahead of them they hurried into it and locked the door behind them the screams were still audible inside the room hey guys the fly wanted to know like what are we gon na do now ernie sneezed wish they would nt keep the air conditioning turned up so high he complained shivering well if you re going to go around wearing nothing but that ridiculous fur loincloth you have to expect to get chill commented sterno unsympathetically we all feel lot better if you cover up some of that pallid skin of yours hey that an idea the fly chimed in this is dressing room maybe there some clothes here you can wear that seemed like good idea to ernie he been uncomfortably cold ever since he put that silly loincloth on he began looking through the closet but found only filmy negligees and haremgirl outfits hey there whole wardrobe room next door the fly pointed to an adjoining room take look in there ernie disappeared into the next room sterno was searching the room carefully whatcha looking for secret passages the fly asked eagerly actually was rather hoping someone might have left spot of brandy about he answered aha he pulled out bottle look of disappointment appeared on his face md 2020 he asked what in the world could that be oh wow commented the fly mad dog beg your pardon snapped sterno huffily hey no offense said the fly quickly that just what it called you know hmmph sterno opened the bottle and sniffed the contents dreadful he proclaimed and dropped the bottle in the trash ernie reappeared from the wardrobe room he was now clad in spanish toreador outfit consisting of scintillating gold suit covered with sequins with knee breeches and white stockings white shirt and tie and an oddshaped little black hat he noticed everyone looking at him oddly hey it was the only thing could find you know ernie said defensively at least it warm sterno sniffed must say you have the most awful taste in clothes but at least it better than looking at that sickening body of yours ernie was offended what wrong with my body sterno rolled his eyes upward silently only the fly seemed to approve of ernie new outfit hey guy he said enthusiastically like the suit it the new in thing right sterno regarded ernie critically why are you still carrying that ridiculous plastic broadsword ernie shifted uncomfortably hey told you it forty buck deposit sterno rolled his eyes upward hopeless ernie sat down in comfortablelooking chair he thought he had better take advantage of every opportunity to rest he had no way of knowing how long all of this craziness was going to continue so like what with that lucy chick the fly asked captain memory mean like what her problem oh she an alien explained the captain what you know the captain went on come from outer space invade the earth steal your brain that kinda stuff the captain made himself comfortable on small sofa and began leafing through his copy of the tv guide aliens ernie asked confusedly are they really aliens there as real as anything in cyberspace suppose the captain commented but what are they doing here ernie wanted to know they re part of game called menace from planet zero its quite popular the captain explained figured we run across it sooner or later with all the systems waldo been taking over the odds are that it be in at least one of them the fly seemed bit skeptical well gee that chick sure did nt look like an alien the captain was impatient she in disguise of course you would nt want to see what she really looks like he shuddered anyway he continued that whole bunch are aliens in disguise they ve been watching our 1950 tv shows and they think those tv characters are normal earth people they think if they disguise themselves as 1950 tv characters you earth people will never know the difference they do nt seem to be very smart ernie commented well you know said the captain thoughtfully intelligence is not the only way to approach reality there are other ways of thinking it possible to approach problemsolving from an entirely different perspective there are civilizations in which thinking is done in an entirely different way where intelligence is replaced by whole different way of looking at the universe ernie had never heard captain memory get so philosophical before so do these aliens have completely different way of thinking he asked wonderingly no said the captain reflectively they re just stupid he returned to his tv guide mighta known said the fly reflectively after all shes hanging out with that ricky guy man he something else anybody who wear shirt like that he trailed off looking sideways at ernie number of magazines were scattered about an end table next to ernie chair headline in one of the caught ernie eye fantastic archaeological find revealed ernie picked it up and began to read on october 16 1978 an arab shepherd following stray animal into cave near the sea of galilee made an incredible find find unparalleled in modern history find so monumental so earthshattering so threatening to world governments and religious institutions that its very existence has been suppressed only now by means of smuggled documents obtained at great personal risk to all involved can this fabulous story come to light the story of the dead sea phonograph records ernie was intrigued he read on our story must really begin in ancient egypt deep in the mysteries of the middle kingdom an age which produced some of the greatest wonders the world has even seen some of these like the pyramids have been known to the world for millennia yet it stands to reason that any people capable of producing wonders like these wonders which the modern world has yet to equal must also have been capable of producing many other amazing things on smaller scale yet all of these have been lost in the sands of time or have they let us consider for moment the phonograph relatively simple device invented in the last century by thomas edison in its basic form it consists of disc or even cylinder driven by crank that comes in contact with needle attached to cone one can then either play or record simply by turning the crank and either speaking into the cone or listening that all there is to it simple device like this can be made with almost anyone with basic tools it could have been made thousands of years ago it could even have been made by the ancient egyptians certainly any civilization capable of producing incredible engineering feats like the pyramids would be capable of constructing simple mechanical device like this now there is evidence that they did in the tomb of the pharaoh pepto ii at bismol hieroglyphics have been found which bear an uncanny resemblance to edison early phonographs along with these were others which were translated to read and the voice of the pharaoh shall speak on after he is gone and fragment missing that we who are as dogs to the mighty pharaoh shall listen to our master voice ernie looked at the accompanying illustration it was picture from an egyptian tomb showing dog listening to some kind of device with cone coming out of it it reminded ernie of something did nt it look lot like the rca victor logo then again maybe not he continued reading but this is only the beginning it would be monumental enough if records of the voices of the pharaohs had been found but what has actually been discovered is so spectacular as to make the pharaohs seem trivial by comparison it was of course phonograph records that the arab shepherd found they were in the form of discs made of fine clay material much more durable than the perishable vinyl that our presentday phonograph records are made of and were packed in the crumbling remains of an egyptianstyle case when played at approximately 78 rpm they produced voices much like our own early phonograph records but stop and consider these records were found deep in israel near the sea of galilee in other words nowhere near the egypt of the pharaohs there is no evidence that the phonograph was ever used in ancient israel what more they were in an egyptian style case and bore egyptian markings how could they have come to cave near the sea of galilee there is only one way they must have been brought there from egypt by the fleeing israelites hieroglyphics prove that the phonograph was in existence at this time what would have been more reasonable than for the fleeing israelites taking with them the treasures of egypt to take with them this great treasure but what would they have used it for what else but for the same use as the pharaohs to record and preserve the voice of their leader so that his will can be known forever the voice of moses yet if this device the phonograph was in the hands of moses would nt he have used it to record the things he considered of greatest importance in that case would nt he have taken it to mount sinai would nt he have used it to record the voice of god himself now you can see why this find has been suppressed why no government no religious institution on earth can afford to let these records be heard they contain at the very least the voice of moses and possibly even the very voice of god there may be things on these records which could change the life of every man woman and child on earth now today in the 20th century but will these records ever be heard or will they be hidden away in secret vault kept from world that needs them so desperately they must be heard the people have right to this knowledge knowledge which affects each and every one of them in every facet of their daily lives right now there is no way of knowing where they are being held or by whom or for what purpose but find like this can not be suppressed it is to earthshaking too monumental word will leak out people will be told already this has begun to happen secret documents have been smuggled out incontrovertible evidence has been uncovered it is beginning now it is only mater of time before the world learns the awesome truth about the dead sea phonograph records ernie put the magazine down wow he thought this is really heavy is this for real or is this just more crazy nonsense did this really happen or is this just more garbage caused by sticking together too many computer programs that do nt belong together how can we tell the difference ernie thought about the problem this is an important question he decided we may have stumbled onto something really meaningful somebody ought to look into this somebody ought to find out whether this is for real or not because if it is real it might be really important ernie stopped he had nt the vaguest idea how somebody would go about looking into question like this ernie looked at captain memory here look at this article he handed the magazine to the captain the captain peered at the article the dead sea phonograph records get real captain memory tossed the magazine over his shoulder no really ernie protested this is important stuff really think you should consider it what if this really happened what if this is like secret cia computer file or something mean stuff like that could be here right it possible isnt it aything possible the captain admitted but how likely is it ernie heard snickering coming from behind him he turned sterno had picked up the magazine and was leafing through it you actually read this stuff laughed sterno here good article princess diana says carrying elvis baby or how about was raped by killer lesbians from outer space ernie frowned something about that last headline sounded little familiar sterno continued here another one earth invaded by aliens disguised as 1950 tv characters hey lem me see that ernie reached for the magazine convinced that they were onto something what trash sterno dropped the magazine in the wastebasket hey ernie fished through the wastebasket trying to retrieve the magazine oh no it all covered with sticky wine the pages are all stuck together wow man said the fly wonderingly that really heavy stuff imagine that princess diana pregnant with elvis baby never knew that ernie was trying to separate the pages of the magazine but the mad dog wine had dissolved most of the ink and he was only succeeding in making big mess did you really think you were going to find the secrets of the universe in that magazine asked sterno sarcastically do nt think you re going to get anywhere with that stuff added captain memory think you re barking up the wrong tree suppose you think that funny sterno snarled he regarded ernie for moment you know that little hat looks really ridiculous yeah guy the fly chimed in how come you re wearing that mickey mouse hat it not mickey mouse hat alright said ernie frustrated it part of the outfit you re supposed to wear this kind of little hat dunno why you re just supposed to ernie sulked leave me alone sterno chuckled the only good thing about having him along he said gesturing at ernie is that he can always cheer me up if did nt have him to laugh at do nt know what do ernie glowered the fly was sitting at dressing table regarding himself in the mirror he kept examining various bottle of cosmetics holding each in turn up to his face but he could nt find any that matched his shell tone my what big eyes you have quipped sterno how about some eyeliner or maybe some mascara for your antenna aw cmon guys the fly complained gim me break huh was just looking for little like bronzer yknow ythink bronzer would look good on me his antennae waved hopefully ernie was feeling irritable he was tired of everyone picking on him all the time why do you keep reading that tv guide he snapped at captain memory so can see what on answered the captain reasonably how can you possibly tell what on when you do nt even know where we are you re never gon na have the right listings for here wherever this is sure do disagreed the captain ve got the listings for everywhere how could you have that ernie was skeptical this is the intercontinuum edition with multigalactic sub listings for the week of may 3infinity explained the captain it got the listings for all of time and space lem me see that ernie snatched it rudely out of captain memory hand why the pages are all blank are you subscriber the captain wanted to know gently taking the book back out of ernie hands well no ernie admitted well that why you ca nt see it ernie sighed he guessed that made as much sense as anything else cm examined the listings carefully wan na watch an old movie here classic mr blandings builds his dream horse ernie frowned you mean house captain memory was puzzled mr house builds his dream horse ernie shook his head no no it supposed to be mr blandings builds his dream house captain memory peered at the tv guide it quite clearly says here horse that ridiculous ernie insisted you ca nt build horse that right the fly chimed in at least not without permit huh ernie was taken aback and an inspection the fly went on mean you wouldnt want to ride horse that was built without permit and wasnt inspected it would nt be safe uh something about this did nt sound right to ernie the fly continued with enthusiasm mean like what if you took this horse out on the freeway you know and you re cruisin along doin maybe 60 and all of sudden boom leg falls off then what somebody could get hurt ernie did nt know how to argue with this uh suppose you re right he fell silent captain memory broke the silence hey here good show 830 follow the yellow brick road the fab four stop for drink at the deer bar and meet aliens disguised as 1950 tv characters starring lucille ball adam west and rintintin how about that sounds okay to me said the fly agreeably ernie looked around the room there no tv he said triumphantly oh there always tv the captain assured him okay where ernie demanded hmm captain memory looked around he got up walked over to the dressing table and peered into the mirror let try this mirror mirror on the wall ai nt there no tv at all the surface of the mirror dissolved and an image of the deer bar appeared in its place four characters were seated at the bar drinking beer so what are we gon na do now guys asked the fly sipping beer through his long flexible snout ernie started and looked about confusedly they were suddenly all back at the deer bar his stomach flipped over again what uh how did we get back here same way we got out said captain memory gesturing towards the tv set he looked momentarily confused either that or maybe we never really left at all forget which oh well it doesnt really matter ernie looked up at the television above the bar which now was turned on sadistic nazi talk show host was using diabolical looking device to torture members of the audience uh do you mind if turn that off asked ernie if you like answered the captain indifferently ernie switched off the set and breathed sigh of relief now they were safe he frowned well maybe they were nt safe but they were safer he thought about it moment well maybe they werent really any safer but turning the tv off made him feel better just the same that satisfied him so he returned to his seat the fly looked around like we re the only ones here uh huh ernie agreed so what happened to like ricky and lucy as if in answer the door to the bar flew open and in staggered ricky his ruffled cuban shirt in rags his maracas broken close behind him was lucy her hair disarrayed her party dress torn and smeared with dirt you feelthy peeg shrieked ricky enraged you send us behind door numero four keel you what did he say the fly asked confusedly cant understand his accent at all think he said he was going to keel us sterno volunteered what that the fly wanted to know something to do with boats ricky advanced on the foursome holding his shattered maracas menacingly ernie noticed that they seemed to have acquired very sharp edges keel you cut your brain out he threatened ernie hey he starting up with that brain stuff again ernie said to captain memory what do we do have beer said captain memory sipping his deer beer that easy for you to say it not your brain he after ernie looked at ricky apprehensively why do nt you just let him have your brain snickered sterno you ll never miss it ricky slowly staggered forward ernie noticed that ricky was getting much more sort of reptilianlooking he seemed to have acquired long sharp teeth and forked tongue which flitted in and out of his mouth in snakelike manner hey uh should nt we uh do something ernie urged captain memory the captain looked annoyed oh all right he cleared his throat and now he announced pompously word from our sponsor ricky froze oh ees commercial he said to lucy we got to wait well guess we better get going fellas captain memory said to the other three we ve only got sixty seconds he gulped down the rest of his beer hate to drink beer in hurry it upsets my stomach he burped he brushed past ricky and lucy who were frozen into state of immobility and led the group out the door once outside captain memory checked his bare wrist hmm ten more seconds know let try this the captain led the group around the side of the building where they could not be seen from the main door fifteen seconds later ricky and lucy burst out of the bar door where dey go ricky screamed dey not suppose to move during de commercial dey got to wait for de show to start again ricky and lucy looked quickly around and then charged off down the road in the direction of the bank the fly peeked around the corner looks like they re gone ernie frowned are these aliens really that stupid he asked the captain afraid so captain memory replied ernie frowned something about this did nt seem to make sense if they re so stupid how come they ve got interstellar travel and blasters and stuff like that he asked pointedly well you know aliens have brotherinlaws too captain memory explained brothersinlaw sterno corrected uh right the captain went on uh relatives they have relatives too everybody has relatives so ernie wanted to know captain memory sighed well what do you do if your brother inlaw needs job but he not too um bright mean you cant leave him to starve right after all he married to your sister okay so maybe your sister does nt have real good taste in men she still your sister right and what about your nephews get to the point sterno demanded impatiently okay okay captain memory went on anyway you ve got to get him job but you do nt want to get him anything too like visible because you know he going to screw it up and you ll get blamed so you get him job that pays good but is um out of the way like for instance interstellar scout sure he ll screw it up but he millions of light years away who gon na know ernie looked crestfallen always thought they send you know their top guns their best and brightest to attack us you re mean they send their screwups to invade our planet captain memory shrugged well you know it bureaucracy this is the real universe life like that ernie sighed captain memory looked at his bare wrist anyway think its time to get going he headed off purposefully down the yellow brick road going in the opposite direction from that in which ricky and lucy had gone the group trailed along behind him chapter ernie caught up to captain memory as the foursome headed down the yellow brick road so where are we anyway he wanted to know the captain looked around could be kansas suppose he said thoughtfully you do nt know captain memory shrugged you ca nt expect me to keep track of all these places he said annoyedly do you know how many places there are in cyberspace there there he hesitated confusedly well do nt know exactly how many but there whole lot of them and they keep changing all the time too mean you can go someplace you know real well you come back in few nanoseconds and it all different it was bad enough before waldo stadium starting networking all these systems that were never meant to be networked now it impossible so do nt expect me to keep track of it it is nt my fault he calmed down anyway he said more composedly guess it could be nebraska ernie peered into the distance what all that smoke he pointed to large cloud on the horizon the fly looked searchingly into the distance with his huge multifaceted insect eyes he could see more clearly than any human that not smoke that dust he explained there whole lot of trucks and cars and stuff heading this way theres enough to be an army of em he peered into the distance in fact it is an army they got tanks and guns and everything ernie felt uneasy so whose army it is they fly squinted ca nt tell too much dust maybe we should just get out of the way and let them go by sterno suggested this seemed like an excellent idea to ernie they stepped off the road climbed over picturesque splitrail fence and made their way into cornfield where they hid themselves among the tall plants ernie noticed scarecrow out in the middle of the field he thought about it for moment but then he decided to just leave it alone in few minutes the first vehicles of the military column began to pass them ernie noticed that they were armored personnel carriers painted tan and grey on the side of each was the insignia of palm tree with swastika at the base ernie recognized it from watching war movies on the late show it the afrika korps he whispered to captain memory what would they be doing in kansas or maybe nebraska aha said captain memory quietly so that it rommel must be advancing on omaha therefore it will be up to prince eugene to stop the turkish hordes at the gates of vienna in that case colonel jackson must be heading down the mighty mississippi at this very moment taking little bacon and little beans to fight the bloody british at the town of new orleans that means captain memory looked at his wrist it must be 1814 oh ernie no longer expected captain memory explanations to shed much light on things although thinking about it something about the last part of captain memory explanation did sound little familiar but then on the other hand everything sounded little familiar but none of it actually made any sense ernie decided to try again even though he did nt have much hope of success so what going on anyway is nt this supposed to be like the wizard of oz or something do nt remember any nazi armies in the wizard of oz the wizard of oz the captain asked wonderingly whatever gave you that idea well gee ernie had thought it was obvious there this yellow brick road and the bank manager was kind of witch and she had ruby slippers and he trailed off so what the captain demanded well if this is nt the wizard of oz where did all that stuff come from the captain was annoyed sure some of this is from the wizard of oz but some of it is nt some of it from other games or computer models or databases or whatever happened to be in the systems that waldo been taking over and there no way to tell what ll pop out where or when even waldo ca nt keep track of it it taking all his computing power just to keep the system halfway organized so it does nt crash you know how hard it is to keep fatal error from creeping into this stuff it only because hes got multipleredundant neuralnet system that he can keep this stuff running at all ernie moaned he did nt like the sound of that fatal error business one thing bothers me though the captain continued watching the military vehicles go by these nazis they re showing up way too often they may be somehow picking up our trail you mean waldo stadium knows where we are ernie cried anxiously he zeroing in on us could be said the captain thoughtfully it does nt seem like they know exactly where we are but it does seem like they know we re around here somewhere wonder how they know that ernie sighed again he would have to remember not to ask for explanations anymore they just made things worse after few minutes the last of the military vehicles passed taking with it the last of the huge cloud of dust ernie coughed he and the others were all covered with thick layer of dirt he looked at himself all the sparkle was gone from his toreador suit sterno shook himself vigorously sending dust flying in all directions hey watch it the fly complained that stuff gets in my eyes you know ernie looked at captain memory how come you re not covered with dirt he demanded oh it the suit captain memory explained fingering his comicbookcharacter outfit it got that dirtrepelling stuff you know the kind you put in the dryer ernie examined his toreador outfit on the inside he found small tag just my luck ernie thought dry clean only they made their way back on to the road and continued in the same direction they had been heading before the convoy went by light breeze sprang up and carried away the worst of the dust after walking for few minutes ernie noticed house in the distance as they approached ernie could see that it was an elaborate victorian cottage covered with gingerbreadstyle ornamentation hey let stop in the fly suggested maybe we can get drink of water all this dust is really buggin me oh it bugging you asked sterno maliciously yeah the fly answered ingenuously sterno shrugged there was no point in sniping at people who were too dense to understand it as they neared the cottage ernie noticed that it was surrounded by white picket fence however large section of the fence had been knocked over the lawn seemed to be all chewed up as though by the treads of tank heading up the front walk ernie noticed the door was broken off it hinges as they climbed the porch ernie noticed that the gingerbread on the cottage was actual gingerbread the edible kind ernie broke off piece and sniffed it it seemed fresh he took bite very tasty he thought he suddenly realized that he had nt had anything to eat for really long time the shutters looked interesting they had frosting and raisins oh wow what happened here ernie heard the fly ask he looked through the door inside were obvious signs of struggle the quaint germanstyle furniture was scattered about the walls were pockmarked with bullet holes on one side of the room was large castiron stove next to the stove stood large cage with its door open the stove was redhot and bad smell came from it captain memory considered the scene and regarded the tank tracks and bullet holes looks like whoever was here got arrested by the nazis he commented ernie thought about this hansel and gretel arrested by the nazis but then again hansel and gretel is german story isnt it in that case ernie decided it none of my business wont worry about it instead he decided to look for something else to eat ernie found an oldfashioned icebox which seemed to be full of pies cakes and other goodies there did nt seem to be anything by way of regular wholesome food though oh well thought ernie cutting into bavarian black forest torte guess ll just have to rough it sterno was helping himself to an eclair very nice he commented would you mind handing me piece of that double chocolate rum cheesecake hey this is good stuff the fly added vacuuming up dish of frosted ginger snaps through his long snout ernie stopped hey how do we know this stuff is okay mean maybe this is an alien trap or something maybe this stuff is poisoned sterno sniffed disgustedly we can always count on you to say something utterly inappropriate at the table ca nt we comments like that can ruin everyone appetite the first decent thing we ve had to eat on this entire ridiculous escapade and you have to go and spoil it ernie was upset well okay maybe you re right that not dinnertable conversation but still how do we know sterno sighed the problem with you is that you have no sense of smell for one would have known if there was anything wrong with these delectable little morsels ernie relaxed so this place is nt an alien trap or anything he asked captain memory oh no it trap alright the captain said unconcernedly helping himself to dish of something with custard and cherries in it what but the food okay the captain continued so we might as well have some do nt you think he helped himself to coconut cream pie ernie suddenly felt very anxious so uh where the trap then oh do nt know the captain went on we ll find it though we always do he looked at ernie plate say are you gon na eat that black forest torte if you do nt want it ll take it ernie seemed to have lost his appetite uh here take it he handed the dish to captain memory ernie stomach was beginning to feel queasy again stress he thought it not good for me im gon na get an ulcer just know it ernie noticed an open door in the back of the cottage it seemed to lead to bathroom maybe can get cleaned up ernie thought the dust was beginning to make him itch inside the door ernie found nicelyappointed modern bathroom complete with soap and fresh towels ll bet have time for quick shower he thought he turned on the shower and let the water run for bit nice and warm he thought not too hot seems okay he took off his toreador suit shaking the dust off each piece in turn and got in the shower ernie let the warn water run over him well this is much better he thought relaxing there was bottle of shampoo on the tub shelf he picked it up and examined it placental protein shampoo oh that was the same kind of shampoo he used at home maybe it would get the dust out of his hair watch ouph phrm trmp what was somebody talking to him ernie could nt hear over the sound of the shower he stuck his head out did you say something he called towards the others yes answered captain memory said watch out for the trap what ernie leaped out of the shower he was about to run into the next room when suddenly it occurred to him that he was stark naked and dripping wet he decided to take moment to grab towel and wrap it around himself he was nt prepared to face the ridicule he would have gotten otherwise what trap where the trap you re holding it captain memory gestured at ernie the towel ernie almost flung it away but decided against it no your other hand ernie looked at his left hand he was still unconsciously clutching the bottle of shampoo this this bottle of shampoo ernie examined it what is it bomb or something no it bottle of shampoo captain memory agreed so what the big deal ernie felt little foolish getting all upset over bottle of shampoo what kind of shampoo is it captain memory prompted placental protein shampoo what wrong with that do you know what placenta is yeah it the thing that feeds an embryo in the womb ernie had gotten an in biology and was proud of it ever wonder what proteins from embryos are doing in your shampoo uh now that you mention it that does seem little strange ernie admitted ever wonder proteins from embryos of what the captain prodded or what kind of proteins do nt like the sound of this ernie said quietly captain memory went on dna is protein you know ernie thought moment you mean dna like in genetic material like basic building blocks of life the stuff that determines what every kind of life form is going to be that right the captain agreed now what do you suppose would happen to you if you rubbed alien dna from unborn space creatures onto your scalp where it could seep right down into your brain ernie looked at the bottle of shampoo uneasily you mean it could like take over your brain could be captain memory agreed however it does nt work all at once it has to seep in little by little the more you wash your hair the worse it gets ernie was suddenly glad he did nt wash his hair too often he thought for moment so people who wash their hair lot would get it the worst right you got it captain memory assented cheerfully ernie considered the problem so who washes their hair the most pretty girls the fly chimed in they wash their hair every day sometimes more than once know cause every time ask one out one she says ca nt go today got ta wash my hair that true ernie admitted he thought moment wait minute we have this stuff at home in fact my girlfriend uses it the captain considered this noticed any changes in her recently well she has been kind of cold ernie conceded and now that you mention it have noticed her skin getting kind of scaly but thought it was just the heartbreak of psoriasis tried to say something about it but she hissed at me mmm hmm captain memory agreed yknow noticed that lot too the fly added real observant and noticed that an awful lot of pretty girls nowadays have forked tongues ernie frowned he had noticed something odd about his girlfriend tongue but he had nt wanted to mention it he didnt want to get hissed at again they also have real sharp teeth the fly continued and slit pupils in their eyes do nt think that normal do you all of this was making ernie very unhappy you mean aliens are trying to take over the earth he asked would nt doubt it captain memory answered cheerfully well what are we going to do about it cried ernie oh you do nt need to worry about it said the captain reassuringly why not asked ernie suspiciously it just game anyway right the captain gave ernie cheery smile and helped himself to piece of lemon meringue pie there is one thing you could do sterno added what asked ernie desperately you could put some clothes on sterno said looking ruefully at the peach frappe on his plate the sight of all that naked skin is rather spoiling my appetite oh all right ernie snapped stomping off to the bathroom sterno sighed some people are so sensitive he commented reaching for large cherries jubilee ernie was somewhat placated to find that the luster had returned to his toreador suit the only thing worse than having to go around in toreador outfit was having to go around in dirty toreador outfit he returned to the main room the fly was eating what seemed to be large cookies of some kind hey these are good gingerbread men he remarked offering one to ernie ernie examined the cookie it not man he said thoughtfully it looks like gingerbread reptile the fly looked at the cookies yeah you re right he vacuumed another one up through his snout they re good though ernie looked at the cookie ruefully do nt know if want to eat reptile might as well captain memory volunteered it wouldnt hesitate to eat you ernie put the cookie down quickly he seemed to have lost his appetite again ernie heard footsteps approaching the house man in post office uniform carrying bag of mail was coming up the walk howdy the mailman said cheerfully nice day is nt it uh yeah ernie thought he should be the one to answer since everyone else had their mouths full the mailman chatted on cheerily had few nazis mite earlier but it looks like it cleared up he looked through his mail is there mr ernest ross here uh that me ernie answered unenthusiastically here you go the mailman handed ernie letter have nice day he left ernie opened the letter and read dear mr ross we are

looked between the pages there was no enclosed envelope he read on sincerely first national bank of the west ps if you are experiencing financial difficulties at the moment please contact one of our representatives to work out payment plan as little as trillion dollars month could satisfactorily take care of this account thank you ernie sighed is nt there anywhere you can go to get away from junk mail doubt it answered captain memory cutting himself big slice of pineapple upsidedown cake ernie sighed and sat down on the nearest piece of furniture which happened to be child rocking chair which was bit too small for him ernie noticed while squeezing himself into it that the arms were scraping some of the sequins off his suit looking down he noticed that sequins had been falling off his suit all along leaving sparkly trail as he walked oh great he thought now on top of everything else my suit is shedding captain memory looked at his bare wrist guess it must be just about time for the eggplant uprising he commented the what ernie was confused as usual oh come on the captain was annoyed do nt you pay attention to anything tell you you know the revolt of the vegetables the purple menace remember when they nuked us back to the stone age oh sure ernie remembered being nuked well enough he had some vague recollection of the other stuff too he decided to pretend he remembered the rest of it as well since he was tired of being picked on for not paying attention so uh what about it well anyway the captain went on after the great traffic jam the what ernie broke in involuntarily oh you re right said the captain slightly abashed did nt tell you about that the great traffic jam took place because of this problem they had due to chronic overproduction of cars you see they just kept building all these cars and people kept buying them just for the heck of it even though they didnt have anyplace to go in them well of course it had to happen one particularly nice summer day everybody decided to go for drive all at the same time they wound up bumpertobumper coastto coast the entire country was tied up in total gridlock people did nt know what to do they did nt know how to get around without their cars anymore it was terrible there was mass starvation thousands died vultures picked their bones through their convertible tops well sure you can see that under circumstances like these people were in no mood for practical joke uh right ernie thought he just agree and maybe the captain would go on with the story without noticing that ernie was nt following the story at all ernie was lucky the captain continued well you can imagine how people felt when rumors began to fly about certain species of giant plants that had escaped from the atomic testing laboratories and had grown to enormous size by feasting on human flesh and how these plants were determined to get revenge on the entire animal kingdom for the millions of years of abuse they and their plant brothers had had to put up with at the hands and paws and muzzles and so on of nonvegetable life forms ernie furled his brow does that have anything to do with the vegetable rights movement you got it agreed captain memory ernie felt sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach in spite of himself he was beginning to remember all this he didnt want to remember it because if he remembered it that meant ernie did nt want to think about what that meant anyway the captain continued they were going to organize all the vegetables stage massive uprising and eliminate all animal life for ever on top of all this these plants were invulnerable to conventional weapons and could only be destroyed by the atomic fires that had created them small wonder then that general panic broke out when something very large and very purple raised it leafy head over the city of chicago captain memory chuckled oh wow said ernie this was really creepy it was lot like telling ghost stories around the campfire at camp so it was giant maneating eggplant do nt be silly how could there be such thing as giant maneating eggplant captain memory was amused no it was just practical joke it was that zany andreas labyrinth and his band of merry pranksters up to their little games again captain memory chortled still remember that phony russian invasion that was really riot or how about that bogus epidemic that had everybody in stitches something about that explanation did nt seem quite right to ernie but he was nt in the mood to try to figure out what it was he wanted to hear the rest of captain memory story so then what happened uh will happen uh so what about the eggplant well as was saying captain memory always enjoyed telling stories it was nt really giant eggplant it was really just big purple balloon but it looked lot like giant eggplant you know big scary face painted on it and all suppose in saner times people might have questioned the whole thing little more closely after all there was nt really any proof that it was giant eggplant it could have been giant grape no reason to nuke giant grape is there guess not ernie supposed he might as well agree since he could nt think of any reason on earth to nuke giant grape but people just did nt stop and think the captain went on they just went ahead and dropped the bomb and when they found out boy were they mad captain memory chuckled of course it is nt really funny if it does nt make somebody mad is it thats what practical jokes are all about captain memory paused but anyway all of this should be taking place just about he looked at his bare wrist now sound like that of distant thunder shook the house ernie looked out the window chicago he asked yup answered the captain there it goes ernie thought moment did they nuke chicago twice why would they want to do something like that captain memory wondered once you nuke it it stays nuked well in that case ernie pondered how could we be in chicago just before it got nuked before when we re here just before it got nuked now captain memory frowned that is confusing is nt it ive never quite figured that out the captain did nt seem overly upset about the problem ernie decided that it probably would nt be good for him to think about that problem anymore he decided to think about something else so what ever happened to that practical joker that andreas whatshisname he asked as if in answer to this question figure burst through the door it was an older man with wild white beard and hair his clothes were in tatters and he was covered with splotches of egg rotten tomatoes and other things too disgusting to think about hide me hide me he implored they re after me they ll tear me to pieces it was just joke did nt know they take it seriously it was just practical joke well ernie began suddenly the man seemed to see ernie clearly for the first time bullfighter he looked at captain memory comicbook character he looked at the fly giant fly what is your problem sterno demanded talking dog the man shrieked you re all worse than me ve got to get out of here they ll tear you all to pieces with that the man threw himself through the nearest window which luckily had been glazed with large panes of sugar instead of glass he sprinted towards group of trees behind the house and disappeared into large hole beneath one of them ernie thought he saw large white rabbit with watch disappear into the hole as well but he was nt sure captain memory looked at his bare wrist really like to get watch he commented it does nt have to be anything fancy timex would be okay the fly was looking out the door uh oh he said ominously here they come here who comes ernie demanded anxiously the angry villagers the fly said unhappily you know with the torches and the rocks and everything you do nt want to mess with the angry villagers man they re mean they fly shuddered he seemed to have had some kind of bad experience with them in the past uh maybe we ought to get out of here ernie suggested have nt finished my strawberry mousse sterno said petulantly oh man do nt know what we re gon na do said the fly miserably they re closing in on us from all sides ernie peered through the broken window he could see the smoke from their torches in the distance it occurred to him that perhaps they should barricade the door or something unfortunately the door had already been broken off its hinges by the nazis ernie put it upright in the doorframe as best he could and shoved small rocking chair up against it to hold it do nt think that gon na stop anybody the fly said glumly ernie could hear angry shouts the villagers were approaching fast think we better do something ernie urged captain memory oh yeah captain memory looked up unconcernedly like what with crash rock came sailing through on of the unbroken windows the angry shouts were quite close now ernie couldnt understand them though they seemed to be in german burning torch came sailing through an open window another landed just outside the door thick black smoke began to fill the air ew burning sugar complained sterno how rank the fly peeked out window oh man those angry villagers they re bad news hey this place is burning up ernie urged captain memory we ve got to do something captain memory made wry face well guess there no point in hanging around here anymore he thought moment lets try 011f 0d 0001 the scene vanished blinking ernie found himself once again in an entirely different place he staggered and his stomach flipflopped oh man he moaned do nt know if can take these sudden changes of scene anymore oh captain memory seemed surprised would you rather be back at the gingerbread cottage ernie straightened up abruptly no no that okay fine just fine just as soon be right um he looked around captain memory the fly and sterno were all looking around as well they were in what appeared to be large government office it was big room with high arched ceiling lit by rows of fluorescent lights the walls were painted eyesaver green it looks like an oldfashioned post office or something ernie thought in the middle of the room was long row of tables with forms in little pigeonholes and pens attached by chains row of windows occupied one wall each with boredlooking clerk doing something with papers sign above the windows said federal bureau of drawers ernie was puzzled why did you bring us here he asked captain memory this is nt quite what expected admitted the captain he seemed just as puzzled as ernie actually did nt really want to leave really wanted to have another piece of cake german chocolate as matter of fact he sighed guess wo nt get my cake now ernie sighed as well he wished he had taken advantage of the opportunity to eat something while they were still at the cottage he was beginning to get really hungry and it did nt look like he was going to be able to find anything to eat here ernie looked around what is this place the captain regarded the building thoughfully not sure but think it database database ernie was confused thought data in cyberspace was supposed to look like big glowing geometric forms that you could fly around in yeah well you could do that if you wanted the captain explained but businesses usually do nt they secretaries dont like em they like something little more you know traditional like this he gestured at the building around them their discussion was interrupted by shrill nasal voice next please ernie looked around confusedly that you an unpleasantlooking older woman with her hair pulled back in tight bun seemed to be pointing at him step up to the window please ernie looked at captain memory what should we do the captain shrugged guess we should step up to the window they did so hello captain memory said pleasantly to the woman behind the window can you tell us why we re here certainly she said through tight lips captain memory smiled see he said to ernie this isnt going to be hard at all the woman behind the window smirked unpleasantly just fill out this form she handed thick sheaf of papers to captain memory the captain face fell what this for the woman smirked happily that form 4729 request for information assume you have your authorized form 7391 with you uh do nt think so the captain answered confusedly what is it oh you must have your form 7391 request for request for information completely filled out authorized and validated before we can process your form 4729 request for information oh you do nt have form 7391 here you are the woman handed captain memory another thick sheaf of papers captain memory looked very unhappy he leafed though the forms these are real long he complained be sure to read all the directions the woman simpered cheerfully her mood seemed to be improving with every passing form and fill in all the blanks except those marked do not fill in this blank of course if you fail to fill in any of the correct blanks or if you should happen to fill in any blank marked do not fill in this blank then you ll have to start all over again she cackled with glee at the thought and of course you ll need form 6729 request for authorization of forms form 3451 request for validation of forms form 4472b request for instructions for authorization and validation of forms and form 2392a application for verification of authorization and validation she handed captain memory four more thick forms he now had pile of forms about eight inches high in front of him and of course she said to ernie we ll need complete set of forms from you as well she handed ernie similar stack of papers and from you and from you she handed the fly and sterno each their own stack the woman seemed positively ecstatic now ernie looked at the pile in shock there theres thousands of them oh yes said the woman gleefully there used to be only hundreds but ever since they passed the paperwork reduction act we ve had far more ernie regarded the papers with dismay after you ve filled all those out the woman continued delightedly we ll start on the rest the foursome took their piles of forms to the tables in the middle of the room and began leafing through them despondently these government offices are always so depressing sterno complained why must they always paint them that ghastly shade of green ernie decided that he agreed with sterno but he was too depressed to talk he began leafing listlessly through his form 2392 application for verification of authorization and validation for no other reason than that it happened to be at the top of the pile it started out straightforwardly enough name social security father name mother name mother maiden name do not write in this space grandfather name grandmother name ernie tried to fill in his name but the pen on the little chain would nt write instead he flipped few pages ahead great grandmother on your father mother side maiden name great grandmother on your father mother side dependent children living with her at the time of marriage if any names do not write in this space stop did you write in this space if so take the letters of your name add their numerical equivalents to your date of birth and turn to the appropriate section as indicated by the table on page 349 follow directions carefully then discard this form and start all over ernie sighed he leafed ahead few more pages enter one of the following your adjusted gross income minus unrecovered depreciation otherwise deductible on form 692a but including accrued losses not otherwise reported on this form the sum total of all the money you ever made in your entire life the sum total of the sum total of all the money you ever made in your entire life and all the money your father andor mother made in their entire lives or how much you got complete the above and roll again if doubles forfeit one turn otherwise proceed to the nearest rr and pay owner twice what he would otherwise receive do not pass go do not collect 200 do not write in this space ernie looked up do you get the feeling they re playing games with us he asked the others oh no cried the fly desperately what said ernie alarmed wrote in the space that says do not write in this space wailed the fly tsk tsk said sterno you re in big trouble now ernie was glad that it was someone other than himself who was in big trouble for change he looked over at captain memory the captain was having hard time filling out his forms he seemed to have gotten stuck ernie looked over his shoulder as matter of fact the captain seemed to have gotten stuck on the first space name should put captain memory or memory captain he mused ernie noticed that the captain form was different from his ernie read name rank serial number in twentyfive 25 words or less explain how you manage to travel through cyberspace without stopping at the approprite checkpoints andor checksums be concise use specific examples and remember neatness counts if you need more room use separate sheet do not write in this space know said captain memory can put memory under name and captain under rank wonder what should put under cereal number ernie suddenly became very uneasy think maybe we should just get out of here while we have the chance sterno was leafing through his pile of papers aha he cried here we go form 1193 request for authorization to apply for license to purchase cigars now we re getting somewhere sterno did not find the forms upsetting at all in fact he seemed to be the only one able to deal with them he began scribbling industriously in the blanks as ernie watched he took his sheaf of forms to one of the windows where it was stamped he then took it to another window where large gold seal was affixed to it then on to another window where several people signed it he then disappeared around corner and returned moments later carrying large box of cigars wow the fly was awestruck that amazing wonder how he does that it not really that difficult commented sterno lighting up big cigar his disposition always improved tremendously when he had cigar ll tell you secret the universe is actually giant bureaucracy it possible to get anything in the cosmos done if you fill out the right forms however filling out the right forms can sometimes be very difficult indeed he puffed his cigar appreciatively havanas no less one needs special permit to get these ll have you know the fly meanwhile was intent on trying to erase what he had written in the space marked do not write in this space so far he had only succeeded in tearing hole in the paper ernie meanwhile was noticing the fact that all the clerks and tellers seemed to be watching them another unusual thing struck him hey guys he commented did you notice that theres all these clerks and all these officials but no customers besides us egad that is odd agreed sterno everyone knows that the usual ratio is 116312 customers per clerk he looked around where are all the lines ve never seen government office this empty except of course at the administration for not doing anything at all building and even there only after 500 pm on weekends it does seem suspicious ernie was thrilled that for once someone agreed with him okay well that proves it right so let get out of here okay ve got it cried captain memory he grabbed pen and wrote in large childlike block letters in the space marked serial number frosted flakes there he said beaming he looked at the next line and his face fell oh it an essay question hate essay questions so let get out of here okay ernie urged he felt more uneasy with each passing moment captain memory sighed guess we might as well never gon na finish this thing he pushed the pile of papers aside ernie began slowly heading toward the door acutely aware of all the clerks watching him he tried to act as nonchalant as possible whistling little tune and shuffling his feet as he walked just minute he heard the old woman clerk cry out just where do you think you re going uh uh ernie stammered do nt you know you re not allowed to leave without filling out form 9150 application for authorization to apply for permission for an interruption in completion of forms she shrieked get back here ernie thought fast uh got ta go to the bathroom the old woman glared at the other three and what about you the others followed ernie lead uh we all got ta go to the bathroom they chorused in unison the clerk scowled all right fill out this form 7711 request for permission to apply for authorization for admission to the sanitary facility she snapped anyway you re going the wrong way the bathroom that way she pointed down long corridor which seemed to disappear into the bowels of the building ernie looked at the others run he yelled they all sprinted for the door stop them shrieked the old woman but they were already through the door outside they found themselves on the dingy streets of what appeared to be large city greatly in need of urban renewal wed better keep moving ernie urged they re right behind us the fly looked back no they re not ernie stopped confused and turned around sure enough there was no sign of pursuit why are nt they chasing us ernie wondered oh here the reason said captain memory regarding his bare wrist it five oclock civil servants never work past five he continued to regard his bare wrist really like to get watch ernie breathed sigh of relief so we re safe then at least till nine oclock tomorrow morning captain memory agreed he looked around brightly let go for walk maybe we can find jewelry store somewhere around here captain memory paused reflectively looking at his bare wrist it does nt have to be rolex seiko would be okay of course would nt mind rolex they began strolling down the street as they neared the corner they began to hear music in the distance ernie recognized the sound of steel drums and guitars reggae he said somebody playing reggae music around here ernie relaxed while he was nt particular fan of reggae music it made him fell more at home to come across anything at all he could recognize as they turned the corner they came upon group of black people who seemed to be having party they wore brightcolored clothes and had their hair hanging down in long braids dreadlocks ernie recognized they must be rastafarians the fly seemed totally confused by these people hey guy he said to one of them uh do you live around here oh no mon the man answered in thick jamaican accent we not from here mon we from de islands we rastas in spite of himself ernie found himself becoming suspicious for one thing they did nt look like other black people ernie knew there was something funny about their skin tone it was unusually black and it seemed to be coming off on objects around them out of corner of his eye ernie noticed trash can nearby it seemed to be full of empty bottles of black shoe polish another of the rastafarians approached the fly hey brother he said pointing at the fly antenna you got de dreadlocks too see here smoke some of dis ganja he handed the fly funnylooking cigarette uh thanks the fly accepted the cigarette however he could nt seem to fit it into his snout no matter which way he held it ernie heard the reassuring strains of bob marley and the wailers drifting out through nearby doorway but he was unable to shake his suspicions he noticed something unusual about the mans footwear since when do rastas wear jackboots the man seemed momentarily nonplussed but quickly recovered his composure oh sure mon we all wear de jackboots now it de new in thing he turned to the fly ai nt dat right brother the fly had managed to get grip on the cigarette with his snout and was puffing away he started to giggle jackboots sure why not dere you go mon the rasta said reassuringly while taking out monocle and fitting it into his eye you got nothin to worry about we just rastas mon we not nazis or nothin he laughed oh no the fly was giggling uncontrollably now hey that great music he said enthusiastically you guys are really alright this is fun he broke down into fits of hysterical giggling take it easy mon the rasta said to ernie my name jack from monterey dey call me monterey jack sterno stiffened monterey jack do you know what that is he hissed it it cheese the rasta stood abruptly up the monocle dropping out of his eye seize them he shrieked his islands accent abruptly vanishing run shouted ernie and sterno together hey guys what the rush asked the fly his head lolling from side to side is nt this fun party come on ernie grabbed the fly tie and pulled him along like puppy on leash the ran down the narrow street the fly stumbling and giggling close behind them were the imitation rastas discarding their caribbean clothes as they ran to reveal nazi uniforms beneath quick in here ernie pulled the fly into an open doorway followed by sterno and captain memory inside was flight of stairs they ran up the stairs and through door at the first landing to find themselves in long corridor lined by rows of doors looks like an apartment building or maybe hotel ernie observed maybe we can find room to hide in good idea sterno agreed like room with tv if you do nt mind captain memory added ernie glared at him and hurried down the hall still dragging the fly by the necktie an open door beckoned the four rushed into what appeared to be an ordinary somewhat rundown hotel room slammed the door behind them and locked it whew ernie breathed sigh of relief well do nt think they can find us in here look like we re safe the fly collapsed into an overstuffed chair he held his hands up in front of his face oh wow he said wonderingly did you ever look at your hands mean really look at them he started giggling again hmmph sterno sniffed some people just ca nt hold their ganja there was knock on the door ssh ernie cautioned the others let just be quiet and they wo nt know we re in here ve know you re in dere voice outside the door shouted ernie was astonished how could they know we were in here he whispered to the others dat easy answered the voice from behind them door ve just follow ze trail of sequins ernie looked at his toreador suit large sparkleless patches confirmed his worst fears sure enough faint but clearly identifiable trail of sequins led under the door ernie became aware of everyone glaring at him except of course the fly who was still busily examining his hands you again snarled sterno well hey ernie shrugged defensively what am supposed to do you know the knock sounded again this time louder open up ernie looked at the door ll be cool about this he decided maybe can fake them out uh yes he called out brightly who there nazis came the reply open up uh no thanks we do nt want any you vill open zis door now ernie thought fast uh in the bathroom right now could you come back later break down ze door something large and heavy thudded into the door ernie looked around the room frantically the fire escape ernie pointed through an open window quick everybody out that way the ran to the window and climbed down the fire escape ernie pulling the fly by the necktie hey what the rush guys asked the fly giggling we just got here as they hurried down the fire escape ernie heard the sound of the door breaking down behind them after zem voice cried the bottom of the fire escape led to narrow alley hurrying along it the found themselves facing large iron door there was no other way out of the alley the sounds of pursuit were close behind them ernie tried the doorknob it was unlocked quick through here he shouted they four scrambled through the door and slammed it behind them inside it was totally dark ernie felt along the doorframe for lock he found one and locked it he found another and locked that too there was also large bolt and huge padlock he locked those as well there he said that should keep them out we re safe now he breathed sigh of relief where are we he heard captain memory voice ask cant see thing ernie inched carefully forward his hands outstretched hoping to find lamp or light switch or something suddenly from out of the darkness voice rang out ah how nice of you to return the voice said ve haff been vaiting for you uh oh ernie began think we re in trouble guys the nowfamiliar voice of the gameshow announcer boomed out you sure are because it time for wheel of torture there was the sound of tremendous applause the entire scene erupted into blinding light the announcer continued and now for our first contestant from toledo ohio it goombah the toreador my name ernie ernie complained gim me break huh sure the announcer agreed cheerfully what would you like broken ernie heard uproarious laughter say the announcer continued just love your suit youre missing few sequins though ernie heard laughter again this time cut short in very artificialsounding way his eyes were beginning to adjust to the light but he still could nt see clearly and here our second contestant from des moines iowa its seth brundage the human fly aw wish you would nt call me that the fly complained it makes real bad impression you know could nt you just call me seth sure thing mr fly the announcer agreed jovially the fly moaned and not from des moines either ernie vision was beginning to clear up they were unfortunately back on the stage of wheel of torture they seemed to have blundered or been maneuvered into the same stage they had escaped from twice before ernie just hoped they would be able to escape from it again he looked out towards the audience there was no audience just empty chairs ernie looked around there were no guards no chorus girls in fact there was only one person the gestapos greatest sturmbannfuhrer dr heinz von liederkranz the man whose name sounds like cheese ernie heard thunderous applause tank you tank you von liederkranz bowed in the direction of the nonexistent audience he then reached out and shut off small tape recorder the applause ended abruptly he turned on another small tape recorder and now on with the show the recorded voice of the announcer rang out von liederkranz shut that one off too zo ve meet again von liederkranz smiled unpleasantly now you are in my power you vill tell me vhat vant to know ernie looked at the empty chairs what happened to the audience von liederkranz face turned hard dat vas most unfortunate dey all refused to confess und vas forced to eliminate dem for vhich he looked around quickly finding no one else around him he settled on ernie you vill pay schweinhund he cried slapping ernie with his riding crop why me cried ernie did nt silence von liederkranz eyed them all suspiciously unfortunately vill not be able to interrogate you at de moment due to um temporary staff shortage until zis situation can be remedied vill be forced to keep you locked up zis time however you vill not escape due to ze incompetence of guards ze guards have been liquidated he smiled evilly now you vill go behind door nummer one marsch he gestured at them with an evillooking weapon the foursome found themselves herded through door number one which crashed shut behind them with very loud and ominous clang ernie looked around his eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the darkness they seemed to be back in the same large dungeon cell they had been held in before the room was dimly lit by torch attached to one wall the far reaches of the room disappeared into the darkness making it impossible to tell exactly how big the cell was oh man the fly complained not here again this place is no fun waited for my date in here for days man she never showed up could nt even get drink while waited the service in here is terrible he peered into the darkness waiter waiter he sighed it does nt do any good nobody ever comes ernie peered into the darkness no he could nt see anything that even remotely resembled waiter however straining his ears he did seem to hear something it sounded like sniffling and perhaps crying who there he called into the darkness two small figures began to approach into the light as they approached ernie could see that they were children little boy and little girl they were both dressed in german national costumes the girl was wearing dirndl and the boy was wearing lederhosen and little alpine hat they both seemed very sad ernie was surprised hi there he said to the little boy in kindly manner what your name my name is hansel said the boy with heavy german accent und dis is my sister gretel the fly regarded the children say you kids have nt seen my date have you she about fivefoottwo eyes of blue the children looked at him uncomprehendingly the fly sighed oh well it was worth try ernie regarded the children with amazement how did you kids get

how vas ve to know she vas gestapo agent gee that tough kid ernie said sympathetically he hoped hansel would nt cry he never knew what to do around crying children well cheer up kid captain memory added in brightly it could be worse how asked hansel innocently uh captain memory thought for moment ll get back to you on that he fell silent hansel whimpered it so cold and dark and awful in here afraid ernie winced oh he gon na start crying he thought what am gon na do do nt know what to do when kids cry ernie tried to think of something to do uh cheer up kid maybe ll tell you story hansel brightened oh do you know good story ernie frowned uh well no he turned to captain memory hey tell these kids story you know lots of stories tell us story tell us story the children jumped up and down in front of captain memory the captain seemed confused well uh dunno oh man said the fly you re not gon na disappoint these poor little kids are you tell em something captain memory hesitated well gee

did these kids know about that gretel too was jumping up and down excitedly tell us how you can jump from places dat are not supposed to accept any external commands tell us dat one the captain seemed unsure well do nt know if should talk about that oh sure said hansel reassuringly you can tell us all about it dere no harm in it ve re just little kids you can tell us everything you know really should nt the captain began oh come on hansel cajoled why not we re just little kids who want to hear story we re not midgets just little kids and he laughed we re certainly not gestapo agents gretel laughed too oh no we re not midget gestapo agents nothing of the kind how silly to even think such thing hansel gestured at gretel see dot proves it und vere certainly not trying to pump you for information ve just vant you to tell us story ja captain memory breathed sigh of relief well that load off my mind gut gut hansel and gretel beamed now you vill tell us vhat ve vant to know ja sure said captain memory brightly uh he scratched his head what were we talking about again hansel fumed talk schweinhund or else ve he noticed gretel glaring at him he caught himself oh ja he laughed feebly you vill tell us how you jump from place to place ja sterno looked at the children suspiciously there something very peculiar about these children he remarked he looked them up and down carefully you children he demanded what is your last name hansel and gretel looked at each other in confusion our what you last name sterno insisted your first names are hansel and gretel what are your last names even germans have last names hansel and gretel put their heads together and began whispering furiously between them last names dey did nt give us vhat do ve say finally the looked up uh colby dot our last name hansel and gretel colby ein gut name ja sterno stiffened do you know what that is he hissed it it cheese colby cheese look of fury passed over both hansel and gretel faces dummkopf gretel screamed at hansel you give away ze whole show und ve vas zo close me hansel shrieked back it vas you you pick zis stupid name suddenly the door to the dungeon cell flew open von liederkranz stood in the doorway framed in light zo he said menacingly my liddle subterfuge does not fool you eh dot is most unfortunate now vill have to interrogate you meinself out the entire group stepped out of the dungeon cell and back onto the stage of wheel of torture von liederkranz turned to hansel and gretel und as for you they winced such incompetence is not to be tolerated you vill perhaps step behind door nummer four ja the midgets blanched nein nein not door nummer four marsch von liederkranz gestured toward the door with his evillooking weapon the midgets filed sadly through the door which slammed shut behind them ernie heard two piercing blood curdling screams and then silence shaken he turned to captain memory what what is behind door number four the captain shook his head sadly you do nt want to know ernie thought for moment and decided that probably the captain was right von liederkranz smiled evilly und now ze interrogation too bad you did not tell ze midgets ze story dey vanted to hear it vould have been much easier for you he stopped sniffing at something in the air vot is dat smell he inquired of noone in particular his eyes lighted on sterno whose cigar smoke was drifting his way vot are you smoking oh care for one sterno offered politely theyre havanas very nice von liederkranz accepted one his eyes narrowed vhere did you get dese it takes special permit to buy dese of course sterno agreed you need form 1193 request for authorization to apply for license to purchase cigars and you have to have it validated verified stamped sealed notarized and signed in triplicate of course then you file it wait for your authorization number and then see von liederkranz interrupted of course he did nt see at all but listening to this sort of thing gave him headache you must be very important to have such privileges sterno puffed himself up proudly well as matter of fact they were interrupted by knock at the door who dares to interrupt me von liederkranz fumed mailman cheerful voice answered vot do you vant von liederkranz answered angrily the same cheerfullooking mailman entered how did he get through all those locks ernie wondered got letter here

hey guys we got ta think of some other phrase to use around here do nt think it safe to say gim me he looked uneasily at von liederkranz who was smirking menacingly uh to say that thing we just said you know ernie opened his letter and read even though he had sinking feeling that he knew what it was going to say he was right dear mr ross we have been retained by the national bank of the west to

commiseratingly too have problems vith money in fact begin to see now vhere some of my problems come from he pulled out wickedlooking weapon and held it in ernies face vhat have you done vith my prize

evilly ze pain generator has intensity settings dat vas number ze numbers go up to 100 you vould like to try perhaps 25 ernie blanched all he could think of to say was well there was knock on the door mailman aha von liederkranz cried excitedly knew it ze prize notification von liederkranz ran to the door and threw it open frantically the door flew open and von liederkranz froze in horror mein gott he shrieked there an inch outside the door was huge post office dump truck it bed lifted its tailgate open ready to dump von liederkranz had time for only one short scream before he was completely engulfed in huge flood of slick paper magazines captain memory shook his head sadly poor guy he should have read the fine print it clearly says that ordering all the magazines wo nt increase your chances to win tough ernie said callously after his brush with the pain generator he was nt in the mood to be too sympathetic about anything that happened to von liederkranz so why do nt we get out of here okay hmm said captain memory thoughtfully out of here you say well that all well and good mean anybody can just say let get out of here but he trailed off do you have problem with that ernie wanted to know well um said captain memory thoughtfully not exacly sure where we should go next my last location did nt work out quite the way intended it hoow about the dead sea phonograph records ernie suggested maybe we should go and check them out will you get off that dead sea phonograph records business sterno snapped that the most ridiculous thing ive heard in in he thought moment two billion years well have you got better idea ernie said exasperatedly loot rape and pillage said the fly thoughtfully what ernie did nt know what to make of that statement at all you know the fly continued what the nazi was saying loot rape and pillage it reminds me of something but cant quite recall what the fly concentrated does nt it just drive you crazy when you can almost think of something and then just when you think you got it it gets away from you know what you mean said ernie sympathetically let me see now said captain memory reflectively he seemed to be taking the fly problem very seriously that was rape loot and pillage sterno frowned do nt think that right captain memory looked surprised what wrong with it its not song title is it no sterno thought moment it could be heavymetal rock song but do nt think it is captain memory breathed sigh of relief well that one less thing to worry about he fell silent he seemed to be lost in thought sterno continued think it supposed to be loot pillage and rape the fly considered this loot pillage rape not loot rape pillage how about pillage rape loot ernie chimed in the others glared at him do nt be ridiculous sterno snapped attila the hun the fly cried excitedly what ernie said exasperatedly what in the world does that have to do with anything that what was trying to think of the fly was jubilant boy do feel better he turned to captain memory hey it was attila the hun the captain seemed to have sunk into reverie the flys comment seemed to suddenly startle him out of it what oh attila the hun well guess ca nt think of anything better ernie did nt like the sound of this wait minute what but it was too late 0028 ce 21 captain memory cried the scene vanished chapter the foursome found themselves standing on grassy hill in this distance column of smoke rose heavenward from village that was being pillaged possibly looted and raped as well it was too far to see there you go guys said captain memory cheerfully attila the hun now what what do you mean now what ernie demanded if you dont know what we re going to do here then why did you bring us here thought you wanted to come here captain memory protested it was nt my idea was just trying to be nice actually thought it was kind of weird thing to do mean we could have gone to vegas we could have gone to hawaii but no you want to go see attila the hun well whose idea was it then ernie wanted to know well it certainly was nt my idea sterno demurred they all looked at the fly he shifted uncomfortably hey was just making conversation you know did nt mean we should actually come and see attila the hun do nt even know the guy you know captain memory chuckled how about that we came all the way to ancient rome and nobody really wanted to go at all funny how things work out is nt it well guess we ll just have to make the best of it ernie looked out across the fields how can we be in anciant rome anyway he asked educational software the captain explained the history of the world database all the schools have it oh ernie looked down he noticed they were standing on road he would have assumed it was one of the famous roman roads except that it was made of yellow brick ernie was almost certain that the romans did nt build their roads out of yellow bricks but he decided not to say anything about it just in case he was wrong he was sick of being made fun of wonder where this road leads ernie speculated rome sterno answered with certainty how do you know ernie was skeptical everybody knows that sterno answered with authority all roads lead to rome hey that ll be fun the fly chimed in maybe we can get togas maybe we can have toga party he started chanting toga toga toga yeah maybe we can get shot full of arrows by the huns too ernie added glumly they began walking down the yellow brick road in the distance pall of smoke rose from nearby pillaged villages hey theres building up ahead the fly observed they walked nearer oh it roman villa they re supposed to be very luxurious let take look at it ernie was doubtful what if it been pillaged do nt be ridiculous sterno snapped it villa not village you ca nt very well pillage villa it does nt even rhyme oh sorry ernie felt like he just could nt stop making mistakes they education they give young people these days sterno sniffed it just disgrace whatever happened to the classical education where come from everyone who is anyone has classical education do nt have classical education the fly commented my point exactly sterno smirked the fly frowned hey are you putting me down or something oh perish forbid said sterno sneeringly far be it from me to put you down when you do such wonderful job of it yourself oh uh thanks the fly seemed confused he brightened say do you suppose there ll be any beautiful harem girls in that villa sterno looked disgusted this is rome they do nt have harems in rome only the arabs have harems aww the fly seemed deeply disappointed thought occurred to ernie hey this is ancient rome you just noticed that sterno said sarcastically ll bet this has something to do with the dead sea phonograph records sterno sighed disgustedly will you please get off that dead sea phonograph records business you are the only person know who organizes their entire life around articles in sensational tabloids why ca nt you worry about something serious like alien elvis clones serious look came over ernie face do you suppose should sterno sighed again hopeless they approached the villa large white marble porch held up by roman columns greeted them ernie noticed something moving in the shadows nearby the fly peered at it oh it horse he exclaimed the horse walked towards them out of the shadows ernie saw it was goodsized palomino wellgroomed wearing bridle something looked bit odd about it but in this light ernie could nt tell what it was but then he did nt really know that much about horses anyway the horse approached them hi there the horse said in deep drawling voice sterno started talking horse the horse started talking dog ernie sighed talking horse right guess might have expected something like that what next there was time when all of this would have seemed very unusual to him perhaps even startling now however it was getting kind of routine the horse regained its composure say have any of you guys seen my friend wilbur around here the fly regarded the horse carefully you know this horse looks very familiar that voice sounds familiar too the horse tossed his mane oh maybe you ve seen my tv show my name is mr ed sure cried the fly gleefully used to love that show he began to sing horse is horse of course of course will you please stop singing that stupid song snapped sterno irritatedly ve always hated that song you do nt like the theme song asked mr ed incredulously but everybody likes the theme song it one of the most popular parts of the show well do nt sterno barked mr ed pawed the ground well guess that all you can expect from talking dog sterno glared where come from we grind up animals like you and feed them to our pet humans mr ed whinnied let not get personal now hmmph sterno fell silent well said the fly hesitantly liked the theme song thank you said mr ed glad somebody here has some taste gee it really neat to actually meet mr ed the fly enthused you know always thought your voice was like special effect or something what asked the horse you know like dubbed or something the fly explained mean thought you were nt really talking why would you think thing like that mr ed wondered thought occurred to ernie say mr ed he said to the horse what are you doing in ancient rome anyway mr ed tossed his mane you know he said thoughtfully was just asking myself that very question ernie narrowed his eyes suspiciously that did nt seem to be very satisfactory answer to him let go inside shall we suggested sterno the smoke from that burning village is bothering my sinuses good idea said mr ed and led the way they crossed the romanstyle marble porch walked through an open atrium with gurgling fountain in the middle of it and came to huge oak door covered with iron studs inside was 1950s style suburban living room complete with blond furniture and freeform coffee table ernie frowned you know somehow this looks out of place to me captain memory sighed now the history of the world database is all screwed up too somebody teacher gon na be really mad about this ernie continued to frown you notice that we come across an awful lot of fiftiestype stuff how come we do nt get forties stuff or seventies stuff how come it always fifties stuff captain memory sighed and dropped heavily into the green fiftiesstyle sofa oh sure there logical explanation for it just ca nt think of it at the moment mr ed pawed the ground nervously say you re not suspicious or anything are you there nothing to be suspicious of everything perfectly safe somehow this reassurance failed to make ernie feel any better mr ed pointed his muzzle towards large floor model fiftiesstyle television set say you wan na watch some tv no ernie was not ready to cope with any more tv mr ed seemed taken aback you do nt have to shout he said in hurt tone clopping off to the other side of the room aww now you hurt his feelings said the fly accusingly he set off to try to console mr ed captain memory was pulling some objects out of hidden pockets in his costume ah here it is he said producing his favorite item the tv guide ernie felt his stomach grumbling he was getting really hungry by now he had nt gotten anything to eat back at the gingerbread cottage when the others were stuffing their faces he was beginning to really regret that now he noticed an open door at the other end of the living room and decided to go and investigate it through the door was typical suburban kitchen his eyes immediately fixed on one object the refrigerator he threw it open excitedly unfortunately it was empty except for box of baking soda maybe there would be something in the freezer ernie opened the freezer door and started back in horror there frozen into immobility was the most hideous disgusting totally alien monstrosity that ernie had ever seen one of it tentacles or pseudopods or whatever they were was frozen into the ice cube tray another seemed to be reaching for box of popsicles ernies stomach turned over and he slammed the freezer door in disgust ernie ran back into the living room there the most awful thing in the freezer he exclaimed excitedly oh yeah captain memory was nt actually paying attention yeah ernie went on agitatedly it some kind of weird alien thing and it frozen into the ice cube tray oh yes sterno commented calmly aliens in the ice cube trays we get them all the time rather nuisance unsanitary do nt you know what must you always shout sterno said reprovingly have very delicate hearing you know oh um sorry ernie was embarrassed apparently noone seemed to consider the alien very important sterno thought moment were there by any chance some popsicles in that refrigerator ernie was surprised uh yeah there were how did you know that oh yes sterno continued they re always found with popsicles you know that why they come to earth we believe to steal popsicles but then they accidentally step into the ice cube tray in the quick chill section and get frozen stiff was nt that movie the fly chimed in momentarily breaking off his conversation with mr ed the word movie caught captain memory attention oh yeah sure the fly went on enthusiastically remember that now the thing it was 50 science fiction movie about this alien frozen into the ice at the north pole great movie captain memory agreed with james arness as the thing thought james arness was marshall matt dillon on gunsmoke said the fly puzzled mmm hmm captain memory agreed but he was also the alien imagine that the fly shook his head wonderingly marshall matt dillon was an alien no wonder he was so quick on the draw ernie fidgeted anxiously so what should do about it about what sterno asked only half paying attention the alien ernie cried please winced sterno putting his paws over his ears oh sorry ernie lowered his voice that better sterno lowered his paws just do nt thaw it out leave it do nt thaw it out sterno repeated emphatically ernie considered this why would aliens steal popsicles he wondered because they have nt any money suppose sterno mused they ca nt buy them if they have nt any money now can they suppose they ll just have to steal them then uh ernie felt unsatisfied by this line of reasoning they ca nt very well just go out and get jobs now can they sterno continued after all who hire an alien mcdonalds would you really want to buy hamburger from an alien ernie thought about the frozen alien and his stomach flipped over again um no well that proves it then sterno leaned back triumphantly ernie sighed and sat down on the sofa the others all seemed absorbed in their own pursuits ernie fidgeted uncomfortably his stomach growled he was beginning to get ravenously hungry he looked at the kitchen door maybe he could try the kitchen one more time the kitchen looked lot like something out of 1950s better homes gardens magazine it was painted in cheerful colors with castiron trivets hanging on the walls as decorations ernie would have found it quite homey if he had nt known that there was thing in the freezer avoiding the refrigerator he walked over to row of cabinets and began rummaging through them the contents of the cabinets turned out to be disappointing there were none of ernie favorite foods he looked through the containers hearts of toad no poisonberry yogurt dont think so what this ernie grabbed box of what appeared to be peanut brittle great he thought love peanut brittle he was just about to tear into it when he noticed the label cockroach crunch he put it back gingerly he decided that perhaps he was nt all that hungry after all ernie was just about to give up and go back into the living room when he noticed familiarlooking object on the counter nearby he looked at it more closely it seemed to be an old 1950sstyle coffee maker it seemed to ernie that he could sure use cup of coffee right now he examined it more closely hey this is bakelite genuine bakelite this must be one of the first coffee makers ever made what treasure plastic collectors would pay fortune for this he picked it up and carried it into the living room hey guys ernie announced look what found captain memory started as he saw what ernie was carrying wow where you get that ernie was excited it was just sitting on the counter in the kitchen do you know what that is captain memory enthused thats psion megaforce generator wonder what it doing on this planet ernie heart sank does this mean not going to get cup of coffee captain memory continued to enthuse wow psion megaforce generator right here right in our own living room sterno who up to this point had not been paying any attention looked up irritatedly what what kind of nonsense are you going on about now it psion megaforce generator ca nt believe it the captain seemed really enraptured by it just ca nt tell you how thrilled am about that sterno yawned or rather could but rather not be impolite so instead why do nt you just tell us what this thing is supposed to be it psion megaforce generator the captain was indeed very excited sterno sighed okay we understand that now why do nt you just calm down and tell us what it supposed to do captain memory seemed taken aback do sterno spoke each word slowly and carefully as though talking to small child what is it supposed to do captain memory shifted uncomfortably hmmm lem me think uh used to know that used to know all that stuff sterno repeated himself speaking even more slowly and carefully as though to someone who did not speak english very well what is it supposed to do ernie examined the device he turned to captain memory are you sure this thing is really psion megaforce generator oh absolutely the captain looked very relieved that someone had broken the awkward silence then how come it says mr coffee on it it mr coffee brand psion megaforce generator whats wrong with that the captain wanted to know ernie was becoming more and more skeptical so how come it says makes 14 cups drip grind only well uh sure there logical explanation for that captain memory said evasively just ca nt quite think of it at the moment ernie narrowed his eyes suspiciously are you sure this isnt coffee maker uh captain memory stopped suddenly his eyes lit up ve got it now remember of course why did nt think of it now remember what psion megaforce generator is supposed to do sterno was not impressed okay what it makes coffee captain memory cried out triumphantly ernie set the coffee maker on the table and sat down on the sofa rubbing his head wearily why did everything always have to be so complicated captain memory looked around at everyone obviously disappointed sterno was pointedly looking in another direction the fly was talking to mr ed ernie was wearily cradling his head in his hands noone seemed to be greeting the captains announcement with much enthusiasm of course could be wrong the captain said tentatively noone answered ernie began examining the coffee maker he was nt quite sure how to work an old model like this he turned it over there seemed to be some directions on the bottom but the were all covered with coffee stains and were practically impossible to read he would probably just have to figure it out himself wait minute the captain said urgently ernie looked up now what it just occurred to me that uh captain memory looked embarrassed maybe the psion megaforce generator does nt make coffee after all so what does it do instead make tea um no the captain looked uncomfortable think it uh destroys planets ernie gave the captain disgusted look there uh is nt any place to put peanut butter in that thing is there the captain asked intensely ernie examined it no nothing about peanut butter no little door or compartment or anything ernie looked it over nope the captain seemed relieved okay okay forget that forget said anything about peanut butter absolutely sure that it uh destroys planets or makes coffee it for sure either destroys planets or makes coffee captain memory beamed pleased with himself for having solved this difficult problem ernie examined the machine more closely there was lever on the top which was labelled mild on one side and full on the other he also found twoposition switch on the side there were little words printed next to each position unfortunately the ink had rubbed off of them and they were very difficult to read ernie peered closely he was nt sure but the positions seemed to be labelled brew and destroy ernie sighed he was rapidly losing interest in the entire subject idly he flipped the switch instantly the earth rumbled the building shook ernie hastily flipped the switch back again sterno turned to ernie irritatedly who did that did you do that uh yeah well you could at least excuse yourself sterno snapped oh sorry somehow ernie always seemed to wind up feeling that he was at fault captain memory was beaming well that settles that doesnt it it destroys planets was right all along of course was ernie regarded the device ruefully he noticed small faded tag on the side which read warning follow instructions carefully the manufacturer assumes no responsibility for damage to planets due to failure to follow said instructions such failure will also void your warranty ernie sighed there goes my cup of coffee captain memory returned to consulting his tv guide an object on the coffee table caught ernie attention it was small rectangular object wrapped in paper he picked it up it seemed to be candy bar ernie stomach started grumbling again he was feeling very sorry for himself at the moment he had nt had anything to eat for very long time how come everybody else got to eat but not him he could nt even get cup of coffee he unwrapped the object it looked like candy bar it smelled like candy bar wave of guilt suddenly came over him he probably should nt eat it it probably belonged to captain memory but then on the other hand maybe it had been on the coffee table all along and he just had nt noticed it ernie brightened in any case that sounded like good excuse to him he took bite quite tasty although it did have an odd crunch he ate the rest of the bar and tossed the wrapper under the sofa ernie was beginning to feel somewhat better suddenly the telephone rang ernie looked at captain memory captain memory looked at ernie well the captain demanded uh the telephone ringing said ernie uncomfortably are you going to answer it the captain wanted to know um you want me to answer it well it on your side it was indeed sitting on an end table right next to ernie thought they did nt have telephones in ancient rome said ernie uneasily for god sake answer the telephone already cried sterno that ringing is driving me crazy ernie picked up the phone yo cried the voice on the other end ernie ross right uh yeah answered ernie uneasily he was nt expecting to get any calls in ancient rome dis is vito we got little matter to discuss about uh 19541277121331203229 plus interest you know what mean we re gon na get dis money you know what mean so uh are you gon na make it easy on yourself and give it to us now or are we gon na have to get it outta you like da hard way well look got this problem ernie began desperately you tink you got ta problem now vito interrupted it aint nothin compared to the problem you gon na have if you do nt pay up well ernie tried again look vito broke in comin to get da money punk and you better have it or else he hung up ernie turned to captain memory maybe we should go someplace else he suggested okay said the captain agreeably where ernie concentrated know he said brightly how about we go to the middle east and look for the dead sea phonograph records sterno moaned not that again the captain looked doubtful it kind of long walk ernie frowned ca nt you just transport us there well you know do nt really like to do that too often answered the captain there always certain amount of risk with these locations changing all the time there always chance of fatal error creeping in and okay okay said ernie quickly forget said it okay have it your way said the captain agreeably ernie sighed all of this was just too much for him if only we had some kind of vehicle or something spaceship or even car captain memory looked thoughtful oh you want spaceship you have spaceship ernie cried well it just little something take out on the weekends the captain explained modestly it no big deal mean it does nt have kitchen or portajohn or anything its just for short hops like around the solar system or something it called the luna lunacy sterno inquired oh no captain memory laughed the luna why ernie was curious well you know after the luna and the luna there the luna captain memory explained so what happened to the luna and the luna sterno wanted to know captain memory suddenly became very quiet after few moments he muttered well well it was nt my fault ernie frowned what was nt it was stupid place to put planet anyway captain memory went on suddenly indignant mean how was supposed to know there was planet in that sector nobody would ve expected planet to be in that sector planet ernie asked incredulously well okay okay captain memory continued defensively maybe was little way out of the spacelane it could happen to anybody couple of lightyears this way or that couple of light years sterno inquired okay okay captain memory seemed very illatease so maybe had couple of drinks big deal mean was at party right what do you want me to do just stand around all night okay so maybe should nt have been doing warp in warp zone so made little mistake big deal mean what am supposed to do pay for this the rest of my life or what let me get this straight sterno said you hit planet at warp it was stupid place to put planet captain memory repeated petulantly it should ve had guard rail or something so what happened ernie asked incredulously oh captain memory looked at the ground hadda pay for it you had to pay for planet well had insurance the captain said brightly um that is had insurance he trailed off sterno caught the drift you do nt have insurance any more captain memory looked very uncomfortable well my premiums kind of went up sterno thought for moment you said there was luna and luna that accounts for one of them what happened to the other one captain memory fidgeted ca nt we talk about something else sterno rolled his eyes upward so are you going to be flying this spaceship well uh no the captain began thank heavens sterno broke in would mean could captain memory continued just as soon as get my license back sterno sighed so what are we supposed to do wait no no the captain said reassuringly they gave me pilot sterno breathed sigh of relief so where is this spaceship ernie asked excitedly he was really looking forward to the prospect of seeing real live spaceship left it parked up in orbit the captain explained want me to call it down sure okay the captain began looking around where my remote control had it here minute ago ernie began looking around as well what does it look like oh it about so captain memory motioned with his hands to indicated rectangle about six inches long it wrapped in white paper ernie began to feel uneasy what color was it under the paper that is the captain was still looking around it brown and kind of soft the captain looked under the sofa that funny here the paper from it but it all crumpled up and the remote is gone ernie began to get real bad feeling in the pit of his stomach um was it by any chance uh chocolate well sure after all it was either that or strawberry the captain laughed could nt very well have strawberry remote could ernie moaned quietly uh think know what happened to it sterno looked at ernie aghast you did nt ernie nodded sadly sterno turned to captain memory he ate it captain memory looked at ernie incredulously how could you eat remote control unit well ernie was embarrassed actually it was pretty good suddenly disturbing thought occurred to him say its not poison or anything is it captain memory looked thoughtful do nt know nobody ever eaten one before he thought moment guess we ll find out wo nt we ernie moaned quietly well well if they re gon na make remote control unit that looks like candy bar they ought to put warning on it or something they did captain memory answered did nt see any warning cried ernie indignantly all saw was piece of blank white paper that the warning the captain explained it means dont eat this remote control unit in franglian franglian you know like they speak on the planet franglia captain memory acted as though this were perfectly obvious to everyone but nobody on earth speaks franglian ernie protested captain memory considered this well then guess it not much good is it he pulled out his tv guide hey you wan na watch some tv ernie stomach was beginning to feel very bad indeed actually watching tv was about the last thing he wanted to do but considering the looks everyone was giving him at the moment he thought perhaps he had just better keep his mouth shut the fly and mr ed returned from the other side of the room mr ed seemed to have cheered up considerably hey what on tv the fly asked captain memory let me see the captain leafed through the pages wan na watch movie how about beach blanket chainsaw massacre irate viewers get sick of aging beach stars and cut them up with power tools with frankie avalon annette funicello lucille ball and desi arnaz maybe said the fly thoughtfully what else is on you like horror movies said the captain how about goldfish from hell suburban family discovers their pet is possessed by evil spirits with flipper lucille ball and desi arnaz nah said the fly do nt like horror movies how about gidget goes berserk gidget gets chainsaw for christmas and oh no sterno broke in simply can not tolerate gidget movies how about kungfu tigers go hawaiian with bruce lee lucille ball and desi arnaz ernie noticed something odd about the tv listings say does nt it seem little strange that lucille ball and desi arnaz are in all these different movies no do nt think it strange at all drawled mr ed do you sterno glared at ernie after all you ve done should think you be content to sit quietly and mind your own business hey you ll like this captain memory said to the fly wan na watch the miss galaxy pageant sure thing the fly enthused turn it on okay ll get up and turn it on ll have to get up because the captain glared at ernie do nt have remote ernie shrank into his seat the captain turned on the television and here our celebrity judges lucille ball and desi arnaz the camera panned in to the two celebrities that odd thought ernie they do nt look the way remember them do nt recall them having such pointy teeth oh well it probably just the lighting or something now our first contestant the girls began parading by ernie noticed that the girls in this pageant did nt look quite like the one he was used to seeing for one thing they were all lot plumper than the beauty queens at home none of them seemed to have much personality either they all looked sort of bovine is nt she delicious young lady the announcer was saying look at those scrumptious legs those mouthwatering shoulders those tender juicy thighs gee these girls are nt very cute said the fly disappointed not like at home they look positively delicious to me commented mr ed ernie looked at mr ed suspiciously that seemed to him to be very strange comment to be coming from horse but then come to think of it any comment was strange coming from horse you wan na watch something else captain memory asked the fly no no that okay said the fly quickly sure theyll get better the pageant continued our next mouthwatering contestant the camera cut to the celebrity judges they seemed to be drooling slightly little forked tongue seemed to dart in and out of their mouths or maybe it was just trick of the light ernie felt uneasy beauty pageants at home were nt like this he decided to try not to look at it he regarded the horse instead there was definitely something peculiar about that horse ernie decided it seemed to be somewhat lumpy and misshapen there seemed to be line going around its middle almost like seam why would horse have seam the new miss galaxy the shouts and applause drew ernies attention back to the television where the winning contestant was being crowned and now the celebrity judges leaned forward expectantly their broad grins revealed rows of needlesharp teeth their forked tongues flicked in and out of their mouths in anticipation it carving time the announcer whipped out whirring chainsaw and advanced on the hapless miss galaxy who struggled feebly while the two runnerups held her in place oh man the fly complained told you do nt like horror movies they give me the creeps let watch something else he changed the channel commercial was on the new station man was sitting behind desk looking deadpan directly at the camera the phone on the desk began to ring does your heart sink when the telephone rings the man said because of bill collectors constantly threatening you about unpaid debts hmm ernie thought as matter of fact it does why not call acme debt counseling service the commercial continued we ve helped millions avoid the nightmare of bad debts we ll set up payment plan you can afford and get those bill collectors off your back once and for all call today that an idea ernie thought do nt know if it ll work but it worth try maybe they can keep vito away long enough for us to get out of here at least he picked up the phone and dialed the number that was displayed at the bottom of the screen acme debt counseling service woman voice answered yeah just ernie began ah mr ross man voice cut in we ve been expecting you have your file right here in front of me oh ernie was taken aback how could they have known he was going to call you ll be pleased to know that we ve worked out very convenient payment plan to take care of this matter the man continued the collection agency has agreed to accept the payment plan and has agreed to call off vito who was on his way to well we rather not say what vito was going to do but anyway you do nt need to worry about that now everything is all taken care of ernie heaved sigh of relief this collection agency business was really beginning to bother him they seemed to be able to find him no matter where in time or space he was he was really glad that he was nt going to have to worry about it any more we ve broken this down into small easytoafford weekly payments the man on the phone continued now if you ll just send in the first week payment in cash of course the man laughed you ca nt expect us to accept check from someone with your credit history we ll get the ball rolling on this um how much is the payment ernie asked hesitantly only 41286594543 week the main exclaimed glowingly hey do nt thank us it our job uh um ahem ernie cleared his throat nervously the man on the phone stopped there was an awkward silence you re not going to tell us you do nt have 41286594543 are you uh well ernie began um do nt exactly have that much on me right now that is if you could give me little time couple of years maybe the man on the phone sighed oh that is unfortunate well there may still be something we can do ll have to talk to my supervisor about this please hold the man voice disappeared and tinny muzak came over the receiver in it place ernie sighed well he had nt really thought that was going to work anyway still maybe they could come up with something yet he waited listening to lowfidelity versions of 1950 pop hits played by the million and one strings ernie sighed again he hated being left on hold after what seemed very long time the man voice reappeared good news he exclaimed cheerfully my supervisor said we may still be able to work something out ernie breathed sigh of relief great the man continued my supervisor says that if you do nt have the cash right now we might be able to accept something else of value instead like what ernie could nt imagine what he might have with him that would be worth 41286594543 oh do nt know just some little thing the man said evasively like maybe your brain my brain ernie shrieked now now do nt get excited the man said soothingly after all what one little brain among friends you ll never miss it forget it ernie slammed down the phone mr ed shook his head sadly think you should have taken that deal he advised forget it not going to give them my brain he glared at the horse what business is it of yours anyway hey the fly interceded do nt pick on mr ed he stroked the horse nice horsey why not give them your brain sterno suggested you never use it ernie glared leave me alone ernie looked at the tv blackandwhite images of lucille ball and desi arnaz were on the screen lucy seemed to be upset about something what are we watching anyway more love lucy reruns captain memory looked at the tv guide that funny this is supposed to be movie called nazi cheerleaders from planet ernie looked at the tv oh yeah who in it captain memory consulted the tv guide let me see uh lucille ball and desi arnaz ernie frowned dunno it looks an awful lot like love lucy to me ernie thought moment does nt it strike you as just little bit odd that absolutely everything on tv right now has lucille ball and desi arnaz in it no do nt think that odd at all said mr ed in his typical lowvoiced drawl why should nt lucille ball and desi arnaz be in everything they re probably the two greatest performers who ever lived huh ernie did nt know how to answer that in fact mr ed went on rapturously say that they are definitely the finest performers that show business has ever produced the greatest that ever could be produced in fact in all of time and space noone anywhere in the universe could possibly even approach the greatness of lucille ball and desi arnaz oh come off it snapped sterno irritatedly they re just couple of secondrate tv actors ay carramba mr ed cried furiously what chu talkin about dey de greatest especialmente desi arnaz de greatest cuban bandleader in de world ernie looked at mr ed suspiciously hey what happened to your voice where did you get that cuban accent mr ed was flustered hey man uh oh something very peculiar seemed to be happening to mr ed he seemed to be writhing in very unhorselike manner suddenly mr ed fell in half both halves lay on the floor each writhing independently ernie was stunned he stared at the two halves of mr ed jaws open with astonishment suddenly head covered with rolled red curls popped out of the back half of mr ed oh uh hi guys it was lucy lucy turned to the front half of mr ed which was still writhing on the floor oh ricky told you to let me be the front half of the horse now look what happened voice came from the front half of mr ed lucy stuck in dis horse suit help me out okay the front half of mr ed thrashed wildly filling the room with the sound of thuds and maracas lucy struggled out of her half of the horse suit and ran over to help ricky however the more she tried to help him the more tangled up he got the fly looked ruefully at the horse suit poor mr ed ernie turned to captain memory now what the captain was still reading his tv guide how about she devils of green gables with shirley temple and he was interrupted by loud pounding on the door open up they all looked up startled the pounding came again open da door punk know you re in dere lucy turned to ricky who was still stuck in the horse suit oh ricky it vito let him in will you maybe he can get our brain from that awful ernie person she glared at ernie ricky struggled in the horse outfit you got to get me out of here he cried distressed ca nt see nuttin in dis suit ernie turned to captain memory think we ought to get out of here okay the captain continued to peruse his tv guide oh you ll like this one funny thing happened on the way to attila the hun with zero mostel and ernie paced anxiously look we ve got to do something all these people are after my brain sterno shrugged call the police ernie started the police that was worth try he grabbed the phone and dialed 911 ernie fidgeted impatiently while the phone rang he heard the sound of the phone being taken off the hook you got ta help me he began he stopped the voice on the other end was recording were sorry all of our officers are busy at the moment if you re being murdered please leave clue and one of our detectives will contact your nextofkin as soon as possible thank you and have nice day ernie slammed the phone down disgustedly vito pounded on the door again open up ernie looked apprehensively at ricky who was still struggling to get out of the horse suit look really think we ought to get out of here like now captain memory looked up in annoyance well if you re going to be that way about it he got up and strode across the living room and through an open doorway which seemed to lead into the kitchen hey wait for me cried ernie chasing after him as he ran he grabbed the psion megaforce generator he was nt about to leave fortune in precious bakelite behind he continued to follow the captain he did nt know where captain memory was going but he figured it would have to be an improvement the captain walked through the next room which was the typical suburban kitchen opened typical suburban back door and stepped outside ernie and the others followed quickly behind him they found themselves once again standing in countryside of green rolling hills the village in the distance seemed to have burned itself out and only feeble wisps of smoke were rising from it awfully glad we got out of there commented sterno it was really getting dreadfully noisy my ears are very sensitive you know the fly was the last of the group to leave the villa he shook his head sadly poor mr ed it must have been real shock to him falling in half like that ernie considered trying to explain the situation to him but decided it was nt worth the trouble he turned to captain memory now what captain memory looked around nice day is nt it ernie tapped his feet impatiently think it would be good idea if we went someplace else they re going to be coming after us any minute now not after us sterno corrected after you ernie frowned yeah they want my brain they do nt want your brain sterno thought about this and decided he was offended well that just shows what those silly aliens know if they knew anything about brains at all they realize mine is clearly superior an idea occurred to ernie yeah you re right maybe should tell them sterno frowned you know think we should go someplace else it suddenly become awfully boring around here nice day for walk do nt you think said captain memory strolling off towards the yellow brick road the others followed quickly chapter after few minutes walking the four travelers through cyberspace began to see an encampment of some kind in the distance what do you suppose that is ernie wondered dunno commented captain memory want to turn around and go the other way ernie thought of lucy ricky and vito all of whom were somewhere behind them no let just keep going it does nt really matter which way we go commented sterno after all all roads lead to rome ernie thought about that it seems to me that would cause lot of traffic problems he said reflectively the fly peered into the distance somebody coming ernie started uh oh what do we do now he thought moment are they romans or huns how should know the fly answered well what are they wearing funny outfits the fly shrugged what are they supposed to be wearing ernie sighed dunno sort of hoped they be wearing togas or something the men approaching were coming into ernies range of vision they seemed to be military patrol they wore armor some kind of leggings and carried shields bows and spears so what are they the fly wanted to know romans or huns dunno ernie said might as well flip coin guess you got coin left all my money in my other pants pocket ernie admitted so just pick one then the fly urged well romans then if they re romans we could talk to them in latin do nt know what we could do if they re huns what language do they speak hungarian do nt speak hungarian do you speak latin asked sterno sarcastically well well used to watch lot of gladiator movies said ernie hopefully good enough said the fly encouragingly you go talk to them then why me it was your idea the fly returned it was not my idea never we ll just go hide in these bushes in the meantime the fly sprinted off towards little group of bushes on the other side of the hill followed by sterno and captain memory ernie saw that the soldiers had noticed him they were pointing in his direction and saying something that ernie could not make out ernie decided his only course of action was to brazen it out he bit his lip uncertainly and walked forward in what he hoped would seem like confident manner he tried to think of something to say in latin uh pluribus unum he called out gallia est divisio in partes tres they soldiers looked at him hey get load this the first soldier said it roman in funny outfit he turned to the soldier next to him hey frank gim me an arrow will ya wan na shoot this guy ernie realized that he had made serious tactical error he decided that the correct move at this point would be to beat hasty retreat turning abruptly he sprinted towards the other side of the hill halfexpecting to feel an arrow in his back at any moment as he ran he could hear little bits of the soldiers conversation drifting in his direction whaddya mean you dont got any arrows told you to save some arrows how come nobody never does what tell em ernie ran for the bunch of bushes the others were hiding in what happened the fly asked eagerly we guessed wrong answered ernie glumly well we better do something said the fly cause theyre coming this way do nt think they can find us in here said ernie hopefully oh yes they can returned sterno there trail of sequins leading right to us ernie heart sank he knew he never hear the end of this oh man said the fly you better ditch that suit its getting us in lot of trouble luckily ernie still had his fur loincloth sandals and plastic broadsword he had been afraid to discard them since after all he had put fortydollar deposit on them he quickly changed into the goombah the barbarian costume and hid the toreador outfit under rock no sooner had he finished changing then they heard voice coming from behind them hey what are you guys doing in those bushes the same group of soldiers ernie had encountered on the road was there behind them ernie thought fast uh we re looking for blueberries you guys see any blueberries around here no answered the first soldier and anyway it aint blueberry season so why do nt you guys come out of there real slow the soldiers held their spears in menacing fashion sure whatever you say ernie laughed nervously the soldiers inspected the foursome suspiciously the first soldier looked at ernie so what are you supposed to be uh goombah the barbarian ernie announced the first soldier guffawed hey frank get load this this guy thinks he barbarian the other soldiers laughed uproariously ernie sulked he did nt see what was so funny about it what did he say his name was asked frank gumby gumby the barbarian the soldiers all laughed hysterically lookit this he got plastic broadsword real tough guy he doubled over with laughter the first soldier gradually composed himself say he said wiping tears of laughter from his eyes you did nt see roman in funny suit go by here did you he left trail of sequins that led right in here ernie thought fast again uh as matter of fact yeah he went thataway ernie pointed down the road the soldiers looked in that direction aw we might as well forget it we ll never get him now the second soldier looked at ernie so what are we gon na do with gumby here at the mention of the name gumby the soldiers all started laughing hysterically again gumby the barbarian huh the first soldier commented after he had stopped laughing to the point that he could speak again well joe the hun he said introducing himself this here frank the hun and back there that pete the hun he looked at the foursome what weird bunch guess we better take all you guys to the boss who the boss asked ernie attila the hun answered joe that figures ernie thought ernie decided that maybe he would go along and meet attila the hun especially since he could nt see any alternative at the moment the foursome headed off down the road in the direction of the burning village escorted by the hun soldiers after few minutes walk they entered the encampment of the huns the soldiers led them to large tent where they were ushered into the presence of an imposing figure large heavily muscled man in armor sat or golden throne leaning on huge broadsword attila king of the huns soldier announced attila regarded the foursome carefully why have you brought these creatures before me he demanded in thunderous voice uh well sir said joe the hun timidly we did nt know what else to do with them he started to giggle this one he pointed at ernie he says his name gumby the barbarian he put his hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter attila regarded ernie seriously is that correct he demanded sternly uh actually it goombah ernie said timorously attila erupted in thunderous laughter that great gumby the barbarian that hysterical he turned to the soldiers you guys dressed him up like this for joke right no it for real joe protested we just found em like this attila doubled over with laughter wiping the tears from his eyes he turned to the fly hey lookit this guy mask its really weird that not mask the fly was offended that my face attila erupted into hysterical laughter again he says its his face that cracks me up the laughter was contagious all the soldiers were doubled up with laughter too hey gumby attila chortled what are you gon na do with that plastic broadsword you gon na loot pillage and rape well uh ernie stammered uh not exactly sure how to do that besides uh do nt you need license for that or something attila broke up again license to loot love it these guys are hysterical sterno was getting annoyed this is getting bit tedious he complained attila jaw dropped wow talking dog what great act get it now you guys are traveling clowns right you re part of circus right captain memory looked perturbed he seemed to be sensitive about being called clown is that an insult attila collapsed in laughter again is that an insult he says and he says it with straight face you guys really crack me up the foursome shifted about uncomfortably while attila buried his face in his arms laughing uncontrollably after what seemed to be very long time attila looked up tears of laughter still streaming down his face say you guys are just great we ve been doing so much raping looting and pillaging that it just not that much fun anymore what really need these days is good laugh feel lot better now he thought moment think ill give you guys reward he turned to ernie how about bag of gold would you like that ernie considered that yeah guess that would be nice owe kind of lot of money right now and ve been having lot of problem with bill collectors attila chuckled yeah had lot of trouble with bill collectors too but solved that problem wan na know how yeah ernie was excited maybe he could use this solution for his billpaying problems attila chuckled chopped their heads off you should have seen their faces he thought moment in fact think still have them around here somewhere wan na see em ernie grimaced no that okay not supposed to look at severed heads it makes my stomach hurt at this attila collapsed into helpless laughter again you guys are just laugh minute just when think ve heard it all you come up with another one ernie frowned none of this seemed very funny to him at all you huns really have strange sense of humor attila brow furled we do huh he said menacingly sterno and the fly turned to look at ernie ernie shuffled uncomfortably it occurred to him that maybe he should nt have said that broad grin appeared across attila face that funny like it ernie heaved sigh of relief suddenly messenger ran up to the king of the huns your magnificence we found these strangers lurking around the edge of the camp ernie looked behind him hun soldiers were dragging forth three struggling captives the first was someone ernie did not recognize beefy man in an illfitting suit the other two were lucy and desi oh vito lucy said to the beefy man make them let us go oh my gosh said ernie involuntarily attila looked at ernie sternly do you know these people uh sort of ernie admitted they re uh bill collectors attila face lit up bill collectors my favorite oh what fun let see he paused reflectively shall we boil them in oil or flay them alive maybe we could boil them until theyre tender and then flay them or maybe he strode off to examine his new captives leaving ernie and the other alone looks like you ve solved the bill collector problem sterno said to ernie uh yeah guess so decided ernie so why do nt we get out of here before attila decides to do something like that to us too oh he would nt do that the fly said attila likes us ernie watched as attila fingered lucy red curls lucy bit him attila drew his sword ernie decided he did nt want to watch what came next just the same let go okay what the matter said sterno tauntingly do nt you want to see what attila going to do to them uh just as soon not all right let just go okay sterno continued to look back looks like lucy losing her head over attila he said smirking ernie stomach turned over again he had nt really felt very good ever since eating that remote control unit he was sure he did nt want to see anything that might make him feel worse attila strode back to his throne his huge broadsword dripping bright red blood gee that was fun he sighed well guess got ta get back to business who am supposed to see next three representatives of the king of the parthians your majesty an attendant told him oh yeah what are their names larry moe and curly the attendant answered attila thought moment are they funny believe so sire well then let see em with that the foursome found themselves ushered out of the tent the four of them stood outside attila tent well now what the fly wanted to know that good question captain memory began yes sir that okay okay ernie cut him off he did nt want to hear that whole thing all over again let just get out of here okay everybody keeps pointing at us and laughing sure enough as they looked around they noticed the passing huns all pointing the foursome out to each other and making what ernie was sure were snide comments ernie in particular was getting very sensitive about snide comments made at his expense let go guys okay he urged they began walking down the yellow brick road heading out of the hun camp soon they were out of the camp and heading once again across the green hills the road rolled on before them over hill and dale heading towards rome maybe the road seemed to stretch on endlessly in front of them ernie sighed it looked like it was going to be long walk after what seemed to be very long time they noticed something up ahead of them it seemed to be huge cloud of dust heading across the countryside whatever it was it was going to cross the road short distance in front of them ernie strained his eyes can you make out what that is he said to the fly oh wow said the fly it cattle drive do nt be ridiculous snapped sterno cattle ca nt drive no no the fly protested it cows whole bunch of cows herd of cows ernie corrected of course ve heard of cows snapped sterno do nt be insulting well they re coming this way the fly said as the four walked along they began to make out more clearly vast number of cattle raising huge cloud of dust with their hooves what are all these cattle doing here ernie wondered as if in answer to that question lone figure on horse came galloping toward them hey it cowboy the fly said cheerfully hiya cowboy he waved the cowboy galloped up to them and stopped howdy any of you boys know the way to abilene ernie looked around uh sorry stranger here myself the cowboy scratched his head this country do nt look at all familiar we ai nt seen thing we recognize fer quite spell now yall know where this here road leads ernie thought moment uh think it leads to rome but im not sure the cowboy considered that rome is that in kansas do nt think so ernie said the cowboy stroked his horse muzzle well toto he said to his horse do nt think we re in kansas anymore he turned back to ernie well thank ya ll kindly he said tipping his hat he galloped back to rejoin the herd ernie turned to captain memory what do you make of that tsk tsk the captain shook his head the file corruption is getting really severe more and more data is turning up in the wrong sector really do nt know if the system is going to be able to stand much more of this ernie found this comment disturbing why what ll happen then the captain shook his head sadly well well it might he trailed off ernie hated it when people trailed off it always made him terribly uneasy it might what he prompted captain memory looked uncomfortable are you sure you want to know ernie thought about this for moment and decided the captain was right he did nt want to know the fly however had become interested in the subject oh get it we re supposed to guess right he said brightly first syllable sounds like he began gesticulating in peculiar way as though trying to act out some unknown word this is fun sterno grimaced will you please stop making those disgusting motions ca nt even begin to tell you how utterly offensive they look the fly paid no attention know know it movie star right he began prancing about in very disconcerting manner is it dancer huh dancer well no captain memory looked very uncomfortable know know the fly jumped up and down excitedly its fred astaire right fred astaire uh no captain memory shifted about awkwardly gene kelly the fly shouted excitedly it gene kelly right uhuh the captain looked at the ground for heaven sake tell him already snapped sterno nothing else is going to shut him up ernie winced he really did nt want to hear this if it was bad enough for captain memory to warn him about it must be really terrible especially considering all the terrible things the captain had told him without warning him he shuddered no he definitely did nt want to hear this captain memory looked very unhappy it uh know know the fly was totally involved with the game carmen miranda it carmen miranda right captain memory sighed it well it total system failure the fly was totally taken aback huh sister failure whos she he sulked it not fair to use people who are nt famous how am supposed to guess that what movies has she been in anyway ernie sighed with relief system failure well that wasnt that bad he frowned it suddenly occurred to him that he might feel differently if he had any idea what system failure was what he started to say then stopped on second thought perhaps he rather not know what in the world is total system failure supposed to be sterno demanded irritatedly captain memory sighed that when you totally exceed the operating parameters of the system to the point where not even the multipleredundant neuralnet backups can compensate for it any more huh ernie was nt following that well captain memory simplified it sort of like the system has heart attack ernie thought about that and if the system has heart attack then we have heart attack sterno finished for him ernie moaned quietly he had feeling it was going to be something like this why did they have to tell him this anyway what was he ernie supposed to do about it what did they have to tell him if there was nt anything he could do about it his stomach hurt he decided to try to think about something else their path was now blocked by the herd forcing the foursome to cool their heels and wait for the animals to pass they waited while thousands of cattle went by raising huge cloud of choking dust finally the herd passed and the four continued on their way they walked for what once again seemed very long time finding nothing finally the fly noticed something seems to be something going on up ahead he commented looks like chariot pulled over by the side of the road as the foursome approached they could see that it indeed was chariot four romans in togas stood around it tire on one of the wheels seemed to have gone flat and they were pumping it up with hand pump ernie frowned are chariots supposed to have tires the fly looked at the chariot hey it got oldfashioned skinny tires on spoked wheels like model ford what do you expect dunno ernie was trying hard to remember what the chariots looked like in the gladiator movies however he hadnt been paying attention that closely with all the stuff that been happening you ca nt be too careful do nt be such worry wart snapped sterno suppose it is phony chariot what difference does it make uh ernie had nt thought that far ahead his thoughts were interrupted by one of the romans who approached them he was tall thin man wearing toga he seemed like typical roman out of gladiator movie except for the fact that he wore monocle and jackboots the man arm swept out in roman salute heil mean hail he said cheerfully ernie frowned were nt romans supposed to wear sandals the man continued ve chust finished fixing our chariot perhaps you vould like ride ja you bet said the fly enthusiastically boy really sick of walking well dunno said ernie something about this just did nt seem right to him he looked at the two white horses that the chariot was hitched to carefully examining them for any sign of seams or lumpiness no they looked okay perfectly formed with no seams one thing did seem odd about them though they didnt move at all they stood absolutely still like statues but then on the other hand ernie did nt really know that much about horses maybe they were supposed to stand like that it probably didnt mean anything oh come on said sterno impatiently quit making such an issue about everything let just get in all right ve had it with walking bet you must be dog tired right said the fly spare me your attempts at humor you insectile moron sterno barked the fly looked upset what did he mean by that he said to ernie time to go urged the roman all aboard ja sterno and the fly quickly scrambled aboard the chariot which seemed unusually large and spacious to ernie he got on as well in spite of his misgivings captain memory brought up the rear the other three romans then got on behind them blocking the entrance and making any escape impossible ernie felt very uneasy about that he was however relieved to see that captain memory did not seem the least bit bothered by the situation but then captain memory did nt seem the least bit bothered by any situation vell avay we go said the roman cheerfully giddap he snapped the reins nothing happened the horses stood there totally immobile the roman laughed nervously giddy up he lashed the horses with the reins still nothing from somewhere in his toga he produced riding crop and began lashing the horses unmercifully you vill move you shtupid animals the horses stood absolutely still totally unresponsive the roman turned to the foursome with nervous laugh liddle problem nothing to vorry about no need to get out he jumped over the side of the chariot and approached the horses menacingly uh herr sturmbannfuhrer one of the other romans spoke up there is something ve forgot to tell you the first roman gave the closest horse swift kick in the hind leg the leg broke neatly off the roman jumped frantically out of the way as the horse toppled slowly over and crashed to the pavement shattering into million pieces the first roman turned on the other romans in fury idiots he shrieked you brought ze plaster horses told you ve must have ze real horses but but herr sturmbannfuhrer the second roman sputtered ze real horses zey make doodoo on ze floor dummkopf shrieked the first roman how can ve travel vith plaster horses the other three roman looked at each other in dismay oh ve did nt tink of dat idiots the first roman lashed the others with his riding crop oh man said the fly sadly does this mean we re gon na have to walk after all the first roman stopped abruptly and turned to the foursome with bright smile oh no of course not dis is chust minor problem ve fix in chust moment the roman pulled some sort of small electronic device out of his toga and scanned the surrounding area with it it beeped ah ze solution to our problem is coming right down ze road an object appeared over the horizon moving quickly down the road in their direction as it approached ernie could see that it was large chariot pulled by four beautiful white horses it looked somehow familiar the four romans stood in the middle of the road blocking the path as the chariot aproached the man in the chariot stopped confused you the first roman shouted out of ze chariot now he pulled an evillooking weapon out of his toga and pointed it at the man in the chariot menacingly make way make way the man in the chariot cried out have no time to waste on my way to the chariot races in rome the man in the chariot looked very familiar to ernie could it be charlton heston have no time to vaste either the first roman fired his weapon at the man in the chariot who vanished in flash of flame now he turned to ernie and the others ve vill take zis chariot ja oh man said the fly mournfully they re ruining all my favorite shows first mr ed falls apart and now they disintegrate benhur even sterno was now beginning to get suspicious say he said to the first roman what your name anyway my name the first roman seemed nonplussed you vant to know my name yeah ernie picked the question up what your name the first roman laughed nervously he elbowed the second roman sharply quick he whispered vot my name the second roman whispered something to him the first roman smiled agreeably oh yes my name am marcus provolonicus sterno froze in horror provolone it cheese oh my god it cheese run the other three romans suddenly whipped out evillooking weapons do not move shrieked the first roman or you vill suffer ze same fate as our friend here he gestured towards the other chariot which now contained only little pile of ashes the first roman tore off his toga revealing nazi ss uniform underneath so our liddle subterfuge does not fool you eh he said menacingly dat is most unfortunate for vhich he looked around quickly his eyes came to rest on the second roman you vill pay dummkopf he lashed the man with his riding crop but herr sturmbannfuhrer the man began silence shrieked von liederkranz it is impossible to get good help zese days he sulked ze quality of ze cyberslaves is not vhat it used to be he turned to ernie and the others now you vill get on zis chariot and ve vill be on our vay ernie looked at von liederkranz evillooking weapons and decided to do it the nazis way they boarded the other chariot this time the horses worked and they moved off quickly down the road hey this sure beats walking said the fly cheerfully as they thundered along the yellow brick road dunno said ernie ruefully considering where were going maybe we rather walk ernie frowned say he said to von liederkranz where are we going anyway von liederkranz smiled evilly you ll find out soon enough ernie looked on ahead they appeared to be approaching something oh it town said the fly vot von liederkranz snapped dere not supposed to be town here whoa he stopped the chariot vhere my map he pulled out map and began regarding it carefully ah here de problem ve get on ze autobahn und turn left at heidelberg the other romans had removed their togas as well and stood revealed as nazi ss troopers one of them peered over von liederkranz shoulder uh herr sturmbannfuhrer he began tentatively dat map of bavaria von liederkranz started he looked at the legend of the map and then crumpled it up angrily and threw it on the ground know dat he snapped vas chust testing you very good he prodded the ss trooper with his riding crop okay mr knowit all vhere do ve go now the trooper regarded the road carefully vell since deres only one road and dis is nt de right vay vould say ve go de other way von liederkranz thought minute uh right de other vay ve go de other vay he wheeled the chariot around and they galloped off in the other direction they charged on down the yellow brick road in the direction from which they had come in the first place moving faster this time as von liederkranz whipped the horses badtemperedly after some time they began to approach what seemed to be town oh wow said the fly it the same town how did we get to the same place when we went the opposite direction told you so smirked sterno all roads lead to rome you re just going to have to go there there just no getting out of it von liederkranz peered ahead gottverdammter vhere my map he pulled out another map and regarded it carefully ah here ze problem ve chust get on i94 turn right at indianapolis the ss trooper looked over von liederkranz shoulder again uh herr sturmbannfuhrer dat map of illinois von liederkranz started he quickly crumpled up the map and threw it on the ground know dat he turned to the rest of the group ve are going to zis town ve intended to go to zis town it vas not mistake they continued down the road and into town the town consisted of one unpaved road flanked by one story wooden buildings with broad fronts their names were clearly legible on them saloon general store us marshal the town looked somehow familiar to ernie oh wow exclaimed the fly it dodge city that impossible snorted sterno you ca nt have all roads lead to dodge city that not right have classical education and know could be abilene suppose mused ernie all roads lead to abilene said sterno sarcastically fat chance you must be right ernie agreed do nt see any cattle around must be dodge city after all as they passed through town ernie noticed tall thin young man who looked at them with alarm the young man began hurrying towards the us marshal office walking with pronounced limp mr dillon mr dillon somethin strange comin into town he cried tall imposing man dressed in western attire and wearing us marshal badge stepped out of the marshal office and into the street blocking the path of the chariot hold up there now what do you boys want in our town get out of my vay hissed von liederkranz haff no time for dis shtupidity now hold on just minute there the marshal began idiot snapped von liederkranz he turned to the ss troopers disintegrate him von liederkranz and the ss troopers reached for their evillooking weapons with lightning speed the marshal gun flew into his hand four shots rand out catching each of the nazis full in the chest the force of the bullet hurling their bodies from the chariot seen it mr dillon cried chester the young man with the limp they drew first ernie threw his hands up over his head do nt shoot were unarmed sterno get down on all fours woof he said emphatically they do nt shoot dogs do they they were holding us prisoner the fly chimed in they shot benhur ben who the marshal looked confused just then woman in an elaborate red dress ran out of the saloon oh matt are you all right heard the shooting do nt you worry miss kitty just fine the marshal reassured her ernie looked at the ground behind him the bloody bodies of von liederkranz and the other nazis were lying motionless in the dust ernie turned to captain memory are they really dead oh yes said captain memory cheerfully too bad they wont stay that way huh ernie was confused well you know how it is in computer games the captain went on if you get killed you just start over again with another life dunno they looked pretty dead to me ernie said look again the captain advised ernie turned the bodies had vanished see the captain said they ve gone back to the beginning they ll have to start all over ernie turned back to look at the marshal who had been conferring with miss kitty and chester you boys are free to go the marshal said just stay out of trouble he went back into his office whew the fly breathed sigh of relief boy are we lucky to get out of that one you do nt want to mess with marshal dillon sterno stood back up and brushed himself off trying to recover his lost dignity you can put your hands down now he said to ernie snappishly you have no idea how ridiculous you look surrendering when there noone there oh ernie lowered his hands he looked around so what are we gon na do in dodge city the fly looked at the saloon look at all those pretty girls in there whaddya say we go in for drink well okay ernie could nt think of any reason not to besides his throat was feeling pretty dusty after that long chariot ride they got out of the chariot and walked towards the saloon the fly leading the way they walked up to the doors when suddenly their way was blocked by burly bartender hold it right there boys we do nt allow no injuns in here huh the fly was confused that means you the bartender prodded the fly in the chest imagine that trying to come in here with feathers he gestured toward the fly antenna and war mask he gestured towards the fly face the dancehall girls laughed derisively hey wait minute the fly protested not shotgun suddenly appeared in the bartender hands said git he said menacingly now okay okay the fly backed off gittin and do nt come back the bartender called after them the fly sighed as the foursome walked back to the chariot aw gee never get to have any fun chapter the foursome walked slowly back towards benhur chariot suddenly the lead horse reared up whinnying loudly and the four horses galloped out of town as fast as they could run the empty chariot bouncing along behind them ernie was totally taken aback by this hey they started up all by themselves he said as the cloud of dust raised by the horse hooves drifted over them can they do that well obviously they can sterno sneered and it all your fault my fault ernie coughed why is it my fault because it always your fault sterno snapped you didnt tie them up me ernie protested did nt know you had to tie them up ca nt you just like turn them off or something sterno rolled his eyes upward hopeless captain memory looked up at the bright afternoon sun nice day for walk do nt you think ernie looked down the road it seemed to stretch endlessly through scrubby dusty semidesert landscape it looked exactly like the scenery he seen in hundreds of episodes of gunsmoke it did not look like pleasant place for walk maybe we could just stay here he suggested hopefully just then marshal dillon stepped out of his office you boys better get movin before you get into more trouble he said sternly want you out of town before sunset ernie sighed well okay maybe we wo nt stay here then the foursome started off down the road occasionally glancing over their shoulders to see if the marshal was still watching them unfortunately he was after what seemed like hours they approached fork in the road one branch seemed to head off into the mountains and another into the valley they stopped ernie looked at both branches of the road well which way do we go the high road or the low road know the fly chimed in brightly you take the high road and ll take the low road why because then ll be in scotland afore ye the fly beamed gim me break moaned ernie wait minute captain memory interrupted what maybe the captain could come up with something that would get them out of this desolate landscape is nt it supposed to be you ll take the low road and ill take the high road the fly frowned no sure it supposed to be you take the high road and ll take the low road captain memory shook his head no think it the other way around no it ca nt be the fly answered listen he started to sing you ll take the high road that enough already sterno broke in what difference does it make anyway we re not going to scotland ernie looked around okay then where are we going rome stated sterno confidently all roads lead to rome ernie regarded the landscape skeptically dunno rome that in italy right this does nt look like italy to me it looks like he stopped like what sterno demanded like well well do nt know what it looks like but it does nt look like italy it pointless to argue with me said sterno pompously because have classical education and am therefore always right are nt there supposed to be like grapes and pizzas and people playing those little accordions ernie wondered noone paid any attention to him the fly looked down the road into the valley and up the road into the mountains okay so which way do we go then it does nt matter said sterno selfimportantly all roads lead to rome the fly started up the road into the mountains you guys can go any way you want he called back over his shoulder but im going this way why ernie called after him cause then ll be in scotland afore ye the fly laughed and started running last one there is rotten egg ernie turned to captain memory and sterno well he said at last guess we might as well follow him ll say captain memory agreed would nt want him to be in scotland afore me the three of them turned and began walking up the road into the mountains the road headed upward at moderate angle making walking somewhat difficult they began to notice the terrain around them changing as they walked they seemed to be moving into cooler moister environment the desert was giving way to cool alpine meadows the road narrowed into path threading it way between the growing hills actually ernie thought it kind of nice here maybe taking the high road was good idea they had not seen the fly for quite some time but they were fairly confident that he was just bit out of sight ahead of them since they could hear someone singing ll take the high road in the distance suddenly the singing stopped ernie frowned he hoped the fly had nt fallen over cliff or something he strained his ears no no singing suddenly he heard another sound did you hear that he said to sterno of course said sterno assuredly ernie frowned what did that sound like to you believe it was yodellayhehoo sterno replied ernie knitted his brow in concentration ve heard that before that reminds me of something like what asked sterno with slight air of sarcasm fondue perhaps chocolate watches heidi ernie brightened switzerland we re in switzerland very good applauded sterno go to the head of the class ernie frowned again so what are we doing in switzerland captain memory shrugged we seem to have wandered into somebody geography program so now what we go on to rome of course sterno answered confidently ernie looked at the rising mountains and alpine meadows around them are you sure we re going the right way mean are we supposed to go through switzerland to get to rome of course said sterno with great assurance do nt you remember hannibal taking his elephants through the alps on his way to rome hannibal ernie face lit up with recognition saw that movie starring victor mature right ernie looked at the narrow path on which they stood and frowned what are we gon na do if we run into an elephant on this trail at that moment they turned corner and came upon the fly who was standing still looking at something hi guys he said take look at this the trail at this pointed rounded curve at the top of cliff the fly pointed over the side into the valley below there was some sort of commotion going on in the valley there seemed to be large crowd of some sort moving through the valley carrying torches ernie peered into the valley there were lot of people or animals or something moving around but he could nt make out what they were doing another cattle drive he suggested doubt it remarked sterno look at all those torches must be torch drive the fly said brightly sterno glared at the fly and muttered something unintelligible those torches sure are pretty are nt they commented captain memory maybe we should go down and join the party ernie could hear some kind of chanting drifting up from the valley he strained to hear what they were saying it seemed to be something like oom alla boom he frowned somehow he just didnt like the look of that crowd uh maybe we better not he countered sterno agreed with him maybe another time the dog suggested captain memory looked at the others you guys are no fun he complained the foursome watched the commotion below for few minutes and then continued along the trail the narrow trail wound along between huge boulders making it impossible to see very far ahead the foursome passed through narrow opening and found themselves facing large open field which seemed to stretch on for miles in the middle of this space was large englishstyle mansion surrounded by carefullytended grounds the foursome approached it low ornamental fence surrounded the grounds road led through the fence and up to the front door lacking any better ideas the foursome walked down the road and up to the front door the door was massive and imposing with huge cast iron door knocker in the middle ernie looked at captain memory captain memory looked at the fly the fly looked at sterno sterno looked at ernie ernie looked around everyone was looking at him ernie sighed and stepped up to the door tentatively he raised the knocker and let it drop it made surprisingly loud sound ernie flinched he waited nothing happened try it again sterno demanded ernie frowned why do nt you try it he had bad feeling about this place it looked like someplace he had seen in movie sometime he did nt remember what movie it was or what happened but it was something bad well obviously not tall enough to reach it said sterno patronizingly anyway it your job why is it my job cried ernie indignantly why is it always my job you started it retorted sterno ernie sighed he knew there would be some reason why it was his job he always got stuck with things like this who knows what kind of horrible creature would answer the door even if it was normal person what was he supposed to say to them anyway oh well might as well get it over with he raised the knocker and slammed it down several times raising tremendous din that noone in the house could have missed they waited nothing happened well nobody home said ernie lightly guess we might as well go oh come on snapped sterno irritatedly where are we supposed to go anyway try the doorknob ernie shifted the coffee maker to his other hand and gingerly touched the huge castiron doorknob half expecting an explosion or an electric shock nothing happened he tried to turn it it was very securely locked and totally unmovable well door locked said ernie in cheerful tone might as well go we ll find another way in said sterno sternly let walk around the building ernie grimaced the others however seemed content to follow sterno as he headed off around the corner to the left ernie supposed there was no way to get out of this so he followed as well bringing up the rear small garden path led around the corner of the building through the english garden and to nicelytended stone patio french doors led from the house to the patio just as thought sterno declared he strode purposefully up to the doors and tried the knob they were unlocked he led the way into the house they found themselves in luxurious englishstyle study the walls panelled with dark oak and lined with shelves containing leatherbound books sterno headed immediately for small occasional table by the wall aha he cried knew it he flipped open dark wood box revealing store of excellent cigars he grabbed handful of them lighting one immediately ahhh he exhaled cloud of blue smoke his eyes lit upon decanter sitting next to the humidor lovely he exclaimed brandy anyone ernie sighed wearily all this stress was just too much for him he decided luckily there was large overstuffed victorian sofa placed in the middle of the room ernie dropped heavily onto it followed by captain memory and the fly captain memory scanned the room slowly wonder where they keep their tv he said pensively the sofa faced to large oak doors which ernie supposed must lead to the rest of the house ernie considered them wondering if they should try to explore the house further no he decided lets just leave well enough alone at that moment the doors flew open in the doorway stood tall very britishlooking gentleman with white handlebar mustache wearing smoking jacket and top hat how good of you to come he announced jovially lord foofaraw do make yourselves at home tea anyone butler entered carrying silver tray full of teacups and three large covered silver dishes ernie gratefully accepted cup of tea and peeked under the covers of the dishes the first two contained unappetizing looking little ornamental sandwiches they seemed to be made of plastic or some other notentirelyedible material at this point however ernie was so ravenously hungry he would have eaten practically anything even items that were only marginally edible however ernie decided to check the third dish what luck it contained large pile of fresh hot sizzling lamb chops broiled to perfection ernie loved lamb chops he grabbed the entire dish off the tray and began wolfing them down eating them with his bare hands as ernie hunger subsided he began to feel selfconscious they seemed to be having an elegant english tea with titled british nobleman and here he was wearing fur loincloth carrying plastic broadsword and coffee maker and eating lamb chops with his bare hands it did nt seem proper to ernie certainly it was very unbritish ernie frowned then on the other hand it wasnt his fault lord foofaraw was the one who served the lamb chops they should nt serve lamb chops if they do nt want people to eat them and anyway they did nt give him any utensils so he had to eat them with his hands that settled ernie returned to stuffing his face with chops pip pip cheerio eh wot said lord foofaraw jovially how very british exclaimed sterno delightedly rather agreed lord foofaraw ernie turned to the nobleman wonder if you could tell us where we are he managed to ask between bites where you are lord foofaraw seemed amazed why should think that would be quite obvious you re here old boy sterno chuckled the fly waved his antennae confusedly captain memory continued to look around for tv lord foofaraw settled comfortably into an overstuffed chair ah yes he began this reminds me of the time was lost in the jungles of poodawumpus surrounded by cannibals he leaned forward animatedly there were cannibals to the right of me cannibals to the left of me the light of their torches flickered through the dense undergrowth could hear their infernal chanting oom alla boom oom alla boom over and over until thought the infernal din should surely drive me mad suddenly he broke off looking at ernie oddly say my good man why ever are you carrying that coffee maker ernie fidgeted uncomfortably it not coffee maker its psion megaforce generator wot the lord was amazed psion megaforce generator ernie repeated lord foofaraw looked at him skeptically ernie looked again at the device he was carrying he sighed on the other hand it could be coffee maker too suppose ernie admitted anyway it genuine bakelite ah yes bakelite the lord seemed to consider this answer reasonable faraway look came into his eyes that reminds me of the time was trekking through the desert of duzzlebuggy but what about the cannibals the fly broke in his antennae waving excitedly do nt interrupt his lordship snapped sterno lord foofaraw looked confused say old man there are no cannibals in the deserts of duzzlebuggy the fly antennae drooped disappointedly wanted to hear about the cannibals oh dear the lord seemed quite flustered by all these interruptions where was ah yes there was scaling the mountains of muffiedump ernie mind wandered he noticed beautiful silver bell sitting on an end table next to him it seemed to be very unusual design it was covered with dozens of tiny pushbuttons each with an odd little symbol next to it ernie picked it up curiously bong bong loud synthesized bellsounds appeared as though out of nowhere lord foofaraw looked up in annoyance stopping his story in midsentence say my good man whatever are you doing ernie looked up disconcertedly um it the bell continued to bong loudly how rude sterno glared at ernie ernie examined the bell frantically trying to figure out how to turn it off he could see now that is was nt real bell but rather an electronic synthesized bell with orchestral sounds rhythm machine and full midi capability ernie pushed the tiny buttons frenziedly desperately trying to turn the thing off the sound changed chickaboom chicka boom ernie had accidentally turned on the rhythm machine the door to the study opened the butler entered swarthy character who looked somehow familiar to ernie the sound abruptly stopped ernie breathed sigh of relief the butler looked at ernie and then at lord foofaraw chu rang he enquired ah yes lord foofaraw seemed to have regained his composure more tea richard chure the butler said agreeably and began refilling their cups his lordship resumed his story and there was surrounded by technosavages they had decided to sacrifice virgin but the first one they selected was discovered to be how shall say damaged so they were obliged to move on to the next who became virgin 20 but she was found to be not entirely suitable so they settled upon virgin 21 revised it seemed to have gotten dark outside although they had hardly noticed it since the butler or someone had turned on the lights that was odd ernie thought because it had been the middle of the afternoon only few minutes ago he was going to consider it further when abruptly the lights went out plunging them all into total darkness from out of nowhere gust of wind blew up throwing the french doors open violently suddenly shot rang out they heard cry and body fell heavily to the floor the lights came on again there in the middle of the persian carpet lord foofaraw lay dead in pool of blood nearby lay smoking gun ernie was stunned before he could even think of what to do the oak doors leading to the rest of the house flew open and man in trench coat and fedora strode purposefully in scotland yard he announced noone leave this room crowd of bobbies seemed to have materialized outside of both sets of doors clearly noone was going to be able to leave this room until the detective was ready to allow it ernie frowned this was beginning to remind him an awful lot of some movie or other although he still could nt remember which one it was oh remember this captain memory exclaimed delightedly this is game called mystery you know one of those whodunnit things we have to solve the mystery the captain seemed very pleased this is great fun the detective scanned all of their faces carefully so here we all are at last he said at last ernie thought uh we only just got here ernie said tentatively wiping his greasy hands on his fur loincloth and we really do nt know anything about this so if you dont mind we ll just be on our he started to get up sit down shouted the detective noone leaves until say so ernie sat he had nt really thought he was going to get away with that but he though he give it try anyway so the detective continued we know you all had reason for wanting lord foofaraw dead the foursome all looked at one another ernie shrugged captain memory shrugged the fly shrugged sterno shrugged in very undoglike manner well actually ernie began tentatively no likely story interrupted the detective here you are wearing fur loincloth and plastic broadsword carrying he cocked an eye quizzically at ernie coffee maker and you expect me to believe story like that and just where did you get that bag of gold anyway ernie began to feel very selfconscious he decided that perhaps he had better keep his mouth shut it did nt seem to him that saying attila the hun gave it to me would go over very well and what about those lamb chops the detective thundered everyone knows that one never serves lamb chops for tea so just what is the meaning of all this ernie shrank down into his seat and you the detective jabbed finger at the fly who flinched you blamed lord foofaraw for your terrible accident did nt you the accident that left you horribly disfigured and left lord foofaraw free to start an affair with your wife but but do nt even have wife the fly began his antennae waving in consternation all these years you ve plotted revenge have nt you the detective continued and now suddenly mysteriously lord foofaraw turns up dead what are we to make of that my fine fly friend but but the fly antennae waved wildly the detective however had already gone on to the next suspect and you he jabbed finger at sterno you ve had no reward for years of faithful service have you you ve worked like dog running and fetching every time his lordship snapped his fingers we know how you resented it how you longed to even the score yet year after year you let his lordship treat you like an animal with never whimper of complaint and now here you are helping yourself to his lordship best brandy and cigars what would his lordship have thought of that sterno thought fast woof he answered the detective however had already gone on to the next suspect and finally the detective said leaving pregnant pause we have you he jabbed finger in captain memory face the famous captain memory through space and time without dime think you ve been heard to say actually sort of prefer through time and space to better place answered the captain conversationally likely story snapped the detective we know what youve been up to we see you when you re sleeping we know if youre awake we know if you ve been bad or good so be he stopped abruptly glancing suspiciously about him never mind the question here is just exactly how do you jump out of sectors that are nt supposed to accept any external commands anyway captain memory frowned what does that have to do with lord foofaraw you know very well what it has to do with the case snapped the detective just answer the question suddenly light went on in ernie head he suddenly remembered how all the pieces fit together know he shouted the butler did it the butler blanched hey mon he cried out what chu talkin about don do nothin the detective looked irritated do nt change the subject he snapped he turned back to captain memory awright youse guys talk youse guys ai nt gon na play me for patsy ernie and the fly looked at each other in confusion the detective continued you lousy twobit gunsels think you can take rod and one of the bobbies came in hurriedly tapped the detective on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear what the detective snapped he laughed nervously oh right british detective he laughed again pip pip cheerio eh wot ernie frowned there was something very suspicious about this detective for one thing his large britishstyle handlebar mustache did not seem to be attached to his face very well it was slowly drooping off one side of his face there was something funny about his clothes too the trenchcoat was okay the hat was okay maybe it was the jackboots sterno gave the detective pitiless glare you lost your character he accused the detective laughed nervously character vot character not character uh he looked flustered he elbowed the bobby next to him quick he whispered who am the bobby whispered something in his ear the detective seemed to recover his composure somewhat oh yes of course the famous british detective thomas cheddar sterno fur stood on end oh no it cheese cheese run he wailed but it was too late the detective whipped an evillooking weapon out from under his raincoat which parted to reveal black ss uniform beneath it enough of zis shtupidity he cried holding the foursome at bay you vill perhaps recognize me now he said confidently he screwed monocle into one eye and whipped off the false handlebar mustache with flourish he immediately regretted this and winced with pain as the glue on the false mustache tore out half the hairs of his real mustache he quickly regained his composure however and waited for some response from the foursome captain memory looked at ernie ernie shrugged the detective looked from one to the other you do recognize me ja he asked bit uncertainly sure we ve seen you someplace before said sterno patronizingly of course agreed captain memory it on the tip of my tongue it uh he trailed off the fly antennae waved uncertainly suddenly he brightened oh get it it game right first syllable sounds like he began gesticulating wildly know know it fred astaire right fred astaire enough the detective shouted angrily can not believe dat you do not recognize me sturmbannfuhrer dr heinz von liederkranz de most famous nazi in all televisionland obviously you haff recognized me all along and you are chust toying vith me vell he smiled evilly ve shall see who toys vis who sterno frowned whom he corrected vot snapped von liederkranz whom sterno continued it not who toys with who its who toys with whom von liederkranz monocle dropped out of his eye was fur ein shtupid language haff no time for dis we must get on vis de questioning he smiled evilly okay said captain memory agreeably why do fools fall in love nein dummkopf von liederkranz shrieked ask ze questions the fly sulked why do you always get to ask the questions how come we never get to ask any questions quite right sterno asserted and why must you always wear that dreadful uniform von liederkranz stopped startled uniform vot wrong vis my uniform mean really sterno sniffed it hardly the thing for high tea is it should think top hat puttink on top hat von liederkranz asked incredulously white tie tails sterno went on puttink on white tie the nazi seemed amazed putting on the ritz the fly shouted joyously finishing the line of the song knew it knew it was fred astaire von liederkranz drew himself up to his full height ja do look great deal like your fred astaire nein of course he did nt look anything like fred astaire but noone wanted to be the one to tell him that oh yes sterno enthused insincerely you ve all the elegance all the grace of the greatest dancer of all time von liederkranz preened ja dat right do looking down he noticed lord foofaraw top hat which had rolled off his head when he collapsed dead he picked it up tossing his own military cap aside using lord foofaraw top hat and his own riding crop as cane he attempted to do fred astairestyle top hatandcane number he began to do few awkward shuffling dance steps puttink on mein top hat he began to sing the bobbies had by now shed their english policeman uniforms to reveal their nazi uniforms beneath they were totally confused by this turn of events they shuffled about awkwardly not knowing what to do von liederkranz glared at them sing he commanded the nazi lined up and formed chorus line swaying with the music singing off key puttink on mein white tie von liederkranz attempted to do some slightly more complicated steps but succeeded only in knocking over the silver tray sending the tea cups and little plastic sandwiches crashing to the ground this threw the other nazi off their rhythm half of them swayed left and half swayed right causing them to violently bump into each other knocking some off their feet their voices trailed off sing von liederkranz commanded ferociously the nazi resumed singing with feigned enthusiasm puttink on der ritz knew it the fly enthused knew it was fred astaire that means win right von liederkranz and the nazis began dancing gracelessly towards the door that led to the hallway singing dum de dum de dum dum since they could nt remember the rest of the words bravo sterno applauded enthusiastically keep it up you re doing great von liederkranz grinned broadly and began dancing with greater enthusiasm although no better rhythm he headed out the door and down the hall the nazi chorus line crowding awkwardly behind him fabulous sterno enthused he signalled to ernie the fly and captain memory who caught the hint and began applauding as well wonderful tremendous they all cheered the nazi voices began receding down the hall sterno gestured towards the french doors leading to the outside the four got up and began tiptoeing towards them suddenly the heard resounding crash coming from down the hall dummkopf schweinhund cried voice followed by the snap of riding crop run cried sterno the foursome charged through the french doors and went sprinting across the field behind the house in few moments the english tudor mansion was out of view peculiarly enough as soon as they left the mansion it was mid afternoon again the darkness seemed to have been confined to the study the four slowed down to walk exhausted and out of breath ernie looked back there was no sign of pursuit looks like they re still trying to get their act together captain memory commented that act has got let say few rough spots that need to be ironed out sterno snickered think they re going to be working on it for rather long time ernie sighed with relief those nazis made him very uneasy the four continued walking they were in the midst of what seemed to be many acres of lush grassy meadow short distance ahead ernie spotted flock of sheep peacefully grazing sheep ernie exclaimed really sterno asked sarcastically how clever of you to figure that out small group of sheep detached themselves from the flock and walked up to the foursome ernie noticed that they looked much like the other sheep in the flock except for the fact that they were wearing dark sunglasses looking closely he could see that some of them seemed to be carrying some objects that looked lot like hmm well like surfboards baa the first sheep said as if in greeting baa baa sterno replied the sheep seemed to respond favorably to this you speak their language ernie was astounded of course sterno replied offhandedly was always great student of foreign languages but what language do they speak ernie wanted to know sheepish of course sterno replied in patronizing tone everybody knows that the lead sheep continued baa baa baa ba inquired sterno baa baa baa the lead sheep repeated vigorously second later the next sheep repeated the same thing baa baa baa and then the next sheep picked up the refrain soon they were all chanting baa baa baa suddenly the lead sheep launched into the main verse baa baa baa baa barbara ann oh it the beach sheep the fly exclaimed by now the entire group of sheep had launched into the song in full chorus they re not bad admitted ernie even the president likes the beach sheep the fly asserted of course they re not really the beach sheep sterno explained they re not the fly seemed very disappointed do nt be silly sterno sniggered you could nt expect the real beach sheep to be performing in little outoftheway meadow like this could you the only play the really big fields nowadays aww the fly antennae drooped no continued sterno they re just one of whole flock of beach sheep impersonators good imitation but not the real thing ernie thought moment you mean like elvis impersonators the sheepish equivalent sterno agreed having finished their song the beach sheep began discussing something with sterno in very serious tones ernie of course could nt understand bleat of it since it was all in sheepish so what the deal the fly wanted to know it seems the sheep have problem sterno explained they re being oppressed by one of their own kind cruel tyrant who will stop at nothing to get his own way gee that tough the fly shook his head sadly what this tyrant called anyway ernie was curious sterno paused dramatically they call him the wooly bully ernie frowned that name seemed somehow familiar to him the fly started snapping his fingers and humming wooly bully wooly bully will you stop that barked sterno have some respect please this is serious problem oh sorry the fly fell silent sterno continued conversing with the sheep they re asking our help in breaking free of this awful tyranny wooly bully that reminds me of something captain memory became thoughtful the hully gully perhaps the fly antennae perked up the frug the jerk the mashed potato he suggested the swim sterno added or even the twist brilliant idea occurred to ernie know this must be the land of 1000 dances sterno turned to ernie with look of utter disgust look we ve been through this before remember fondue chocolate watches heidi remember ernie became subdued you re trying to tell me this is switzerland right the fly antennae twitched excitedly oh remember that now land of 1000 dances that was song by cannibal and the headhunters cannibal ernie started he thought for moment on the other hand he went on switzerland is fine chocolate heidi fine just fine well sterno sniffed glad that settled captain memory looked at his wrist watches did you say watches ernie looked at the sheep he noticed that each of them wore rather nice swiss watch on one of their front forelegs captain memory continued to look at his bare wrist and sighed oh dear afraid it getting late we ll have to be going ernie was nonplussed are nt we supposed to like help them overthrow the evil ruler or something captain memory shrugged it not my problem you know mean we ca nt do everything baa baa said the lead sheep insistently the sheep wants to know sterno translated if you cant help overthrow the wooly bully could you at least give him some clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter she been missing since yesterday and he afraid something terrible might have happened to her the poor little lamb ernie burped everyone turned to look at him uh who me do nt know anything about it why would know anything about it he fidgeted uncomfortably compulsively wiping his stillgreasy hands on his fur loincloth stop looking at me like that think we better get going said captain memory decisively now the four turned to leave ernie looked back at the group of sheep he smiled weakly trying to think of something nice to say in sheepish ba he waved goodbye the lead sheep started and rose up on his hind legs looking very angry and offended that was very rude sterno reproved ernie uh what did say asked ernie bewildered only meant after all sterno continued you ve never even met his mother and even if you had seriously doubt she would have consented to do anything like that with you gee sorry ernie decided that perhaps the safest thing to do was simply be quiet the four continued walking ernie noticed that it seemed to be getting warmer substantially more humid too even though he was wearing only loincloth ernie began to perspire the others also seemed to be feeling uncomfortable from the heat all except captain memory who never seemed to be uncomfortable at all as the sun began to set ernie noticed that the vegetation around them was different now the warm area they were heading into seemed to full of tropical plants lush flowers and tall trees loomed ahead of them in fact they seemed to heading into jungle ernie noticed an object lying in the grass it appeared to be the broken remnants of vandalized sign of some sort ernie could just barely make out few words through the layers of graffiti pooda something ernie read no alcoholic beverages allowed do not feed the the rest was gone something about it made ernie feel very uncomfortable um is it really good idea to be heading into the jungle at night ernie asked nervously oh you re right said sterno sarcastically let just check into holiday inn instead well it just that it awfully well dark ernie fidgeted it gets that way at night sterno pointed out you know of some way to prevent it perhaps ernie eyed the thick jungle vegetation ahead of them with misgivings what if there um hostile natives or something at that exact moment drums began pounding in the distance ernie began to feel very uneasy do we have to go in there he pleaded no not at all captain memory pointed out we can just stay here and wait for the nazis to catch up with us if you like ernie moaned no that okay let just keep going captain memory shook his head sadly dunno nothing seems to make you happy you do nt want to go you do nt want to stay you know you really need to have more positive attitude yeah right ernie grunted they continued along the way into the jungle the vegetation seemed to swallow them up the heavy masses of green foliage on all sides seemed to offer little possibility of escape the continued along the trail which became ever narrower as they progressed look the fly pointed ahead it was now almost night the jungle before them was almost pitch black however off to the left small points of light could be seen weaving and bobbing in and out of the foliage in the distance what that ernie wanted to know fireflies torches the fly corrected it those villagers we saw in the mountains they ve come to meet us is nt that nice ernie was still uneasy are you sure they re friendly villagers the fly peered into the distance they sure look friendly it looks like they re having party they re all singing and dancing as the villagers approached ernie began to be able to make out what they were singing they were chanting rhythmically to the beat of the drums na na na na na na na na na ernie frowned know that song it um it sure the fly broke in land of 1000 dances what great song aha cried ernie see told you was right he turned to sterno see this is the land of 1000 dances was right after all you were not sniffed sterno that was there this is here that was switzerland this is the land of 1000 dances ernie sulked well was sort of right anyway this is the land of 1000 dances so those guys with the torches must be he suddenly turned pale cannibal and the headhunters cool agreed the fly great band huh what are we gon na do wailed ernie suddenly they were distracted by loud crashing in the forest behind them gottverdammter schweinhund the crack of riding crop could clearly be heard they turned to see bright fingers of white light as though from highpowered flashlights probing through the foliage zey must be in here somevhere they heard voice call out ze trail of isotope tracers from ze radioactive lamb chops leads right zis vay ernie pressed his hands to his stomach do nt feel good he moaned ernie looked up to find the other three glaring at him how was to know the lamb chops were radioactive he protested loudly do you think would have eaten them if knew ssh the four heard the voice behind them call out tink hear zem ernie quickly put hand over his mouth up ahead the bobbing torchlights were weaving ever closer the pounding drums and chanting was getting louder the chanting had changed now oom alla boom ernie could hear oom alla boom from behind the searchlights were weaving ever more in their direction slowly beginning to focus in on their position ernie whimpered quietly hey guys look at this the fly pointed to something in the darkness off to the right visible only to the fly huge insect eyes faint trail split off from the main path let try this the fly hurried down the trail the others followed as closely as possible so as not to get lost in the increasing darkness the four scampered along the dark narrow path attempting to move quickly but also quietly and not doing very good job of either the sounds of pursuit behind them seem to grow ever louder the trail led to large clearing and then stopped surrounding the clearing was an impenetrable thicket of thorn bushes in the middle of the clearing was large iron pot big enough for all four of them to fit into at the same time it sat on large pile of neatly arranged firewood heap of neatly cutup potatoes and carrots lay nearby do nt like the looks of this ernie moaned he turned to captain memory ca nt you get us out of here he pleaded captain memory frowned he seemed lost in thought well suppose it worth try he said dubiously with that he turned suddenly and slugged ernie in the stomach hard oof ernie doubled over in pain hey what beep beep beep ernie was astounded at the sounds coming out of his mouth good captain memory cheered it still works ernie coughed what what still works the remote captain memory seemed particularly cheerful just remembered that franglian remote will still work even if you eat it quality construction you know he nodded wisely paid little extra but it was worth it the captain regarded ernie carefully the only problem is it little hard to press the buttons let me see without warning he elbowed ernie violently in the kidneys ernie fell to the ground in pain he opened his mouth beep boop captain memory looked embarrassed oh sorry wrong button the toe of his boot slammed into ernie ribs boop beep there we go captain memory exulted now we ve got it ernie lay in the dirt moaning captain memory reached down to help him to his feet sorry about that he apologized still you have to expect that sort of thing if you re going to go around eating remote control units ernie staggered to his feet moaning look the fly pointed up into the sky bright object seemed to be descending in their direction captain memory looked at his bare wrist ah here he comes right on time the captain looked at his wrist more closely well almost on time as the bright object approached ernie began to make it out more clearly it looked like well it looked like an overlylarge 1957 plymouth taxi it had huge fins twotone paint and rather lot of rust captain memory gestured proudly towards it as it came in for landing there it is guys he announced proudly the luna ai nt she beauty sterno glanced behind them the sounds of commotion back on the trail were increasing not moment too soon he muttered ernie watched the luna as it approached for landing he noticed that it seemed to be coming in rather fast with deafening crash the luna slammed into the ground throwing cloud of dust and dirt in all directions as the dust settled ernie noticed hubcap rolling listlessly away finally coming to stop by nearby tree captain memory winced but then quickly regained his composure he started towards the spacecraft the driver side door of the luna opened and lanky individual with long unkempt hair got out he was wearing loud hawaiian shirt and dark sunglasses even though it was night he waved at captain memory hey dude what happenin hey ralph captain memory waved cheerily at the driver this is my pilot ralph he introduced the man to the group as they all sprinted towards the spacecraft sterno eyed the luna suspiciously this is your ship that it captain memory waved at it proudly then how come it says taxi on it sterno asked pointedly captain memory face fell well well was supposed to get limo well they told me could have limo but there was this budget problem anyway could ve had company car for sure except um there was that problem about my license so anyway he trailed off uncomfortably so you hadda take cab sterno finished for him well well flustered captain memory broke off yeah ernie noticed that the sounds behind them were getting awfully close uh could we talk about this someplace else captain memory glanced back down the trail you re right he turned to ralph let cruise ralph looked uncomfortable uh wanted to tell you dude we got little problem let talk about it on the way he suggested glancing back down the trail the guys around here are um uncool ralph nodded understandingly can dig it he got into the driver seat while the other four piled into the roomy back seat ralph shifted into fly and stomped on the accelerator the luna instantly shot thirty feet straight up into the air violently flipped upsidedown and hung there unmoving ernie sterno and the fly suddenly found themselves upside down in very uncomfortable position laying halfway on the roof and halfway in their seats captain memory and ralph however were sitting quite comfortably in their seats as though glued into them so like was saying dude ralph went on conversationally we got this little problem in the position he was in ernie could see the ground beneath them quite clearly through the luna large rear window their seemed to be some kind of commotion taking place the probing searchlights and the bobbing torches seemed to have come together ernie heard shouts screams machinegun fire then all was silent after few moments the drums and chanting began again oom alla boom oom alla boom ernie could see fire being lit beneath the huge iron pot it looked as though the cannibals were going to have their feast after all ernie attention returned to the conversation inside the space taxi ralph was telling his story animatedly so wired the framistatter to the quark generator ralph could see that captain memory was about to say something but he cut him off yeah know you re not supposed to do it know warning do not bypass overload protection who listens to that crap so anyway it really kicked up the horsepower you know what mean and when the light turned green man was outta there those guys in the vette man they could nt believe it you shoulda seen their faces it was so what happened captain memory interrupted ralph became suddenly subdued okay so maybe the left rear antimatter coupler got toasted it no biggie we ll stop at the parts store we ll pick up new one it just couple bucks it was worth it you shoulda seen those guys faces captain memory shook his head sadly got some bad news for you ralph the parts store closed oh man ralph was annoyed you mean we re gon na have to hang out until the store opens what drag ralph shook his head unhappily so like when does it open captain memory regarded his wrist carefully let see its 930 right now so would say it ll probably open in about oh two billion years oh man ralph was really upset ca nt wait two billion years got date on friday ernie whimpered does that mean the ship wo nt fly hey be cool ralph said comfortingly sure it ll fly its just little uh handling problem that all fly great just does nt uh handle exactly right it was beginning to occur to ralph that perhaps wiring the framisttater to the quark generator might not have been such good idea after all handling problem inquired sterno and he wriggled about trying to find comfortable position in the upsidedown vehicle is this part of the handling problem hey it flies fine ralph insisted so maybe it upside down mean and sideways captain memory reminded ralph oh yeah ralph became quiet sideways okay so it only goes upsidedown and sideways hey it no biggie it gets you where you re going right okay so maybe you would nt want to take any long trips in it right now but it get you uh well it gets you to the parts store he concluded triumphantly the parts store closed ralph captain memory reminded him gently the fly antennae suddenly quivered know he said excitedly how about road service can you call for tow ralph fidgeted uncomfortably well um sorta been having this problem with the towing company there this um unpaid balance ernie and the fly looked at captain memory he shrugged hey do nt got insurance you know captain memory suddenly perked up hey ralph he cried what about warp drive ralph brightened and then slowly resumed his glum expression uh well do nt think you wan na use the warp drive right now he shook his head sadly captain memory frowned why not ralph fidgeted well it been kinda acting up little he explained been meaning to get something done about it just yesterday said to myself ralph you know you really oughta get that warp drive took care of but uh you know it like fifty credits minimum just to have em look at it and uh he trailed off captain memory looked confused did nt you get the repair requisition voucher from the main office ralph looked very uncomfortable um uh yeah well the other night me and the boys was playing little cards see and had this great hand had three galaxies how could lose right but was all outta chips all had left was the voucher so said captain memory shook his head sadly that against the rules ralph ralph sighed well how was to know the other guy had five nebulae you know what the odds against that are ernie racked his brains for solution to the problem maybe we could just sort of give it try he suggested hopefully ralph sighed well thought of that but last time tried it wound up in um dimension captain memory was startled dimension oh no wonder he chuckled you sure do nt wan na wind up in dimension do you ralph nodded his head glumly that for sure they all fell silent after few minutes ernie heard the sound of snoring he squinted through the nearcomplete darkness the only light coming from the lights on the dashboard ralph seemed to have dropped off to sleep captain memory seemed to be nodding as well lacking any better ideas ernie slowly worked himself around to comfortable position and fell asleep as well chapter it was dawn when ernie awoke during the night the luna seemed to have drifted quietly to the ground and was now lying on it top in the dirt ernie peered out the windows the clearing was deserted but signs of last night revelry remained the large iron pot was tipped over on it side empty various bones lay scattered about lying here and there was what appeared to be an occasional jackboot ernie tried not to look at them after few moments the others began to stir the fly moaned oh man hate sleeping in the car look at my suit it all rumpled only sterno seemed comfortable curled up in doglike position on the ceiling of the upsidedown space taxi ernie twisted uncomfortably he was feeling very stiff and achy after sleeping in an odd position in the car thinking about it his stomach did nt feel very good either captain memory blinked confusedly and looked around ralph yawned the captain looked pointedly at ralph well he said unhappily guess there no getting around it is there oh no said ralph dejectedly you got ta do it captain memory shook his head despondently you re gon na have to call the office oh man ralph did nt seem to like this idea at all hate calling the office they always give me hard time theyll probably leave me on hold forever too captain memory shook his head sadly it got ta be done ralph ralph sighed oh okay he reached under the seat and pulled out what appeared to be car phone he picked up the handset and dialed looking very glum hi stella it ralph ernie could only hear ralph side of the conversation ralph seemed upset look stella do nt start up with me okay having bad day okay look it was nt my fault anyway got ta talk to the boss is he oh no stella do nt put me on suddenly ralph froze into immobility ernie peered at him ralph was absolutely motionless like statue he did nt even seem to be breathing ernie turned to captain memory what happened to ralph captain memory seemed unconcerned oh they put him on hold on hold ernie was uncomprehending captain memory shrugged well you know they always do that when you want to talk to the boss you ca nt expect him to drop everything just to talk to you can you the captain chuckled at the thought ernie peered at ralph he not breathing no he does nt need to he in suspended animation the captain explained yawning and stretching that way you re not aware of how much time has passed while you re waiting for your connection ernie frowned do nt think like that captain memory shrugged guess they feel it kinder that way he conjectured kinder ernie was having hard time with all of this it either that or muzak sterno explained oh ernie considered this yeah guess suspended animation would be better he looked over at ralph so how long is he gon na be like that let me see captain memory examined his bare wrist closely it ten oclock now so say oh about two billion years two billion years ernie was aghast look at the bright side captain memory went on cheerfully by then the parts store will be open ernie moaned what are we supposed to do in the meantime captain memory frowned good point we ca nt very well sit around here can we he chuckled might as well hit the road he opened the car door and flipped himself neatly around from his current sitting position which was of course upsidedown relative to the others and landed neatly on his feet on the ground outside he turned to ernie coming ernie crawled painfully out through the open car door and struggled to his feet on the ground outside the group assembled themselves outside the upsidedown taxi all of them stretching and yawning ernie peered into the interior of the taxi until he spotted his coffee maker which he carefully retrieved he stood up beside the taxi and looked about confusedly sterno seemed to have regained his composure more quickly than the other members of the group what is this office that you and ralph were talking about he asked captain memory pointedly the captain looked suddenly uncomfortable well uh you know everybody got to work for living he trailed off you mean you re not fulltime super hero the fly inquired he seemed disappointed captain memory shuffled awkwardly well uh you know super heroing does nt pay too good what exactly do you do at this office ernie wanted to know oh you know little programming the captain seemed evasive oh said sterno with relish this is beginning to make lot more sense to me now that how you manage to do all these tricky things here in cyberspace you re using the company computer you ve got mainframe to work with do nt you well captain memory seemed very uncomfortable sterno continued bet you re not running all this from pc well no the captain admitted got cray cray even ernie who knew very little about computers had heard of the awesome power of cray well it not mine personally you understand the captain began defensively in other words sterno said reflectively you re using the company cray to break into waldo stadium stolen systems and free the cyberslaves sterno eyes narrowed are nt you supposed to be doing something more productive hey this is important captain memory insisted indignantly anyway it part of you know after all could he was suddenly interrupted by the thunderous boom boom boom of jungle drums distant chanting reached their ears ernie struggled to make it out it seemed to be something like oom alla boom yum yum yum maybe we should um get moving ernie suggested uh sure the captain agreed glad to change the subject let go he began striding purposefully forward he walked right up to an impenetrable thicket and stopped looking at it confusedly how about this trail ernie suggested pointing to narrow path that led through the underbrush in the opposite direction from the trail they had come in on it was also luckily leading the opposite direction from the jungle drums captain memory snapped his fingers of course that it trail we need trail now why did nt think of that good question sterno agreed captain memory headed purposefully down the trail the others following behind him within seconds the forest seemed to close in around them ernie could see nothing around him but dense underbrush all he could see ahead of him was captain memory back he supposed that he did nt have much alternative except to just keep moving along the trail at least the sound of the jungle drums was diminishing ernie began to be aware of sound in the distance sort of whooshing sound it sounded almost like distant traffic noises he considered it it was probably just the wind in the trees he decided captain memory stopped abruptly causing ernie to just about pile into his back hmm he said peering intently forward you can get through that opening right there the flys voice came from behind as usual his hyperacute vision had spotted details which everyone else missed captain memory pushed through narrow gap in the bushes the others followed pushing through the dense brush ernie emerged on to clearing no it was lawn big mowed lawn about fifty yards ahead was large parking lot followed by huge chromeandglass office building in the distance was what appeared to be major highway from which ernie could hear what were indeed traffic sounds hey gruff voice interrupted them huh ernie looked around confusedly get outta da flower bed ernie looked down he was standing on top of dozen beautiful but crushed tulips now the voice demanded ernie rushed forward onto the grass destroying dozens more beautiful flowers in the process ernie looked back to see the rest of the group carefully picking their way forward through the flowers careful not to cause any more damage ernie looked up to see the owner of the gruff voice approaching he was short heavyset man in coveralls smoking cigar he appeared to be the groundskeeper he glanced at the group and singled out ernie look whatcha did to my flowers whatsa matter with you kids anyway you wan na use the park you follow the rules you stay on the trail you do nt go walking through the flower beds park ernie was uncomprehending poodawumpus park the gardener repeated insistently what you just came outta you stay on the trail you follow the signs you do nt be tearin up the bushes he glared at the entire group um we did nt see any signs the fly said carefully aaah the damn kids tore up the signs again little brats ll kill em the groundskeeper chomped his cigar angrily um there were these natives ernie began uncertainly yeah course there natives it nature park theres natural natives in it he looked at ernie suspiciously you did nt feed the natives didja no no ernie protested we did nt even get near em good the groundskeeper seemed slightly placated they eat what not on their diet it makes em sick he continued to regard the group suspiciously you did nt leave no junk in there didja damn kids party in there on weekends leave the trail fulla junk once hadda haul whole junk car outta there he glared accusingly at the foursome no no ernie protested we re real neat we never litter we do nt allow no dogs on the trail neither he glared at sterno sign says so right at da entrance um we did nt see the fly began yeah yeah know damn kids stole da sign awright ill letcha off dis time but next time swear gon na calla cops we re real sorry ernie began edging away it wo nt happen again the group started moving slowly in the direction of the office building yeah yeah the groundskeeper was looking ruefully at his crushed flowers the fly shook his head boy is he gon na be mad when he finds the luna sssh sterno warned what the groundskeeper turned back to them uh have nice day ernie said quickly goodbye he waved cheerfully and started walking quickly towards the office building the others followed ernie was confused why is there an office building here he asked captain memory the captain thought about it for moment looks like its somebody architecture program ve heard of that sterno commented the architects model building in virtual reality so that the clients can see if they like it or not before it actually built well we might as well take look at their handiwork the captain decided the continued over the large parking lot that lay in front of them it was almost empty only an occasional car was parked here and there they soon reached the doors of the building and entered in front of them lay small utilitarian lobby typical of cheaplyconstructed office buildings in the center of the lobby was booth marked information but there was noone manning it most of the offices appeared to be closed on the wall was directory to the offices in the building which the fly was reading carefully mostly lawyers he said ruefully we may need lawyer after all the damage he caused sterno said looking at ernie accusingly me ernie protested oh look the fly broke in there an office that open he pointed down long corridor great ernie enthused glad for an opportunity to change the subject maybe we can go in and ask he stopped and looked at captain memory expectantly uh what should we ask them good idea captain memory agreed although ernie wasnt exactly sure what it was that the captain was agreeing with the captain started off briskly down the hall in the direction of the open office the other three followed behind him ah good you re here we ve been expecting you an efficientlooking receptionist in crisp white uniform greeted them cheerfully see the fly pointed out brightly they ve been expecting us therefore we must be in the right place the fly was quite pleased with this leap of logic ernie looked around they were in large waiting room decorated in doctor office green the room was filled with rows of chairs and an occasional table on which there lay heaps of very old magazines in the background some easylistening music was playing quietly there was as usual noone else there ernie moaned oh man why would they be expecting us we re not even supposed to be here what going on the fly shook his head dunno man sometimes you can be just such downer why do nt you like lighten up little obviously sniffed sterno we must be in the right place because they are after all expecting us how could they be expecting us if we were nt in the right place but ernie began the receptionist interrupted the doctor will see you now she opened door to another room oh good the fly was pleased you know ve been having this pain in my neck he began rubbing it vigorously maybe he can give me something for it he strode purposefully through the door ernie shuffled uncomfortably hate going to the doctor oh come on sterno stood impatiently behind ernie dont be such baby about it ernie sighed and followed the fly accompanied by sterno and captain memory they found themselves in large room with dozen chairs set in circle few of the chairs were occupied in one fat blond woman sat nervously munching something from bag on her lap two chairs to the left sat very depressed looking young man wringing his hands constantly and moaning quietly he looked steadfastly at the floor never looking up little further on sat dishevelled wildeyed man who kept constantly lighting matches every time one lit he would laugh hysterically against one wall was chair that was larger than the others in it sat an older man in an old fashioned black suit he was bald with goatee beard and smoked cigar he carried notepad and seemed to be taking notes on everything that was happening he looked up ah gut he smiled at the foursome you are chust in time for ze group therapy session please sit down he gestured towards the empty chairs on the opposite side of the room from the other patients the foursome sat down ernie carefully placed the coffee maker by his side oh you must be the doctor the fly observed he looked around confusedly but what kind of doctor are you psychiatrist of course the doctor replied you have been having hmm some problems in regard to your appearance ja that right the fly was amazed he turned to the others wonder how he knew that sterno looked at the doctor cigar excitedly say you would nt happen to have an extra cigar would you the psychiatrist produced one from an inner pocket of his jacket thanks ever so much sterno lit the cigar and puffed contentedly ernie was suspicious you ve got german accent he said accusingly the psychiatrist drew himself up looking very offended dat an austrian accent he sniffed have studied in vienna with ze great dr freud himself he peered closely at ernie zo you have zis feeling zat you are being persecuted ja zat everyone is against you ernie was taken aback well um now that you mention it yeah chust as ve thought the psychiatrist said scribbling something on his notepad classic paranoia ernie was about to protest when suddenly the door opened and two more patients entered ernie looked up and then moaned it was lucy and desi hi guys lucy waved brightly to the foursome chickaboom agreed desi he seemed to have acquired new cuban shirt and another pair of maracas they sat down on the unoccupied chairs across from the psychiatrist gut exclaimed the doctor now ve are all here ve can begin he turned to lucy now lucy last veek you vere telling us about your problem oh doctor lucy exclaimed it all those tv shows from earth they re driving me crazy ach zo the psychiatrist exclaimed quietly und vhy is dat oh doctor lucy exclaimed again

agitated do nt you see weve got to do something to stop those tv signals we just ca nt stand it anymore they re driving us crazy the doctor nodded thoughtfully scribbling notes on his pad he thought for moment but you are 40 light years from here so you are just now receiving signals from 40 years ago ja yes lucy agreed tentatively zo the psychiatrist continued thoughtfully even if you stop ze signals today you vill continue to receive ze signals zat have already been sent you vill continue to receive ze earth tv shows he paused expectantly for ze next 40 years no lucy screamed she buried her face in her arms sobbing hysterically ca nt stand it just ca nt stand it she continued to sob uncontrollably ricky patted her back chicka boom he said commiseratingly the fly eyes clouded sympathetically aw gee his antennae waved in consternation hate to see woman cry sterno nodded sagely suppose can see her point he thought for moment ve always rather enjoyed lassie though thought popped into ernie head what about rintin tin not bad sterno agreed thoughtfully puffing on his cigar he looked almost like canine version of the psychiatrist and then there sgt preston of the yukon it would nt be bad show if only king could get rid of that silly fellow in the red suit mammals lucy screamed sobbing with renewed intensity the psychiatrist stroked his beard thoughtfully zere is perhaps solution yes lucy looked up expectantly her makeup streaked by tears it seemed to ernie that he could see hint of something green beneath it perhaps ze time machine the doctor seemed deep in thought ernie turned to captain memory in confusion time machine he whispered it is nt real time machine the captain explained it virtual time machine you are nt actually travelling through time but you might as well be like when we went back to four billion bc oh ernie was not exactly following this but he noticed the others glaring at him so he decided to stop the psychiatrist continued perhaps you could go back in time back 40 years und stop zese signals before zey start oh doctor lucy cried hopefully do you really think it would work stop tv cried the fly obviously very upset at the thought oh no how could we survive without tv it would be the end of of the fly tried hard to think what it would be the end of of civilization as we know it he cried triumphantly true the psychiatrist agreed pensively lucy eyes began to fill with tears but perhaps the doctor continued slowly lucy peered at him expectantly the psychiatrist went on perhaps it would not be stopped but chust changed little so dot it vould not be bother to ze space creatures lucy sat up excitedly oh yes yes she turned to ricky oh ricky we could do it know we could do it if only we had time machine the psychiatrist smiled vell as matter of fact chust happen to have one right here he gestured towards door that ernie had assumed was closet ernie was once again suspicious what would psychiatrist be doing with time machine he wanted to know oh it is chust ze thing for ze childhood trauma the doctor explained you go back in time prevent ze traumatic incident und ze patient is cured ernie had to admit that this did in fact sound reasonable the psychiatrist peered intently at ernie vhen did you first notice dat you felt suspicious of everyone ernie was somewhat taken aback by this sudden change in questioning um actually he though about it it started when first went into the virtual arcade bye guys lucy interrupted she and ricky were standing at the door of the closet or time machine or whatever it was were going into the past now so we probably wo nt be seeing you anymore take it easy cried the fly cheerfully he was relieved that lucy had stopped crying um thought occurred to ernie does that mean that you re not going to needing my brain after all lucy brow furled thoughtfully she looked at ricky he shrugged no guess you might as well just keep it ernie sighed in relief lucy continued if it turns out we need it after all we ll get back to you okay uh yeah ernie fidgeted uncomfortably he had hoped that the problem would go away completely but that seemed to be too much to expect at least he did nt have to worry about it right now lucy opened the door to the time machine she waved at the foursome see you uh later uh earlier she looked confused she turned to ricky bye he said and ushered lucy into the machine the door closed behind them captain memory yawned he was finding this all rather boring wonder what on tv he mused pulling out the tv guide look of concern came over his face ernie noticed this what the matter it the programs the captain said looking distressed they ve um changed changed ernie was uncomprehending changed how well for instance the captain explained instead of love lucy there now wan na donna starring donna the iguana and her husband ricky the reptile in fact captain memory flipped through the pages quickly they all seem to be reptile shows ernie buried his face in his hands oh no now instead of them having to watch our shows we have to watch their shows cm continued calmly perusing the tv guide aside from that they re pretty much the same the plots seem to be about the same he chuckled oh look here the episode where ricky jr hatches sterno seemed lost in thought that reptile lady name was nt really lucy was it he asked the psychiatrist oh no agreed the doctor dat only her stage name sterno eyes narrowed her real name would nt by any chance happen to be he paused for effect donna would it he watched the psychiatrist closely the doctor fidgeted uncomfortably uh um not allowed to divulge personal information about sterno cut him off just as we thought sterno puffed his cigar contemplatively you know some people will do anything to get into show biz the fly antennae waved worriedly do nt know if going to like watching reptile shows all the time the psychiatrist regained his composure vith every successful therapy there is always period of readjustment for ze family in time you vill learn to deal vith dis new situation he turned to captain memory und you must be ze one vis ze amnesia problem the captain looked up who me dat right the psychiatrist looked at him intently you have ze amnesia ja captain memory looked confused not that recall chust as ve thought the doctor said triumphantly scribbling furiously on his notepad all of this was making ernie very uncomfortable hey guys he whispered to the others think maybe we ought to get going what is your problem said sterno loudly um uh everyone was looking at ernie he did nt know what to say the fly looked puzzled is something the matter oh do nt pay any attention to him scoffed sterno gesturing in ernie direction he just paranoid am not said ernie defensively the fly seemed confused paranoids never admit theyre paranoid explained sterno please please gentlemen the psychiatrist broke in ve must return to ze topic everyone vill get his turn to speak he tuned to ernie reassuringly ve must not allow our paranoia to carry us away ja he smiled it seemed to ernie that the smile was nt very friendly but then he thought that what paranoid would think could it be that the doctor was right and that he ernie had become paranoid ernie did nt know what to think any more zo the doctor turned again to captain memory you vere telling us about your computer hacking activities ja was the captain looked puzzled do nt recall that ernie eyes narrowed he did nt recall that either ja ja the psychiatrist said reassuringly amnesia is terrible thing ve must begin your therapy right avay he pulled out gold pocket watch on the end of long chain and began swinging it slowly back and forth in front of captain memory vatch de vatch he whispered to the captain now go back back vhat do you remember captain memory seemed to be completely hypnotized it it so confusing images numbers it space yes cyberspace and it all filled with strange images games pictures old movies and tv shows they re all coming at me all at the same time they re filling my head they re taking over my brain the captain was becoming very agitated relax calm yourself the psychiatrist whispered the captain seemed calmer now go back further back vhat do you see the captain seemed to be in daze pyramids pharaohs no no the psychiatrist protested not that far back knew it ernie broke in ancient egypt please the doctor snapped glaring at ernie do not interrupt your time vill come he smiled evilly or on the other hand perhaps ernie only imagined that he smiled evilly maybe he was really trying to help and ernie paranoia was making him imagine something else ernie just did nt know anymore remember breaking out of an egg the fly was talking now he too seemed to be in daze oh wow thought ernie the fly must have been watching while the doctor hypnotized captain memory now he hypnotized too the psychiatrist glared at the fly quiet please the fly paid no attention he kept on talking larva that it larva the doctor attempted to coax more from captain memory now go back the fly broke in again larva and on nice warm pile of garbage yes the psychiatrist cursed under his breath he turned to the fly wake up he snapped his fingers in front of the fly face both the fly and captain memory awoke instantly the fly put his hands up to his head oh wow he said uncertainly must have dozed off captain memory yawned that funny so did and ve been having the strangest dreams the doctor turned to captain memory with keen interest zo tell me about zese dreams captain memory scratched his head well was in ancient egypt and he trailed off please go on the psychiatrist urged the captain looked confused that all can remember the doctor cursed again he suddenly became aware that ernie was watching him he cleared his throat and regained his composure zo he began now ve give ze other patients turn the doctor turned to one of the patients that had been in the room when the foursome arrived the depressedlooking man who kept wringing his hands why do nt you tell us your name and vhat has brought you to see us today the other patient looked somehow familiar to ernie vell doctor my name is holger horses und mein problem vell it mein job he continued to look steadfastly at the floor never once looking up at the others around him ernie thought it was very odd that this patient too had german accent but then on the other hand perhaps he was just being paranoid the patient went on mein boss he is so demanding if make even one liddle mistake he hits me vith his riding crop und if do nt make any mistake he hits me anyway he sniffled he seemed about to cry it makes me feel so inadequate there there said the doctor commiseratingly handing the man handkerchief the man blew his nose noisily mean it not mein fault dat they keep getting avay ve lock them up good but somehow dey get out and get blamed he sniffled vhy do dey keep doing dis to me all ve vant to do is torture dem liddle oh ja ja the psychiatrist said compassionately ze vorkplace is so demanding dese days understand exactly how you feel do you doctor the man looked up hopefully pleadingly at the psychiatrist does dat mean you vo nt hit me vith the riding crop any more dummkopf the psychiatrist hissed the man caught his breath suddenly and looked quickly back down at the floor he began to moan quietly again the doctor laughed nervously vell uh perhaps ve had best go on to ze next patient he turned to the other man the one who continuously lit matches und your name sir vell herr doktor mein name ist horst manure the man continued to light matches as he talked it seemed very odd to ernie that this patient too spoke with german accent zee said the psychiatrist und vhen did you first notice zis fascination vith fire the patient giggled vell it shtarted vhen rome burned flames everywhere the whole city in flames people running screaming it was chust so much fun he stared fixedly as the match slowly burned down to his fingertips ernie could nt help interrupting wait minute how could you be old enough to be in rome when it burned the patient looked taken aback he looked quickly at the doctor the doctor seemed very uncomfortable uh um ze time machine oh yes he use ze time machine what he doing with time machine anyway ernie demanded the psychiatrist quickly regained his poise he peered at ernie zo do you haff zese attacks of paranoia often ernie was caught off guard um uh yes uh mean no he was becoming very confused the psychiatrist nodded knowingly zee ernie pouted think there something pretty suspicious about this whole business of course you do sterno puffed contentedly on his cigar you re paranoid no ernie began sterno continued cutting ernie off you know ve always suspected as much but now that we have the doctor diagnosis we know for sure something occurred to ernie you suspected as much yes all along sterno maintained smugly well if you re suspecting things than maybe you re the paranoid ernie cried out triumphantly sterno harrumphed do nt think that the fly cut him off oh get it it game right his antennae waved excitedly it find the paranoid right he began bouncing up and down in his seat know know he waved his hands in the air excitedly making incomprehensible gestures first syllable sounds like shtop dis the psychiatrist screamed angrily from out of nowhere riding crop had appeared in his hand he was about to lash out at the patient nearest him when he noticed that everyone was looking at him he stopped and laughed weakly he quickly tossed the riding crop under chair and tried to regain his composure zo uh where vere ve ernie eyes narrowed accusingly you had riding crop the fly bounced up and down excitedly oh wow he had riding crop he not supposed to have that he pointed an accusing finger at the psychiatrist personal foul lose 10 yards do not pass go do not collect 200 he folded his arms triumphantly the doctor smiled weakly uh can explain bid twenty the fly interrupted three strikes and youre out ernie noticed framed diploma hanging on the wall behind him he turned to read it he looked at the diploma and then at the doctor and then at the diploma again hey guys he called out to the others excitedly do you know who this doctor is hes dr heinz von lie enough the psychiatrist slammed riding crop against the seat of an empty chair commanding everyone attention ernie that the first riding crop was still under an empty chair where the doctor had thrown it he appeared to have an endless supply of them all right he took off the thin pincenez glasses he had been wearing tossed them aside and replaced them with monocle zo you haff discovered my true identity eh he laughed evilly ernie was pretty sure that the doctor really was laughing evilly that he was nt just imagining it it does not matter von liederkranz continued the interrogation will proceed the fly was confused interrogation thought it was therapy interrogation therapy what difference does it make the nazi answered it all ze same thing ernie pointed indignantly at sterno see and you thought was paranoid you were wrong was not sterno declared defensively still think you re paranoid but ernie was totally taken aback just because he really nazi does nt mean you re not paranoid sterno continued selfimportantly even paranoids have enemies ernie could only sputter with indignation the fly looked at the nazi accusingly you said you were psychiatrist we trusted you ach but am huh the fly was confused the nazi explained told you am sturmbannfuhrer doktor heinz von liederkranz und vot kind of doctor did you tink vas sterno puffed thoughtfully on his cigar that does make sense he admitted after all if nazi torturer were going to be doctor then psychiatrist would be the one to be precisely von liederkranz agreed the fly antennae waved agitatedly you re not going to torture us are you oh no laughed von liederkranz ve do nt do dat anymore dat barbaric the fly sighed with relief now ve have psychiatry the nazi smiled evilly it much worse ernie began edging slowly towards the door do nt bother the psychiatrist called out it locked ernie lunged for the door anyway noone made move to stop him the door was solid steel and securely locked ernie glumly returned to his seat von liederkranz turned to captain memory the captain hadnt been paying much attention to the proceedings he was still engrossed in the tv guide he appeared to be diligently searching for something to watch other than reptile shows the nazi smiled malevolently zo you did nt like ze hot vhirling corkscrew eh captain memory looked up annoyedly not that again von liederkranz laughed diabolically oh no of course not ve have something heh heh much vorse he peered closely at the captain your mother never liked you he announced captain memory eyes went wide with shock aaugghh he screamed burying his head in his arms the nazi chuckled sadistically told you psychiatry is much vorse und much more effective ernie noticed that the nazi had discarded his cigar and was now holding cigarette in long holder now vill you tell us how you gain access to the system poor captain memory could only whimper von liederkranz did nt seem to mind that the captain refused to talk it gave him more opportunity to practice his sadistic psychiatry very vell he smirked you asked for it he peered intently at the captain choosing his words carefully youre totally inadequate no screamed captain memory curling himself up into tight ball heh heh the nazi chuckled he looked closely at captain memory preparing his next shot you re the captain could nt take any more uh 007c d0 c8 he cried suddenly the scene vanished ernie staggered with vertigo and sat down heavily on the ground his eyes stung as gust of wind blew sand in his face his head swam and he felt nauseous he closed his eyes tightly and put hand over his stomach think getting the flu he moaned after few moments he opened his eyes carefully wiping the sand out of them at first all he could see was sand then he looked up and saw the pyramids ernie breathed in awe chapter 10 ernie looked around the fly was sitting in the sand attempting to make sand castles sterno was prowling around the sand obviously looking for something captain memory was still curled up in ball ernie struggled to his feet and attempted to brush some of the sand off himself he walked over to where the captain lay and tapped him on the shoulder you can come out now he gone captain memory peeked out tentatively he breathed sigh of relief and uncurled sitting up in the sand whew glad that over that was awful the fly peered at captain memory curiously that stuff he was saying was it true mean like about your mother and everything the captain looked puzzled um actually ca nt quite recall but if it had been it would have been pretty awful would nt it wow said the fly in agreement he thought moment and what about that stuff about being totally inad do nt want to talk about it the captain cut him off irritatedly ernie looked up and once again beheld the majesty of the pyramids in the distance they looked lot newer than he remembered them wow he breathed we must be in ancient egypt right captain memory looked perplexed um well could be wrong but think we re on beach in new jersey ah well sterno chimed in still sifting through the sand that explains all these cigarette butts and ringpull tabs ernie stared at him what are you doing seem to have dropped my lighter sterno explained you have nt seen it have you ernie looked around afraid not it so difficult to find anything in this shifting sand sterno stopped and picked up something here penny oh yeah this might be clue to they re location ernie thought what kind is it lincoln sterno turned the penny over no cadillac ernie scratched his head well that close guess whats the date one it sterno examined it closely 2500 bc ernie face lit up oh that explains why the pyramids look new he frowned but what are the pyramids doing on beach in new jersey ve got it sterno cried you do asked ernie in amazement great what he stopped sterno was holding small object triumphantly aloft ive found it he stopped wait minute this is nt my lighter it just an old bic he flicked it small flame appeared oh well he sighed suppose it ll have to do he placed it in his invisible pocket ernie looked at the pyramids again uh anyway as was saying captain memory sighed loudly what the matter the fly wanted to know captain memory shook his head sadly it real bad sign when you get pyramids showing up on beach in new jersey bad sign the fly antennae waved nervously captain memory sighed yeah it means that the fabric of cyberspace is coming apart we re getting really close to that final total sys do nt say it ernie pleaded tem captain memory continued please ernie begged the captain stopped why not ernie moaned it makes my stomach hurt captain memory just shrugged ernie moaned again hey guy the fly chimed in he took small package out of one of his suit pockets and handed it to ernie here what you need have some rolaids oh thanks ernie tried few actually they did seem to help well maybe total system failure was nt that bad after all so what do you wan na do now guys the fly piped up brightly beats me answered captain memory have nt the foggiest replied sterno absently he was engrossed in trying to light cigar using the tiny flame from the old bic ernie looked around dunno what do you wan na do wan na go see an ancient undiscovered tomb that sounds like fun huh the fly antennae waved expectantly oh let answered sterno brightly he was in much better mood now that he gotten his cigar going ernie frowned how do you know where to find an ancient undiscovered tomb simple the fly replied cheerfully just follow the signs he pointed to an object in the distance ernie peered in the direction the fly was pointing sure enough he could just barely make out sign which said this way to the ancient undiscovered tomb with an arrow pointing the way well ernie was nt sure this was going to be such good idea aw come on guys the fly enthused it ll be fun well ernie was unconvinced do you have something better to do sterno demanded well ernie hesitated that settled then sterno stated with finality he glared at ernie and do wish you would nt keep repeating yourself all the time well ernie began please sterno cut him off ernie decided to just be quiet the foursome trudged through the dry sand luckily the sun though bright was not very hot ernie hoped they did nt have far to go trying to walk through the shifting blowing sand was very tiring the approached the sign the sign seemed to be pointing to something behind one of the pyramids as they rounded the corner they became able to see what it was wow breathed ernie in awe fabulous egyptian temple stood in front of them crumbling columns towered 200 feet into the sky supporting sandstone roof that had collapsed at various points in the center of the temple stood large stone structure with no windows and only one door which was closed after few moments ernie noticed that there was small brightlycolored wooden building standing in front of the temple sign on the little building said see the ancient undiscovered tomb admission 200 inside the small building was portly middleaged man wearing bright plaid suit and straw hat and smoking cigar step right up gentlemen he cried to them yer just in time oh wow said the fly obviously excited we wan na see the tomb of course you do sonny said the man flicking the ash of his cigar everybody wants to see the tomb let see theres four at two dollars each he looked the group over ll tell you what gon na do because like yer uh he looked at the fly with puzzlement face gon na give you special price only 10 for all of ya gee thanks said the fly enthusiastically ernie opened his mouth to speak hey that okay guys the fly cut him off it on me he handed the ticketseller 10 bill step right on in gentlemen the ticketseller gestured towards the door of the tomb as they approached ernie examined the hieroglyphics on the walls of the temple suddenly one caught his eye look he pointed it out it the rca dog and the phonograph this must be oh your not going to start that dead sea phonograph records business again are you sterno said irritatedly well ernie began will you please stop saying that sterno cried in exasperation ernie shut up the interior of the building did in fact look like an ancient undiscovered tomb mummy cases lined the walls strange carved containers some shaped like animals lay on all sides drifting sand lay piled up against everything wow the fly was amazed an ancient undiscovered tomb bet we re the first people to be in here in zillion years an ancient wooden cabinet caught ernie attention the figure of the rca dog was carved into it ernie opened it gingerly aha he cried look inside sure enough was an ancient acoustic victrolatype record player lined up neatly in slots were dozens of flat black disks that could only be 78 rpm records see proclaimed ernie told you so it the dead sea phonograph records cool enthused the fly play it ernie was taken aback this could be the greatest find of all time it could change the world completely alter life as we know it he had to be very careful one mistake might ruin the whole thing if he made the wrong move the greatest discovery in history might be lost forever and it would be all his fault um play it ernie hesitated uncomfortably um not sure play it demanded sterno irritably you ve been going on and on about this for for sterno thought moment actually for billions of years now and we re all just about sick of it all right here it is now play it already ernie looked over the machine warily um not exactly sure how to work it he tugged at one of the 78 rpm records it refused to come out of it slot sterno sighed in exasperation it simple enough look he pointed to corroded metal strip on the bottom part of the machine there were number of buttons on it and slot next to the slot ernie could just barely make out the words insert coin ernie searched through his pockets um oh all right sterno snapped annoyedly here he handed ernie the cadillac penny um thanks ernie dropped the coin into the slot for moment nothing happened then slowly the ancient machine began to creak into action small dim light appeared behind little square next to the slot brushing away the dust ernie could just barely make out the words make selection oh wow said ernie next to each button was small rectangle which was obviously supposed to contain the name of the song unfortunately most of them were so covered by dirt and corrosion that ernie could nt read them um which one should pick he asked in confusion who cares barked sterno in exasperation just pick something ernie peered at the selections he was desperately afraid of making the wrong choice this might be his only chance to learn the secret of the universe or something like that he had to make the right selection suddenly he saw something he recognized hey look at this he pointed at one of the selections it sam the sham and the pharaohs see told you play it cried the fly enthusiastically play it snapped sterno annoyedly but but ernie peered at it more closely the song is walk like man do nt think sam the sham ever did that song play it shrieked sterno his patience gone ernie frowned he looked at captain memory the captain just shrugged well ernie said hesitantly okay he pushed the button the ancient machine slowly creaked into action 78 rpm record dropped on to the platter and the device began to play within the first few notes ernie knew something had gone terribly wrong the music was growing louder with every second much louder than an old victrola could ever have made it in fact painfully loud this is nt walk like man ernie cried terrible realization hit him if you took walk like man and crossed it with sam the sham and the pharaohs you get suddenly it was all too clear he recognized the music plainly now oh no ernie wailed it walk like an egyptian what yelled captain memory the music was too loud drowning out their words he looked at the others he could see their mouths moving but he could nt hear word they were saying the music was too loud drowning out everything the music grew louder with every passing second the pain began to build in ernie head he tried to cover his ears with his hands but found it very difficult to do while holding the coffee maker it did nt help anyway the music was so loud that it vibrated through his hand through his head the whole temple was vibrating ernie looked at captain memory do something he shouted the captain shrugged and pointed to his ears obviously meaning ca nt hear word you re saying ernie looked at sterno and the fly they had their hands over their ears their eyes clenched tight in pain sterno especially seemed to be suffering his keen dog hearing more affected by the sound than the others ernie was miserable not only was he in pain from the terribly loud music but his very best idea ever to go find the dead sea phonograph records had turned into disaster the music grew ever louder ernie knew that excessive sound levels can be fatal they were all going to be killed by walk like an egyptian played at million decibels and he did nt even like that song ernie tried to hold his hands more tightly over his ears if only the coffee maker was nt in his way suddenly it hit him the coffee maker he set the selector to destroy aimed it at the ancient victrola and flipped the strength lever to full suddenly the victrola vanished along with the cabinet the wall of the tomb half the temple and just about everything else ernie could see in fact ernie now seemed to be standing at the edge of huge chasm it was so broad that ernie could nt see the other side so deep that he could nt see the bottom ernie felt tap on his shoulder he turned the fly was pointing at the opposite wall of the tomb and saying something but ernie could nt make out what although the music had stopped when the victrola was destroyed ernie ears were still ringing so badly that he could nt hear thing looking at the wall ernie guessed what the problem was without the other side of the tomb to hold it up the huge stone wall was swaying it looked as though it might crush them at any moment without thinking ernie aimed the coffee maker at the wall and flipped on the power switch this time his ears were just barely recovered enough to hear the tremendous roar as the psion megaforce generator destroyed the other wall and everything else for as far as the eye could see as the dust cleared ernie could see that where the opposite wall had been there was now what seemed to be bottomless measureless chasm on that side too there was steep drop as though they were standing on the edge of an infinitely tall cliff all that remained was the 8foot by 10 foot patch of sand and rock which had been the inside of the tomb where they now stood looking around all that ernie could see was the little piece of land that they were now standing on and the sky everything else appeared to have been disintegrated as the ringing in ernie ears slowly subsided he began to hear captain memory saying something wow the captain was peeking over the edge of the precipice that psion megaforce generator sure is powerful ernie carefully peered over the brink he tried to see the bottom of the crater but he could nt see thing no wait minute he did see something he saw stars how could there be stars at the bottom of hole the fly peeked over the edge as well whew that some big hole you blew there buddy ernie continued to peer into the hole trying to make some sense out of what he saw he turned to captain memory um how far down does that hole go anyway the captain shook his head sadly all the way huh ernie was uncomprehending all the way to where china captain memory continued to peer downward further than that from the look of it say just about all the way to mars the captain shook his head sadly you know you really should read the directions to those things before you use them ernie looked at the coffee maker in dismay he placed the it carefully in the sand and gingerly edged away from it hey this is really cool the fly continued to look over the rim can see stars looking down he looked up and looking up he peered over the opposite edge hey there stars on all sides neat how did you do that sterno stared at ernie his eyes widening in horror you did nt captain memory shook his head sorrowfully he did what demanded ernie what did do sterno seemed to be in state of shock you mean that one little device could captain memory nodded dismally afraid so what ernie was becoming very agitated sterno glared balefully at ernie how could you do such thing will somebody please tell me what did ernie wailed captain memory sighed well let me put it to you this way you see this little patch of ground we re standing on that all that left all that left of what ernie was nt following this at all of the planet earth the captain declared morosely what ernie was horrified captain memory shook his head dejectedly afraid you blew just about the entire planet away everything except the little patch we re standing on he peeked over the edge looks like you nailed the moon too but but ernie protested weakly how could that happen the captain sighed told you that thing was powerful he continued peering over the edge something caught his eye he brightened ah good that relief what ernie was desperate for any good news captain memory smiled you ll be glad to know that mars is fine the blast did nt even touch it he peered more closely it might be little off it orbit but aside from that its perfectly okay ernie moaned suddenly captain memory straightened up he began looking in all directions look of consternation on his face somethings happening sterno glared at ernie this is all your fault the fly put his hands up to his head oh wow my head it what happening to me ernie jaw dropped in amazement the fly head was beginning to change as the others watched in astonishment the fly head shimmered disappeared and was replaced by the perfectly normal looking head of man in his mid 30 whoo complained the fly feel really weird he squinted there something wrong with my eyes ca nt see too good anymore you re you re normal ernie gasped in astonishment the fly put his hands up to his head feeling out it shape oh wow it my old head got it back ernie turned to captain memory is helpless astonishment what happening captain memory too looked amazed it the game weve ended the game of course sterno caught his drift immediately by destroying most of the world you ve brought the game to an end there not enough of the planet left to play with right captain memory beamed and you ve done it within the logical confines of the program using materials found within the program in manner consistent with the program logic captain memory reached out to shake ernie hand good job sterno looked ruefully over the edge of the chasm of course do nt think we got very many points it does nt matter said captain memory cheerfully its game over that all we need ernie was finding this all difficult to follow so now what now the system shuts down in an orderly manner and were all free cried the captain jubilantly the evil genius waldo stadium is thwarted his cyberslaves are set free we win ernie eyes narrowed you talk about all of this almost as if it was game captain memory seemed taken aback did he said innocently well sure did nt mean to he trailed off meanwhile the fly was engrossed in examining his head he had pulled out small pocket mirror and was looking himself over carefully hey this is great he enthused ve got my looks back the babes are gon na love it awright it time to paaa rty ernie looked around thoughtfully there was nt much to see all that was left of the planet earth was the little patch of ground that they stood on what what going to happen to us now well captain memory scratched his head guess well all be going home sterno put paw over his stomach feel very strange he complained suddenly sterno shimmered and disappeared ernie was aghast oh my god he gone what happened to him it beginning captain memory replied calmly we re all going back to our proper place and time the captain hesitated wherever that is we re going back the fly was enthusiastic awright he too had begun to shimmer he flashed ernie the thumbs up sign it party time with that he was gone now there was only ernie and captain memory but but what should do when get back ernie wanted to know mean after all this should nt dunno do something captain memory shrugged guess you ll just have to wait and see suddenly ernie felt ill the world began to shimmer around him the captain shape was becoming vague and indistinct the last thing ernie saw was the captain gazing ruefully at his bare wrist sure wish could have gotten watch though he said sadly with that the scene vanished epilogue ernie head swan the strange distorted shapes of surreal landscape swirled around him he stumbled backwards and his hand fell upon doorknob reflexively he pulled it open and stepped through bright fluorescent light dazzled his eyes he became aware of the sound of many voices in the distance he staggered forward all done girl voice startled ernie he looked up he was back at the arcade did you have nice game the girl at the information booth was asking him twirling finger through her hair absentmindedly uh ernie could only mumble however did you get that loincloth so dirty she reproved cracking her chewing gum loudly there five dollar cleaning fee for that you know ernie mind was slowly clearing uh yeah he managed to answer you can change in there the girl pointed to dressing room when you return the loincloth and the broadsword you ll get your deposit back she looked at him pointedly minus the five dollar cleaning fee as ernie changed his mind began to clear putting his own clothes on again made him feel almost normal had all of this really happened or had it all been just an illusion maybe it was all just malfunctioning computer program ernie could nt be sure ernie walked slowly home from the arcade trying to put his mind in order he looked carefully at everything he passed for some reason it seemed to him that things would be somehow different yet the neighborhood looked about the same as far as he could tell but then again he never really paid that much attention to all the details some of them might be different and he never even notice after what seemed very long time he approached his own house he examined it carefully it looked the same as far as he could tell he took deep breath and went inside hello dear he heard his mother voice come from the kitchen did you have nice game uh guess he called out in reply it was uh different that nice his mother answered dinner ready ernie walked into the dining room he was still feeling pretty woozy maybe something to eat would make him feel better ernie mother entered carrying large covered dish ernie gasped mom your hair ernie mother looked confused what about my hair it it green ernie choked but it always been green his mother was puzzled are you feeling all right dear boy ernie collapsed into chair no he moaned do nt feel good at all it must be that awful virtual reality game his mother said knowingly ve always said those things were unhealthy it just too much stimulation for young minds uh yeah ernie agreed pitifully have some dinner and you ll feel better she said wisely dishing out plate of food for ernie ve made your favorite squid with mothballs uh ernie began your favorite tv show on tonight his mother continued cheerily wan na donna with donna the iguana in fact she went on brightly all your favorite reptiles are on tonight ernie sighed deeply well he thought it looks like home sort of the end
