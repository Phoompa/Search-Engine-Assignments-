length 18912 words subject the hell machine posted 27 jan 90 073248 gmt 1985 james charles lynn the hell machine by james lynn gggrrrrrrrrrriiiiinnnnnddd being friday the traffic on the 205 bridge was fairly heavy roy karsten was heading across for portland in his little fourbanger datsun pickup it was warm halfcloudy september afternoon and he might have actually enjoyed the ride except for two little problems one was the leather briefcase that sat on the seat beside him the other kaarrruunnnnkkk was the fact that he could nt get the truck into fourth gear he had the clutch jammed to the floor but every time he tried to slip the gearshift into the notch it adamantly refused to cooperate and instead responded with clashing of teeth deep in the kaarrruunnnnkkk grrriiinnnddd transmission that set his own teeth on edge the speedometer was down to 45 now and slowly dropping this was the last thing he needed now earlier he had called the group at the research center with his findings after lot of arguing he managed to get frank to hold the experiment at least until he could get there and show them the figures on paper he was convinced he was right if the genesis machine worked they could all be in serious trouble roy suspected his calculations showed only fraction of the machine true potential wham wham the truck shook every time the gears clashed roy had sneaking hunch that the transmission and probably the whole truck was nearing the end of its useful life the transmission had been giving him problems lately but nothing like this he did nt have the foggiest what was wrong he was mathmetician not mechanic the needle quivered just below forty at the rate he was going he would nt even make it halfway across the bridge roy slammed his foot on the clutch hard put both hands on the gearshift knob gritted his teeth and jerked the lever into the notch as hard as he could gggggggrrrrrrrr kawhaaammm the tiny truck shuddered like bomb had gone off in the bed but the lever finally slipped into the fourth gear slot in fact roy discovered it now went into all the slots easily even after he let up on the clutch when he pressed the accelerator the engine raced freely uhoh the needle now eased down past thirty some creep in rx7 shot around him at seventy blasting on the horn after wearing out every carnal verb in his vocabulary roy decided he better get this heap into the breakdown lane before it stopped completely fortunately he was facing downhill and had enough momentum to ease it all the way over to the right he heard gravel crunch under his tires as he pulled over and it finally occurred to him that he should turn on the fourway flashers since he had no parking brake he grabbed the knob and put it it in reverse so it would nt roll downhill he stared in astonishment as the lever came loose in his hand smoke drifted up from the hole in the transmission hump the truck was still slowly moving so he had only one choice he eased the wheel slightly to the right gritting his teeth as first the right fender then the whole side of the truck ground against the concrete barrier he was ready to jump out if the barrier showed any sign of breaking but finally the truck stopped he got out and slammed the door still holding the gearshift lever cars were zooming by uncomfortably close in the next lane still cursing blue streak roy stomped around to the front of the truck and kicked it hard enough to break the plastic grille jesus what else could go wrong he noticed the lever in his hand for the first time and flung it out over the barrier it flew in long graceful curve catching splinters of sunlight before splashing in the water one hundred thirty feet below enough temper tantrums he told himself first priority was getting those papers to the lab pressing up against the body of the truck to present as small target as possible to oncoming traffic he edged his way back to the cab he retrieved his case through the open window and made his way forward again he put his thumb out and began walking down the road more than little concious of the barrier beside him not even waist high it was the only thing protecting him from thirteen story drop forty minutes later he was still walking nobody had even slowed down most of the cars had oregon plates which explained lot oregon drivers were the most inconsiderate in the entire country at least frank was holding the experiment or so he hoped if they fired that thing up he caught movement out of the corner of one eye there was something happening in the east they had nt waited there was no logical basis for this assumption but he knew it to be true all the same it was the only explanation for what he was watching the briefcase fell from nerveless fingers certain wellknown landmark in the east had just dissappeared in its place was huge greyblack dome rising for the sky the very clouds were being pulled in towards it he did nt know exactly what had happened but he could make darn good guess the entire tableau was taking place in hellish silence but he would hear it soon enough it about three and half minutes if he guaged the distance correctly traffic was still speeding by but few vehicles were slowing down as they noticed what was happening he knew he was in mortal danger but there was nowhere to run nowhere to hide he should have stayed with the truck besides he was nt nearly as concerned for his own safety as he was for the safety of the world not quite meanwhile he was supposed to be here half an hour ago frank lindstrom paced restlessly around the basement lab of the mechtronix inc portland annex he could nt pace far as the room was all but packed with sophisticated equipment he managed circle maybe five feet in diameter it distracted the others you know roy replied jean lambert she was sitting at franks monitoring station trying to make sense of the screens physicist she was nt responsibility is not his forte tell me about it frank sighed but he sounded so worried he made me promise to postpone until he got here norbert howell looked up from the xmen comic he had been reading at his station well we ca nt postpone much longer the capaciters wo nt hold this big charge very long without burning up something expensive if we dont start in the next few minutes ll have to shut down it ll take at least week to clean up and restart the reactor damn frank muttered jean got up and went down to the lower level where the fourth member of the team was sitting douglas how are you feeling douglas everett looked up from the photograph he was holding ookay guess im still ready to try if you are good she was worried about doug he was emotionally unstable and lightly retarded he had been married until about year ago and then his wife alice had left him for another man the shock put him in an institution from which he had only been recently released alice had contacted him not long after about the possiblity of reconciliation doug had been overjoyed alice was the only light in an otherwise dismal life then about two days ago he recieved news that she had been killed in skiing accident on mt hood he did not lose his grip on reality again as everybody feared he might but something in him had definitely changed there were those who thought it might have been better if he had lost it again frank sat down in his chair and scanned the readouts everything peaked for the conditions it ll take us more like month to recalibrate he looked around at them if roy not going to show then ca nt take his warning very seriously he is prone to exaggeration say we go ahead any objections there were none stations then frank said he started the videotapes norbert stashed his comic and began tuning the reactor controls doug pocketed the photograph and sat back as jean placed the electroencephelagraphic helmet on his head the entire experiment hinged on doug he had been long ago tested and found to have very strong psionic abilities he could nt conciously read minds or bend spoons but the potential was there that potential was what made it possible for the helmet to read images from his brain those images were comverted to computer impulses and fed into the heart of the experiment the genesis machine the genesis machine was small cube about two inches on side norbert with his comicbook humor had dubbed it the cosmic cube it was mirroredsilver and consisted of nonconducting alloy formed around highly complex circuitry it hung suspended behind thick glass at one end of the room with wires attached to each of its six sides the processes in the genesis machine were far too complicated to explain but its theoretical purpose was to convert energy to matter norbert fusion plasma reactor would supply energy in abundance and the images from doug brain far more detailed that anything computer could generate would provide pattern for the forming matter assuming the whole thing worked which was iffy frank controlled the link from his console jean task was to coach doug and watch his condition norbert called out output seven point three two five gigavolts reactor at optimum frank answered all components read good temp on capaciter bank four is little high told ya jean frank called down jean looked at doug now remember just like we practiced visualise the cylinder concentrate on its every aspect concentrate ve got it frank watched as computer enhanced image of cylinder appeared on his screen he made some last minute adjustments all readings within safe limits voltages consistant feed noise point oh oh oh four looks good folks excitement surged though him the greatest scientists in the world had nt even dreamed of something like this platform rested at the opposite end of the room from the cube hidden behind lead shielding it was where the object was supposed to materialise frank said vector coordinates and read out series of numbers norbert read list of numbers off an auxiliary screen and concurred frank transmitted the numbers to the cube in essence telling it to focus its power on the platform jean watched doug vital signs on monitor they showed he was as excited as the rest of them completely professional now she coached doug verbally while continuously taking readings on his brainwaves the peaks and valleys were greatly exaggerated which was normal for him jean said nothing to them which frank took as an all clear he flipped final switch now doug was linked via computor directly to the cube the genesis machine was ready all it needed now was power the cube is primed frank said it all yours norbert voltage seven point four oh five transmitting now norbert snapped single large black switch feeding the full output of the reactor enough power to incinerate small town to the genesis machine for exactly one second the cube shone like miniature sun and then all hell broke loose frank slowly picked himself up off the floor battery powered backup lights were beginning to flicker on the air was filled with the sharp stink of ozone and melted plastic and metal though his voice made his head hurt even worse he yelled out hey somebody speak to me is everyone all right norbert groaned not me feels like they nuked my cerebellum you and me both jean doug say something he called down into the semidarkness something doug called back giggling little we re all right jean said slowly she shook her head trying to clear it the fog was slowly lifting if knew what one felt like could say whether or not we just experienced psychic feedback it was trip can say that norbert commented still little groggy he looked over his instruments crap everything burned out got no power anywhere could have told you that just from smelling the air frank replied he tried the backups but they were dead too so was the ventilation jean since you re next to the door would you care to prop it open so we dont suffocate by the way what psychic feedback never heard of it norbert suddenly gasped holy sh look and pointed to the back of the lab the materialization platform was hidden from direct view by the lead shielding but the fading glow being reflected off the walls and ceiling behind it told them something was happening cautiously the four got up and approached it doug kept to the back knowing smile on his face stay here frank said as he went around the shield he appeared second later holding large object in his hands it was statue of nude woman about three feet high and formed in such perfect detail that it could not have been made by human hands the most amazing thing about it was that it appeared to be made of solid gold jean saw from the way frank muscles were standing out that it must have been heavy she hoped he did nt hurt himself frank set it down on its base with grunt got into this field to get away from hard work could that be real gold thought we were trying for cylinder jean said sorry doug said his eyes were fixed on the statue he went over to admire it closer he ran his hands over its smooth curves it beautiful is nt it yes it is frank assured him jesus solid gold how the hell did we do that it must be worth fortune yeah norbert said probably about onefifth the cost of the equipment we blew up not very profitable scheme sides considering all the variables that we could nt control more likely it an alloy that looks and weighs close to gold he leaned closer for better look the details fantastic though you can even see the hairs on her norbert jean said warningly oh uh sorry he blushed bright red and busied himself checking damage anyway frank said we ll have to get sample upstairs to the metallurgy boys for analysis and identification then we ll know for sure we can probably take some off the base no doug screamed he threw his arms around the statue protectively do nt damage it you ca nt he looked pleadingly at jean miss lambert please do nt let them hurt it please startled by the vehemence of doug reaction jean hastily reassured him do nt worry douglas wo nt let them calm down frank looked at her in disbelief and she took his arm and led him to the back of the room speaking softly so doug could nt hear her she said tell me does nt that statue look familiar frank replied well ca nt say recognize the body but think know the face that his exwife is nt it exactly it obvously an idealized image of her and he ca nt bear the thought of it being damaged think we should humor him on this at least until later there no rush maybe can convince him to suddenly the lab door slammed open standing there panting was dudley wilson one of the computer nerds from upstairs he was frantic about something out there the mountain he puffed incoherently norbert grabbed him by the shoulders and said calm down guy calm down what about what mountain dudley regained his composure little itsit gone mount hood just vanished into thin air they gaped at each other for long comical second then scrambled for the stairway poor dudley almost got trampled in the process by mutual unspoken consent they all ran for the commissary the commissary was on the east side of the building and one entire wall consisted of fifteen by forty foot multipaned window overlooking scenic mt hood they crowded in through the door and dudley came in last and pushed through them hopping up and down he pointed out the window there you see you see but nobody had reply for him where mt hood once stood huge greyblack mushroom cloud now rose towards the sky like mighty fist the cumulus above was being sucked towards it it was like st helens again but the mountain was nt erupting it was simply gone norbert voiced the first thought that came to all their minds nukes no frank said shakily that not fireball that cloud from from suddenly his eyes widened in horror oh my god there were about fifteen people in the commissary at the moment they all had their noses plastered to the glass trying to see better get away from that window frank roared at them get some cover now it was the panic in frank voice that did the trick the people began backing away from the window not understanding why frank grabbed jean and hustled back out into the hall norbert doug and dudley followed also confused jean began to protest at this manhanding but her words were suddenly lost in the rising howl from outside the howl rose to scream of hurricane force winds and they all suddenly felt as if icepicks were being jabbed in their ears the pain increased tenfold and there was loud boom as every window in the building exploded outward from the pressure difference then the hurricane was inside sucking up papers books chairs anything small that was nt nailed down accompanying this chaos was loud basso rumbling that first rattled their ears then shook the whole building the hallway was fairly well protected from all of this but it was still like standing in wind tunnel jean buried her face in frank chest and clutched him desperately as if to keep from blowing away although it was hardly that bad dudley scared out of his wits had similar grip on norbert and was in serious danger of strangling him doug simply put his hands over his face and collapsed against the wall sobbing slowly the wind and rumbling died down leaving everybody feeling as if their ears were stuffed full of cotton norbert finally untangled himself from dudley with curse dudley bereft of his support ran down the hall screaming hysterically jean held on to frank for long time before letting go norbert yelled you knew that was going to happen an implosion frank replied the mountain dissappeared and left vacuum air rushed in to fill it sucking up all kinds of dirt and debris and crap that what the cloud was soon as realized that knew there was going to be shockwave something tickled his nose he rubbed it and his hand came away covered in blood norbert had nosebleed too they went back into the commissary there was huge hole in the wall where the window used to be the mushroom cloud had become haze that covered most of the horizon tables chairs food and trays were strewn all over the room people began to pick themselves up painfully nobody seemed seriously hurt norbert was mumbling something they could nt hear what jean asked he turned to them with haunted eyes it could nt be coincidence the mountain vanished at the exact same time the experiment blew up what are you talking about norbert pointed out the window shakily we did that frank and jean sat huddled together silently on the bottom step of the stairway in the lab still trying to accept what they saw the process was constantly interrupted by noises from the upper level finally there was grunt and loud crash followed by curse of appropriate foulness annoyed frank called up what the hell are you doing norbert appeared at the top of the stair sucking his hand dismantling the experiment why you have got to be kidding he replied aghast if somebody else got ahold of this thing dammit norbert frank snarled we have no proof that that mess is our fault or the experiment caused it just lay off norbert came down and sat beside him he placed hand on frank shoulder and said quietly do you really believe that or are you just afraid im right he turned and glared norbert norbert suddenly felt little afraid after all frank was about twice his size and in very unstable mood at the moment as well but this was important he had to make him see just think for minute reach down deep inside and tell me what you feel what think we all feel frank was still for long moment when he turned to norbert his eyes were full of fear did feel it right when it happened my first view of that cloud out there gave me feeling of deja vu but that impossible you ca nt know something before you find out about it mountains do nt vanish into thin air too my god he whispered what have we done jean finaly spoke up having heard enough you re both crazy expect that sort of thing from you and your comicbook mentality norbert but you should know better frank she got up and backed away from them like they were mad thousands must have died from that and you re saying we killed them will not take responsibility for that frank got up and went to her but she kept backing out of his reach do nt you realize what you re saying we disintegrated mountain whole mountain that kind of power lies only in the hands of god himself all those people with muffled sob she bolted through the door frank stood there staring out the door norbert finally spoke she feels it too it was like telepathic link between the four of us and the machine we knew what it had done only we re just now realizing it think that scares her more than anything else you better go to her frank glared at him you re the one who stirred her up this is rotten time to go around spouting lot of psuedoscientific bullshit and dont need you to tell me what to do norbert watched him stomp out the door angrily he was just edgy they were all edgy they had created device of unbelievable destructive power perhaps infinite only madman would nt be bothered by that norbert was amazed at how easily he accepted the whole situation the others would come around in time his thoughts were interrupted by loud snap from the front of the lab doug had finally managed to pull the cube from its mount which he had been trying to do all this time he brought it over to norbert and asked in childish almost pleading voice mine norbert looked at the cube it appeared unharmed but the power surge had surely fried the imbedded circuits it was nothing more than paperweight now handing it back he said sure why not doug face lit up and he handled the cube like it might break at ny second norbert envied him his ignorance of the situation the guy might have only half brain but at times like this it was an advantage he did nt have to deal with it at all not that he really had anything to do with it anyway he was just volunteer blameless but one thing kept sticking in his mind like jean said power like that only rested in god hands until now jean sat up slowly blinking the sleep out of her eyes the clock read 751 she clicked off the alarm quietly she got out of the bed trying to disturb frank sleep as little as possible disdaining robe she padded out into the front room naked she opened the curtain on the big floortoceiling picture window letting the sun flood the room she gazed out over the magnificent view of portland from his home high up rocky butte the sun hung over the west hills she stood there for long moment letting the warming rays bathe over her body the window was made of oneway glass so she was nt giving anybody free show still the feeling of exhibitionism was delicious maybe little tittilating made all the more so by the fact that nobody could really see her something was bothering her but she could nt put finger on it things had pretty much settled in the month since mt hood had dissappeared the estimated death toll had been around twelve thousand and everybody was thankful it had nt been much higher one death though had hit very close to home the police had found roy truck on the 205 bridge with wrecked transmission coast guard boats had found him floating face down several miles downriver apparently he had been walking when the shockwave from the mountain dissappearance had blown him off the bridge like bug jean felt little tug in her throat when she thought of it despite his irresponsibility they had all liked him except for frank she did nt see too much of the others these days norbert was working on some kind of new power source that nasa had contracted mechtronix to develop for their proposed space station doug was back at his job washing dishes for diner somewhere on sandy blvd frank was working on design for new highspeed cpu that could give microcomputer speed to rival cray if it worked out he could kiss off mechtronix and their slave wages and open his own business hell in year he could probably buy them out jean herself had been offered teaching position at psu and she was considering taking it somehow the thought of staying around mech seemed unbearable she had been spending more nights here than at her own home lately not surprising since the mt hood incident she had definite aversion to being alone alone the ghosts of the dead would haunt her sleep frank understood this feeling very well and offered to put her up in his guest room she had nt intended to wind up in his bed but somehow she had anyway he was strong sensitive intelligent fun to be around she could nt name all of it but she had been attracted to him almost from the beginning not to mention he was great lay she smiled cotentedly at the memory of the previous night but ghosts haunted his sleep too ghosts of different kind she thought at night she would sometimes be awakened by his thrashing and moaning what little she could make out of his words had something to do with guns and men in ski masks in the daytime he would pass it off as just nightmare and say nothing more but high on his left bicep was scar from bullet graze she dropped the subject hoping eventually he would relent and talk about it whatever it was it must have been terrible and the worst scars were where nobody could see them she stretched her arms over her head groaning luxuriously the sun felt wonderful something was still bothering her though how could anything be wrong on beautiful morning like this the birds were singing outside there was nt cloud in the sky and the sun hung like spotlight in the west west she glanced sharply over at the wall clock little after eight and the sun was just little over the west hills it was unreal but so natural that she froze for second her heart pounding rapidly finally the spell broke and she ran to the bedroom screaming for frank nobody else found anything strange about western sunrise or at least that was the impression the news gave they flipped through all the channels back and forth for two hours finally settling on cnn headline news they had features on war murder political corruption halley comet but nothing about the sunrise it was as if things had always been this way an oppressive feeling of unreality settled down over the both of them maybe they were going crazy there was knock at the door frank went over to answer it it was norbert hi he peeked around frank hi jean he opened his mouth to say something else and the stopped with puzzled look on his face what is this nudist convention they both looked down at themselves and remembered that neither had thought to throw anything on in the excitement jean yelped and ducked into the bedroom frank followed her close behind so to speak he was more uncomfortable than she was because he knew that norbert was acdc from the front door norbert called out loudly glad to hear it ai nt ve had my fill of strangeness for one day and it not even lunch yet jean came out tying the sash on her robe you noticed it too the sunrise mean yep norbert replied me and no one else took me an hour before thought to ask you people frank came out fully dressed and wearing jacket he ignored the strange look jean gave him we re in big trouble you know the whole world is tell me about it thought it began and ended with mt hood now dont know what to think jean looked at them both confused what are you talking about norbert turned to her from the facts can only extrapolate that we have undermined the fabric of reality with our little experiment ve been watching carefully and there been some subtle changes around here along with the obvious ones and they re multiplying at an unpredictable rate we ve screwed up the universe and there you have it the final signing of the mutual nonagression pact by the united states and the soviet union plans call for the immediate verifiable disarmament of the nuclear arsenals of both cities within the next six months optimism runs high in both washington and moscow that total disarmament will be completed ahead of schedule click total withdrawal of all soviet troops from east germany and czechoslovakia completes the first phase of the ussr plan to return all its satellite countries to their original status as independant states millions of dollars of aid are being sent to all former communist dominated countries click the economy has improved to the point where there are actually more jobs than people currently able to work in the us click p147 has been approved by the fda for testing in several hospitals around the country researchers are ethiusiastic that p147 will prove to the the longsought panacea capable of curing all known diseases without side effects frank threw the remote control down on the couch jean picked it up and continued flipping through the channels stopping on every chanel that showed the news in one form or other hell the news was more interesting than anything else on tv things were getting out of control the world had changed almost beyond recognition in the three weeks since jean first saw the sun rise in the west war poverty hunger disease were all but nonexistant by now earth was well on its way to becoming true utopia which was fine except would it stop there and frank was slowly becoming convinced of one thing these changes were not as random as they first seemed somebody was controlling them but who he sat back down and rubbed his eyes tiredly god if only he could wake up the whole world was being pulled out from under him like rug and as far as he could tell only himself norbert and jean realized that anything was amiss every one else accepted the changes that faced them every morning when they woke up as if things had ben that way all their lives he put an arm around jean protectively his worst nightmare was that he would wake up one morning and find that she was gone indeed had never existed anywhere but in his mind as consequencem frank slept even less well than usual these nights jean had stoped on another channel showing the news something in the broadcast dragged frank from his dark contemplations the madman known to the public only as nom de guerre was shot to death today in an attack on novelist silverman de guerre has attempted to kill mr silverman three times in the past five years de guerre reportedly stepped out of an alleyway and fired single 45 caliber slug which struck silverman directly in the skull but miraculously ricocheted off silverman drew concealed 38 derringer and shot de guerre twice in the chest killing him instantly silverman was reported in satisfactory condition at dammisch hospital at the hospital he stated quote people always said was hardheaded end quote police are withholding de guerre true identity pending notification of his family jean grunted too bad wish de guerre had nailed that jerk his novels are the most pretentious obnoxious crap have ever frank tuned her out thinking he loved her dearly but admittedly her taste in literature was atrocious but who did he know that was silverman fan most people he knew either did nt care how the de guerresilverman conflict twelveyear war first verbal then physical and not all of the attacks had come from mr de guerre or actively rooted for de guerre silverman was thirdrate hack novelist whose only real claim to fame was highly publicised and probably staged feud with an anonymous madman but someone he knew was complete silverman fanatic raving for days on end whenever silverman produced another novel probably the person who was pulling the strings of creation was silverman fan it was the only explanation for his miraculous survival but who someone he had seen recently he was sure and someone connected with the experiment oh no cold chill of realization ran through his guts it all made sense the one man they had nt heard from the man on whom the whole experiment had hinged somehow he had mannaged to gain control of some horrible power and was now using it to shape the world in his image his face pastewhite he turned to jean and shakily began honey think know there was sudden panicked hammering at the door shocked they both froze and stared for long moment frank finally got up and opened the door norbert stumbled in headfirst he grabbed frank by the shirt and tried to gasp something out frank could se in his eyes that this was man pushed almost to the edge of sanity by something he grabbed norbert shoulders and shook him get ahold of yourself man what the matter norbert tried once more to speak but only faint wheeze came out finally all the panic drained out of him at once as he collapsed in franks arms in dead faint with shaky hand norbert lifted the glass to his lips the booze slipped down his throat and burned queasily in his stomach for moment he felt as though the stuff might make return appearance but finally his insides quit churning and he felt himself begin to relax still shivering he pulled the blanket tighter around him frank and jean were watching him anxiously but they would not press for information considering his current emotional state that might not be wise when he spoke his voice was almost whisper gave it to him just gave it to him did nt know the power of that thing he lapsed into silence staring into infinity christ jean thought he slipping in and out of shock what happened after long moment his eyes refocused and he seemed to become aware of the real world again almost unwillingly the story came out the resturant had been crowded it took norbert almost an hour to get table for himself and his date redhead from the mechtronix accounting staff it had taken three weeks of badgering for her to consent to just dinner although it was true that norbert went for men as well as women he much preferred women especialy when they were built like his current date his bisexuality extended from surprisingly pleasant experience in college besides as he often said being practising bisexual automatically doubles my chances of getting date on saturday night but tonight he was 100 hetero and glad of it from the rumors he had been hearing about this particular lady he calculated 7935 chance of getting laid tonight as dinner progressed and the small talk got less small he continually reevaluated his chances upward somewhere towards the end of the main course he was interrupted by silence dead silence all the noise clatter and gab had suddenly been cut off as if with knife slowly he turned around and was presented by an amazing tableau every human being in the room had been frozen in place like statues what had once been noisy restaurant suddenly became wax museum he turned back to his date to find that she too had been frozen he almost jumped out of his chair at the sound of footsteps behind two people were wending their way through the inanimate crowd as soon as they got close enough he gasped in recognition doug doug jumped and spun around his expression mixture of fear and hate but when he saw norbert his face split into wide grin norbert gee glad to see you how are you doin ignoring pleasantries norbert jumped up you just came in are the people outside like this or is it just the resturant oh no doug replied it just in here the place was too darn noisy so thought fix it for while when me and alice leave it ll be back to normal what the hell was he talking about you re saying you did this how doug grin faded ever so slightly tinged with the emotions his face had betrayed earlier it secret but being rude you ai nt met alice have you the woman stepped forward woodenly and extended hand hello norbert it took norbert another long moment to realize where he had seen her before gold statuette several weeks ago she stepped back and doug leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially know what you re thinkin and you re right brought her back the machine did anyway well almost all of her before norbert horrified eyes she changed instead of beautiful woan he saw rotting animated corpse mouldering flesh halfclung to yellow bone her skull was bare in places and covered by blackened shriveled skin in others bugs worms and unspeakable things crawled all over her from lidless sockets tortured eyes stared as if from the blackest pit of hell itself the eyes were the worst pleading silently for somebody anybody to rescue her from her torment norbert made gurgling noise and halfturned as he vomited splattering an inanimate couple at the next table as he held his stomach and gagged doug continued as if nothing had happened she has to pay you see pay for walking out on me pay for jumping in the sack with that damned skibum when she paid enough maybe ll fix her up right we ll see but he was talking to himself by now for norbert had fainted frank was silent for long moment finally he said already guessed most of it somehow our experiment created some sort of link between the human mind and reality machine to manipulate reality to change it to do literally anything god machine jean whispered and gave it to doug groaned norbert the interface he thought it was pretty guess and wanted it saw no harm that cube was the heart of the whole experiment the only part that did nt blow up with the rest of the equipment the power whatever has to reside in it he put his face in his hands and shuddered violently when he looked up again his face was pale ghostly we really did it did nt we he whispered jean moved over to comfort him frank ignored them both lost in his own thoughts how is it possible that kind of power does nt exist jean looked over obviously it does think maybe instead of creating link between mind and reality we managed to awaken one of the hidden potentials of the mind itself the mind does nt control the power to change reality the mind changes reality frank snorted come on are you trying to tell me that couple pounds of mildly electrified grey tissue has the power to change the world with thought that stretching credibility bit that the stuff you see in science fiction stories bad ones she turned to face him hands on hips well it just so happens that dr john kilgaren down at the university conducted some experiments to determine the power of concious thought if converted to physical terms the theoretical results were spectacular to say the frank interrupted her with howl of sarcastic laughter kilgaren wasnt he th one who managed to discredit himself when he was caught stark naked running down the football field and flapping his arms trying to fly think he claimed he was testing the aerodynamics of the human body real scientist if ever heard of of he was gasping for breath unable to continue jean furious comeback was interrupted by norbert starting to believe you two would debate the existance of gravity while building is falling in on you mean at this point who gives he had to stop for moment and collect himself before continuing who cares how he got the power and now we have to get it away from him he had their attention so he continued while you were arguing over nothing was going over our options they re limited to say the least in fact only see one chance doug our friend after all he has no reason to hate or be suspicious of us we always treated him like one of the guys something damn few people in his life have done he likes us perhaps if we were to talk to him show him what he is doing he might be open to reason jean interrupted in an uncertain tone you mean he might give it up just because we ask him and what if he does nt want to what if he gets angry at the suggestion norbert smiled halfheartedly well it been nice knowing you 10 outside they piled into norbert station wagon norbert relinquished the wheel to frank claiming that he was still too shakey to drive safely in fact he commented that it was miracle he had arrived in one piece as he had no memory of driving there at all they followed the road that wound around the butte soon they were on the streets below soon after that they were lost do nt believe this frank roared as he stopped at the fourth sevenway intersection in the last fifteen minutes what the hell happened to the roads boy scout could nt untangle this mess think dougie been having some fun norbert sighed we re going in circles jean announced pointing out frank window recognize that house me too frank replied only the blue ranchstyle next to it used to be two story duplex shit groaned norbert as he sank from sight in the back seat dammit frank slammed his palm into the wheel we ll never get there at this rate norbert voice floated up from somewhere in the back wish this thing could fly sure frank said sarcastically ll just pull back on the wheel gain some altitude the wheel suddenly titled towards him the bottom slamming into his crotch he did nt have time to even feel the pain though before his ears were filled with bonerattling roar the roar even drowned out the screams of the others as they were all pressed into their seats by approximately three gravities of accelleration the most amazing thing though was the fact that the view of the intersection in front of them had been replaced by blue sky and clouds the latter of which were approaching at respectible rate frank turned his head painfully and saw the horizon out his side window tilted ninety degrees vertically and far far below it finally occurred to him to let his foot off the accellerator as he did the pressure lessened considerably jean finally managed to gasp out turn it around before you put us in orbit frank confusedly scanned the dashboard which had suddenly become crowded with strange dials blinking lights and switches he recognized an altimeter but could nt read it to him it read twelve minutes after 4000 and getting later by the second the other dials were simply going nuts the wheel was still pressing painfully into frank lap so he pushed it up everbody stomaches suddely shot up their throats as their climb became power dive were it not for the accelleration harnesses holding them to their seats they would have been splattered against the roof of the cab blue sky was replaced by green ground approaching at terrifying speed jean was trying hard not to scream and norbert silently thanked god that he had already emptied his stomach earlier the wheel twisted in frank hands like live snake he yelped and almost let go before it became solid again it had assumed the shape of control yoke as one might find in commercial jet he had time to think about little besides the fact that they were about to have close encounter with with very hard ground he pulled back on the yoke and twisted the horizon came up and tilted crazily over the noise jean screamed quit screwing around and land how frank yelled the autopilot yelled norbert pointing between them to flashing button in the middle of the dash holding back about three million questions frank thumbed the button the yoke suddenly froze in his hands as control of the ship was taken from him moments later magnificent white deltawinged skycraft gently settled vertically in an abandoned field door mounted flush in the side slowly swung up disgorging three very disheveled figures they staggered away from the ship two leaning on each other for support the third just falling flat on his face norbert had gotten back up on his knees by the time the others reached him he stared at the skycraft my wagon my beautiful brand new he su ddenly stopped as he realized what he was staring at he stared so long that frank had to fi nally ask what norbert turned to him and said ve wanted one of those since was kid frank threw his arms up in exasperation as jean said why on earth did doug do this norbert laughed he did nt did or we did that got their attention we were in control of this transformation just like mount hood it ca nt be coincidence we must have some control of the machine too it makes sense frank murmured we were all involved in the experiment and something went through all four of us when it blew up doug was the nexus of the experiment so he gained primary control jean finished but since we were all involved we all gained some degree of control over the machine but our control must be very weak it took all three of us together to do anything norbert beamed at them knew you figure it out eventually ve an idea that the three of us together might be as powerful as doug himself maybe we can wrest control of the machine away from him not from here frank warned if he senses us trying he ll fight and then who knows what ll happen do nt want to find out we should confront him face to face distract him somehow then try let go then they got back into the airship frank was about to settle into the pilots seat when norbert put firm hand on his arm no offense he said but think should drive 11 he reclined back from the table well sated and belched contentedly fine meal he folded his arms over his stomach and noted not for the first time that he was getting fatter the one thing he could not make the cube effect was his body or his mind no matter he waved hand and the huge oaken table vanished in puff of mist that rapidly dissipated into the enormous torchlit chamber the wave or the mist was not neccesary of course but he enjoyed the dramatic gesture all the same god could indulge himself little if he wanted to douglas alvin everett aka the ruler of the universe could allow himself all the indulgences he wished who would say him nay certainly not the traitor on her hands and knees busily scrubbing corner of the chamber that redirtied itself constantly not the insignificant ants who populated this world that he currently chose to reside upon not even the gods of myth and religion whom he met briefly and even conversed with before banishing them forever from this existance no no one could threaten him now almost no one yes he had felt them the instant they utilized the power he watched amusedly as they tore through the skies in craft of their own creation he cursed as they correctly deduced the nature of the power and that they could take it away from him if they tried they thought to catch him by surprise pity he had liked them so even thought of them as friends now they would have to be eliminated before they became danger the plane slowly settled on doug front lawn the three stepped out still staring under his breath norbert mumbled he has got to be kidding in place of douglas house there stood medeval castle constructed of solid silver including the towers it rose good quarter mile above the ground as they walked closer they saw that the silver blocks making up the walls had been mortered with gold all in all very interesting effect moments later thay came to the front door which of course was drawbridge some sixty feet tall they stepped back as it was slowly silently lowered to the ground norbert swallowed hard and frank and jean held hands tightly as they entered the black portal before them actually it was nt all that black as their eyes recovered from the glare off the outside walls torches set high in the walls provided more than adeqeute illumination they came to great oaken door which opened before them greetings doug gazed down upon them benevolently from the center of the great unfurnished chamber they had to look up to meet his eyes as he was sitting crosslegged about four feet above the floor over his head shining with an awful green light was the cube off in corner was stooped figure scrubbing the floor frank stared at the figure hard then turned away queasily once he figured out what he was looking at swallowing hard he tried to keep his attention on doug greetings howhow are you doing with an expansive wave of his hand he said how do you think norbert was ignoring all this his total attention was focused on the cube so close he could almost feel it in his mind like physical object if he could just touch it with his thoughts frank had seemed to run out of things to say so jean stepped in douglas you ve got to stop it doug looked at her genuinely confused stop what using the machine you re endangering all of existance she implored am not have nt hurt anybody but his smug certainty was tinged with just trace of doubt frank interrupted maybe you have nt meant to but things are going crazy outside the human mind is nt meant to be in control of this much power there far too many variables for anyone to handle your every subconcious thought is being brought to life out there you have to stop before you destroy everything no halo of red fire encircled the chamber for second until he calmed down will not give it up all my life been nobody to be laughed at never had the brains to get very far in this world but thanks to you guys can change the world into whatever like do nt need to be as smart as everyone else now because of what you done for me gon na let you go if you walk out of here right now elsewise gon na have to do something about you they all felt it simultaneously norbert who had been focusing his attention on the cube for the last several moments finally succeeded in making contact huge green flare washed the room like tiny nova accompanied by doug scream of outrage his control was much stronger though and the cube rejected norbert wave of pure psychic power swept the room knocking everybody flat frank sat up rubbing his eyes as if that would help his headache when he saw what was going on he wished he stayed unconcious the cube shone like six sided arc lamp flooding the whole chamber with its hellish glow it pulsed as if in time to an invisible heart doug was nowhere to be seen but his voice filled the room traitors you tried to trick me you tried to take the cube away didnt he started to protest than looked over at norbert who was still unconcious he had been awfully quiet and it did nt take much to put two and two together oh no ca nt let you go ca nt trust you see that now ll have to kill you but ca nt bring myself to do it maybe wo nt have to maybe can get you to do the job for me there was another burst of light that hammered off the stone walls and then it was dark again doug looked around the room which was now empty except for himself and his slave then he sat down with heavy sigh as if he had just lost his best friend in the world 12 the first thing frank noticed after conciousness returned was that he was hot suffocating in fact the second was that he was cramped he ws curled in fetal position enclosed in something soft his head was turned to one side so there was air to breathe the third thing was that the air he was breathing stank it smelled of many things urine and mildew sweat shit and queasy gassy smell underlining it all dawning realization and slow horror drove blunt spear deep into his guts he did not want to open his eyes but he did yellow something yellow lit by light source somewhere above him covering his face covering his whole body but lightly like cloth he squeezed his eyes shut again no it was nt fair he escaped it was nt fair almost twelve years ago on december 18 1980 twentyone armed gunmen took over wellknown hotel near the portland airport their leader issued demands over the phone to the mayor office one billion dollars and 747 to take them out of the country against this they held 57 people hostage mostly night shift workers police quickly surrounded the building and the wait began on the fifth day negotiations broke down and the gunmen began throwing bodies out the door one every six hours by eleven am coroner report was recieved by the mayor revealing the fact that the four victims thrown out had been dead at least five days acting on strong hunch the chief of police ordered the swat teams in and damn the hostages that decision ultimately cost him his career but the siege was ended twelve officers and all twentyone gunmen were killed in the battle that followed when the smoke cleared scene of horror was revealed the chief hunch had been correct all fiftyseven hostages had been herded into laundry room and then executed by submachine gun there was evidence that the killers had gone among the bodies and used knives to finish the job the guns had started however there had been one survivor young man had had the presence of mind to hide by jumping into laundry cart and pulling dirty sheets over him six days he had remained in that cart in his own filth and sweat breathing he stench produced by almost five dozen decaying corpses in that enclosed room afraid to move even one inch for fear of being discovered he had been barely able to walk as he was led out of the building christmas 1980 was nt very happy one for the friends and relatives of sixtyeight people and one survivor six years of intense outpatient therapy slowly healed the more obvious scars on this young man psyche he eventualy learned to deal with the guilt irrational though it was of not being able to save his friends but the nighmares continued it was rare night that he did not wake up in cold sweat feeling as if he were suffocating even after twelve years the ghosts of the massacre continued to haunt his dreams and they probably would until he died and the dreams were always the same one day he would wake up curled in ball in that same laundry cart covered by stinking yellow blanket to the smell of slowly rotting meat thanks to douglas ebert all of frank lindstrom nightmares were finally coming true he lay there for god or doug they were pretty much the same thing these days only knew how long fear had him frozen unable to move at all if he could keep hidden perhaps he could escape again he done it before all the strength left him as he heard door slam loud rough voice said told ya he in here somewhere look in everything especially the laundry carts that was it somehow they knew probably doug doing just like everything else tired resignation swept over him as he waited to be found but they did nt find him right away he could hear them stumbling everywhere else in the room frank supposed this was some attempt at mental torture to make things unbearable before finishing him that sounded like something doug would do it might have worked except it was nt fear he felt it was anger twelve years of frustration at the atrocity that had crippled his life for so long and on top of that was the growing rage he felt at doug for tearing open wounds that should never have been touched again doug had hit all the right buttons but they no longer did what he thought they would with scream of outrage he jumped up tearing the blanket aside he saw two men both frozen in astonishment mouths agape immediately he jumped from the cart onto the nearest one still stunned the man did not move frank landed on top of him with elbow in his solar plexus the breath whooshed out of him and he lost all interest in his uzi which frank grabbed the second man was just bringing his weapon up as frank swung around the uzi bucked and roared spitting fire from its muzzle the man jerked about like marionette wih its strings fouled as blood sprayed the tiles behind him the tiles themselves exploded as the slugs struck them frank stopped firing and the man fell to the floor twitching he felt movement under him the guy he had jumped on had regained some of his wind and was struggling to get up frank placed the muzzle under the guy chin and pulled the trigger brains and bone and blood exploded everywhere splattering him he stood up covered with blood and grey tissue grinning like madman he hefted the smoking submachine gun and headed for the door maybe just maybe he could take them all he surprised three more out in the hall like the others before them they froze for fraction of second probably at his appearance he jerked the trigger and fanned the muzzle across the corridor as stomach height the bullets punched amazingly large holes in the walls blood sprayed from the three in red mist as they went down he howled victory as he jumped over the bodies sprinting down the hall death filled his thoughts and he intended to bring it to everyone in the building in revenge for his friends and for jean and norbert wherever they may be he turned corner and was blinded by dozen flashbulbs as familiar stuttering roar pounded his ears his torso was instant agony as he flew backwards slamming into wall he slid down into slouched sitting position as he saw that man in front of him with another uzi still smoking from the barrel he looked down and saw no less than six holes in his chest and stomach all jetting blood he could even see his insides working what was left of them blackness began to cloud his vision as the man kneeled in front of him he wore grin and frank was horrified to see that it was doug he had come to do the job himself frank tried to spit something out final curse but blood only bubbled from between his lips doug placed the muzzle against frank nose and the last thing he saw was flash that filled the world before everything exploded 13 jean opened her eyes and stretched luxuriously on the couch shaft of warm afternoon sunlight spilled across her body from the picture window counteracting the chill that ran through her what nightmare she picked up the book that was resting on the coffee table stephen king novel she stared at it for long second and put it back down shaking her head slowly why did she read such trash it gave her such awful nightmares the dream itself had been all but forgotten torn to etherial wisps upon her awakening but sense of wrongness remained it was as if she had fallen asleep into pleasant dream and would soon reawaken to the nightmare despite the warming solar rays she shivered again suddenly the voice of her mother floated from another room wholesome and reassuring in her disorientation jean dear would you do me favor and go downstairs to get the laundry think the dryer done sure mom she got up and walked into the kitchen everything was just as she remembered it but why should nt it be the last time she had been in here was to make sandwich before falling asleep on the couch right the wrongness returned for just second and then left again she brushed it off as lingering afteraffect of her nightmare and turned to open the cellar door diffuse light from the curtained window in the backyard door kept the steps well lit on the first landing the basement itelf was dark though she flicked the lightswitch above the bannister but the darkness remained for second she debated getting flashlight but what the heck she could see well enough barely slowly cautiously she decended down the longer flight of steps that led into the darkness something in the back of her head screamed for her to turn back now before it was too late at the bottom she began walking cautiously halffeeling her way towards the washer the huge greyblack bulk of the oil furnace was off to her right she looked at it for long second and shivered its squat cylindrical shape and the five ventpipes that ran from its cylindrical to to the ceiling at strange angles had always looked to her like some huge steel heart in the half light the illusion was enhanced considerably cautiously she skirted around it her own heart pounding in her chest suddenly the furnace hissed and then boomed softly to life scaring the hell out of her flickering light floated out of the four holes in the little door in the front she had more than half expected the sides to crumple inward then bulge out beating with slow horrible rhythem the heart of the house damn she cursed herself what wrong with you you re not five years old anymore things like that just do nt happen in the real world after chewing herself out she felt better but still shaky something was wrong but she just could nt put her finger on it she was suddenly ten times as anxious to finish her task and get back up into the sunlight where everything was all right again now the sidebyside white boxes of the washer and dryer were before her barely visible in the dim light she reached down to the front of the one on the right to open the door on the way her hand plunged into something that felt like cloth but it tore too easily yeeeuuuccchhh she jerked her hand back brushing the thick cobweb off the size of it amazed her now that she saw it it ran from the floor to one corner on the front triangle of solid silvergrey how could spider build something this big in the hour or so since her mother had put the wash in she looked towards the back of the basement and saw that there were similar webs strung all over the place back there it was too thick to even see the far wall it looked like the inside of caterpillar nest she felt her sandwich churn sickly in her stomach as she slowly backed away something skittered up her arm she screamed and slapped her shoulder she came away with something in her hand that writhed between her forefinger and thumb tiny legs tickled her thumb and she threw the spider down but not before feeling hot horrible sting right in the center of the pad it hurt like fire and she rubbed it against her sweater as she almost ran back to the stairs but the stairs were nt there anymore dumbfounded she stared at the door lighted rectangle of hope an safety four feet above her head who took the stairs the wrongness returned shaking her right to the core this time it did nt go away and small wonder she had walked into doug trap the information and the returning memories that accompanied it did her no good undoubtedly as intended suddenly she heard noise behind her it was steady soft rustle for second reminding her of ocean waves on the shore in the distance not wanting to she turned slowly around black tidal wave was rising in the far end of the basement it crested and rushed towards her with terrifying speed she turned and jumped for the door her fingernails striking and tearing against the concrete one inch below the step something soft and heavy slammed into her back before her feet hit the floor and she went down spiders millions of them they covered her entire body like cocoon skittering crawling biting her clothes offered little protection as they were quickly chewed away followed by her skin she held her eyes and mouth shut against an iron scream as her chest began burning for want of air the pain soon rose to spectacular levels finally quite against her will her mouth opened and the scream escaped quite lost on her arachnid adversaries while her mouth was open huge hairy tarantula crawled in there was gag of revulsion and her jaws involuntarily clicked shut the creature abdomen burst between her teeth and her mouth was filled with hideously bland fluid while the rest of the spider continued to writhe at the back of her throat her stomach gave one great heave and her sandwich her milk most of her breakfast and maybe her stomach itself exploded from her mouth in violent spray clearing it out mostly she shut it again quickly before something else could come in her teeth crunched on leg that had nt come out but there was no way in god green earth she open up to spit it out the repulsive bile and acid that her stomach had sent up tasted like ambrosia now they were still biting her and she could see blood jetting out from dozen places under the black mass that covered her the pain was actually fading becoming more diffuse as the wounds multiplied and her conciousness faded with silent sigh she relaxed waiting for unconciousness and death to take her noise made her open her eyes when she realized what she was looking at she opened her mouth spiders be damned and screamed loud and long the furnace was moving the dirty sheet metal sides crumpled in and bulged out again and again in slow rhythem accompanied by loud wet thumpthump that vibrated the floor beneath her finally the metal bulged out out and shattered sending flying hooks of metal everywhere brilliant pain flared in her left eye before it went dark forever but she hardly noticed when she saw what was beneath the metal real heart seven feet tall covered with veins as thick as her forearm pulsed before her the spiders had vanished and she looked down at herself with her one good eye most of her skin was gone along with one leg one breast was missing she could see white ribs where it should have been she could see her intestines grey ropy coils writhing in her abdomen incredibly there was no pain just kind of numbness her mind was as sharp as ever it was as if she was looking at someone else body but she knew it was hers please god she prayed silently let me die and god answered of course my dear was just waiting for you to ask he answered in doug voice the giant heart lurched towards her the arteries ripping from the ceiling with sound like heavy wet cloth tearing it rolled forward closer and closer jetting black blood from the severed arteries it landed on her and heavy weight pushed her grateful conciousness out of existance norbert he was being shaken drawn from the comforting blackness enveloping him he did nt want to wake up norbert wake up he should nt be asleep this was he jerked his head up eyes open instantly painful cramps shot through his back and stomach that what you get for falling asleep at school desk he rubbed his eyes grainy and tired his mouth tasted like something had crawled in it and died it was as if he had been asleep million years surprised at you norbert you re one of the last students have expected to fall asleep during my class he looked up to see mr horwell his eleventhgrade english teacher glaring down at him why should he be surprised everybody fell asleep during horwell classes the man teaching methods made english four letter word spelled dull ii sorry sir was up all last night cramming for my final tomorrow do nt want to fail cramming hm up all night watching mtv would be more like it screw you too horseface norbert thought grimly well you had better not study so hard tonight you do nt get any extra points for dozing off during test now get out of here norbert looked around all the other desks were empty the bell must have rung at least he was spared the embarassment of being chewed out in front of the whole class yes sir he replied the sir coming out as anything but respectful outside the hall was empty how long had horseface let him sleep for crying out loud the buses were probably all gone and now norbert would have to find some other way to get home nice guy that horwell norbert hoped he would die of intestinal cancer and very soon cheered by the thought norbert began humming some zz top and hiked down the hallway towards the front door it was quiet too quiet he passed not single person in the halls there should have been few stragglers some teachers maybe even few jocks on their way to practice school was never completely empty until the janitor closed the place up for the night this one apparently was though he hustled little faster towards the front more than little anxious to get out hey pizzaface the syllables rang out harsh and loud making him jump he spun around quickly three hulking young men in motorcycle jackets faced him halfway down the hall the largest among them was sixtwo blond perfect representative of the aryan stereotype except for the eyes which were like flat painted wood no real emotion rested in those eyes or their owner despite himself norbert was shaking whatwhat do you want who are you wooden grin split the young man features making him even more menacing he spoke like bored sixthgrader reciting overmemoriezed lines for the school play call me ace he pulled something that looked like bar casually out of his back pocket dull gold about six inches long with double row of holes along it side he flicked his wrist with fluid triple motion clackclackclack the bar had grown by five inches of razored steel he bounced the butterfly knife in his palm for second then pointed with it your throat or your balls norbert mouth suddenly went dry his heart pounded in the base of his throat wwhat you ask too many questions wimp make me mad enough and you ll lose both now choose norbert backed away ready to run his schoolbooks fell to the floor forgotten before he got two steps though he bumped into wall or so he though incredibly strong hands encircled his arms above the elbows gripping him cruelly hard pinning him he struggled to no avail ace walked up to him with slow mechanical deliberatness he stopped within arm reach still smiling that dead smile should have chose when you had the chance now get to think ll start with the guts he drew the knife back to strike the knife flashed across in silvery sideways arc without thinking norbert brought his hand up to block the blade too late he realized the stroke had been feint meant to scare rather than hurt the tip connected with his hand he pulled back and stared at the wound gash ran sideways across the back it had pulled open at the sides like misplaced mouth muscles ligaments and tendons had been severed revealing white bone scored by the force of the slash the skin around the wound was dead white already going to purple he stared at the inside of his hand for one grotesque second before the wound filled with crimson running over and spilling onto the floor norbert head spun dizzily and he was sure he was going to puke his hand did nt hurt much yet but it refused to move through the roaring in his ears harsh contrived laughter floated when faced with imminent death there was no doubt in his mind soe men will simply fold others however will fight out of sheer desperation accepting hopeless odds over none at all norbert had always secretly thought of himself as one of the former so apparently did his tormentors then he surprised them all his knee shot up into ace crotch whatever this thing before him was it had something in common with real human male ace dropped the knife and folded to the ground with groan that sounded as sincere as three dollar bill his accomplices bent down to help him norbert lifted both feet and slammed them down on the insteps of the punk holding him satisfyingly human scream sounded in his ear as the pressure on his biceps vanished he blundered past his former captor and ran down the hallway from somewhere behind came phony yell of outrage and then footsteps following the whole weight of the world seemed to rest on his sneakers every step was an effort blood poured from his hand drenching his pants and the floor he wanted to wrap something around the wound but dared not stop to try around corner was the rear exit twin steel doors with wired glass windows showing blessed safety beyond if he could just get out of the building he would be safe an inner voice told him this the same voice that told him he would die if he remained he ran towards the doors good hand extended to open them they were locked it took him second to regain his senses he was on his ass in front of the doors which remained inviolate except for splatter of blood on one of the windows he felt his nose which was squashed to one side broken warm fluid poured down his face and stained his shirt why was there no pain voice from much too close behind he around this corner he struggled to his feet next to the doors was staircase leading to the upper wing gripping the bannister with his good hand he stumbled up it the upper hall was just as deserted as the rest of the building there were rows of lockers on each side with classroom doors interspersed between them he tried each door but they were all locked the only door that was open led to the other stairwell he paused for long moment staring down the stairs panic loss of blood or something else made the distance down stretch from feet to miles his vision blurred as the vast empty space seemed to fill with fog he caught himself second before he would have fallen must have greyed out there it would have been bad if gotcha something slammed into his back and his pitched forward his extended his hands forward instinctively to cushion himself his injured hand hit the step just right and the bones already weakened snapped with sound like four pencils wrapped in cotton as his hand bent double in the middle of the palm then there was pain incredible undescribably agony that slammed up his arm and racked his body making the rest of his tumble downstairs seem enjoyable by comparison he came to rest at the bottom with dozen broken bones the pain from his ruined hand eclipsed all else and it was all he could do to whimper as he lay there in heap shadow fell over him through haze of pain he saw the man with the wooden eyes grinning down at him after long moment he said you had to make me mad now you re going to have your balls for breakfast and your heart for dessert he knelt down his knife held before him like surgeons scalpel norbert had thought he had reached his limit of pain he had been wrong his screams echoed echoed throughout the empty building loud and long until they were choked off as if somebody had jammed something in his mouth to silence him 15 outside it was raining it was not simply the worst storm in recorded history it was the worst storm in the history of this ancient and decrepit planet raindrops the size of refrigerators and weighing upwards of two thousand pounds each hammered the landscape like bombs mach three winds tore at everything above ground lightning bolts mile wide blasted unbelievable craters the land had been long ago scoured down to bedrock for three hundred miles in every direction outside of this area it was as calm as mild summer day in the center of this destruction sat castle of fine silver untouched by the fury that raged around it inside doug was crying pathetic sobs were wrung out of him echoing about the great dark chamber before him floated three spheres the size of grapefruits when he had banished his friends to their respective fates the spheres had appeared all three glowing with fierce light now two of them were dim flickering unsteadily the third had gone out completely remorse had overwhelmed him evnveloping him in his own black cocoon of misery why did they have to do it they were his friends if they hadnt tried to take the cube away everything would have been all right there was no need he was nt hurting anybody anybody that mattered anyway but they had and in fit of rage he had banished them to their own individual private hells exquisitely terrifying fates brought to life in their own pocket realities courtesy of the cube he could almost feel their agony as the spheres pulsed weaker before him soon they would all be dead and he would be damned forever why was he doing this why was he powerless to stop cold bony hand fell on his shoulder he jumped slightly then tuned around alice had left her brush and now stood beside him rags hung on her rotting frame her skin yellowed and flaked revealing moist white bone underneath great lidless eyes stared at him from parchment covered skull maggots crawled in her hair what there was of it her lower jawbone moved and though there was no apparatus to do so she spoke you are not powerless you can stop this any time you want he stared at her incredulously for one long second then said shut up and get back to work do nt want to listen to you no she replied you do want to listen to me which is why here you know what you re doing is wrong and your indecision has released me go away his voice was sullen whimper he did nt want to hear this in hopes might persuade you to do what you know is the right thing you re hurting people lots of them and the ones you love most of go away his voice had risen to roar that literally shook the planet blast of solid light shot from the cube disintegrating her body in brilliant flash from the resultant smoke cloud an irregular object clattered heavily to the flagstones the skull bounced and rolled few feet then came to rest its jawbone still moving like some manic windup toy her voice persisted maddeningly all wo nt go away ca nt you yourself wo nt allow it bring them back restore everything to the way it was before it too late the sight of her still moving skull he had meant to blast her out of exisitence had unmanned him the doubts that had plauged him for the last few weeks became vast impenatrable walls it now seemed he had actually been standing outside himself watching in helpess horrified fascination as some unknown madman took control of his body and will capering about and rearranging literally everything to suit his whims it had nt been him it had nt been him had it before it too late the skull implored do nt know how he did nt he did nt know how to do anything anymore the greatest power in the universe rested in his hands his mind whatever and he was scared to use it he suddenly realized it for what it really was not playtoy not an obedient servant but great raging beast with capabilities far beyond his meager imagination it controlled him as much or more than he controlled it now he felt trying to use that power would be like normal person trying to grab naked high voltage wire quite possibly with the same results his voice wavered ca nt just dont know the skull was silent for moment considering then it spoke again maybe you could with help help yes powerful ray of hope tore through his fear he was nt alone there were others who could control the cube as well maybe they would know what to do all doubts forgotten he once again grasped the power welcoming it like an old familiar friend the three spheres swelled before him suddenly then burst like thunder norbert sat up his head aching what had happened last thing he remembered was the three of them standing before doug trying to talk reason with him then poof sounds penetrated through the ringing in his ears slowly resolving themselves into soft feminine sobs he looked over and saw jean cradling frank still form what was wrong deep inside he thought he knew shakily he stood up and walked over to her he kneeled down before them frank eyes were closed and serene expression rested on his features after long moment jean looked up into norbert eyes tears still rolling down her cheeks with an effort she summoned up choked voice he dead 16 frank was stone cold dead she touched his face cold unresponding like wax she laid his head down gently on the stone floor she picked up his hands and placed them on his chest unbidden tear fell on his face and rolled slowly down his cheek jean sniffled twice then looked up doug kneeled at the far end of the chamber watching with wounded eyes slowly he shook his head denying responsibility for everything norbert never had very much experience with people but still he thought he knew what was going to happen next he was right you baaasstaaarrrddd lithe muscles tensed she sprung at doug with an animal scream of rage norbert managed to jump and grab her pinning her in bear hug she hurled curses at doug and norbert as the most powerful man in the universe cowered back whimpering like beaten dog strong he had never been jean rage had raised her adrenaline levels until she became almost impossible to hold if she broke free norbert knew she would injure doug and doug would let her and the cube responding to doug pain and quite beyond his control would react in ways that were terrifying to contemplate finally jean collapsed in norbert arms sobbing exhaustedly he eased his grip on her slightly remaining on guard now that the air had cleared for moment he was able think again the solution he knew was obvious he turned to doug and spoke three words stunned silence decended over the chamber jean turned her face up to him terror confusion and wild glimmer of hope fought within her eyes what did you say norbert continued to face doug sternly and repeated in quiet commanding voice bring him back doug cowered farther back into the corner the corner moving back to accomodate him and whimpered ii ca nt you do nt underst bring him back now jean surged wildly in norbert arms almost breaking free do it now you worthless piece of shit or ll break your neck the air filled with static tension everyone skin tingled and felt tight doug had curled up into fetal position arms tight over his head the cube hovered over them shining with light that felt warm and benign in this moment norbert suddenly noticed that there was skull lying on its side against one wall alert eyes still rested in its sockets and he knew they were watching him suddenly he heard low groan the skull eyes moved to stare behind him the first thing frank saw as he opened his eyes was jean beautiful face in that split instant even before full awareness returned he knew he loved her he did nt care what the situation was or how desperate or whether the world might end in the next second the only thing that mattered now right now was that he loved this woman with all his heart and soul and he must tell her about it somehow his voice failed him so he simply reached up wrapped his arms around her and pulled her down to him he felt her sobbing quietly into his chest and knew it was good that everything would be fine now though she spoke no words he knew she loved him too and her love filled him with great golden warmth slowly but surely obliterating the chilling memories of the terrifying emptiness he had just been rescued from norbert watched the lovers for moment then turned away to give them their privacy he studied the tattered skull with the eyes which studied him back the skull jawbone moved and voice echoed in his mind whatsa matter see something green he jumped startled and little embarassed he turned back to jean and frank privacy be damned frank was getting up unsteadily jean supporting him he walked over to norbert gaining strength and balance with each step he gave tired smile to show that he was all right in voice that betrayed only the slightest shakiness he asked what did miss norbert relayed the events of the last few moments as he understood them frank rubbed his chin thoughtfully doug losing it the powers frightening him now for some reason which makes him more dangerous than ever norbert reminded him it also our best chance frank replied he walked over to doug who was still curled into ball he flinched away from frank touch go away cmon doug you know ca nt we ve still got work to do we need the cube and your help to restore everything to normal douglas looked up at him with pity in his eyes as if frank were an idiot child you do nt understand do you you just do nt know what it like it ca nt be done of course it can frank argued gently mindful of who he was talking to the power can do anything you said it yourself do it myself if had control of the cube sudden wild hope filled doug voice you want it what frank responded brilliantly taken somewhat aback the cube you want it well then take it douglas released control of the cube they all felt it like an immensely tall tower falling with the cube at its tip the base of the tower the control nexus of the machine sank into the soft gossamer of frank mind with all the cold immense weight of the cube behind it he felt the power the incredible electricity infuse his very being in one brilliant instant he knew he knew and then he screamed 17 omniscience new door opened in his mind the blinders had been removed and for the first time in his life he could really see everything terrifying flood of information infinitely beyond human comprehension exploded in his mind threatening to wash his awareness away to oblivion leaving him burned out mindless husk too much he narrowed his vision thought was all it took now the spiral of the milky way galaxy was in his mind eye he saw every detail simultaneously down to the basic components of every atom comprising its structure he reeled at pattern far too vast for his human conciousness to grasp it was meaningless all too meaningless he found himself beginning to slip into an ennui from which he would never return he narrowed one more time to magnificent bluewhite globe floating around some minor star somewhere in the outskirts of the galaxy home self here something was wrong he still could nt think encumbered by the weight of the information his mind was trying to assimilate dimly he sensed that this was dangerous and not just to himself he narrowed his focus for the last time he was seeing now with eyes he was in large room too dark florescent fixtures blazed along the ceiling bringing illumination up to more than adequete levels much better four beings in the room besides himself he had some difficulty telling them apart as mortal man might have telling one ant from another but one stood out from the others female body mostly destroyed but life force still bright and vital trapped in dead husk by the predecessor he sensed wrongness about this and set out to correct it since doug had uttered those final words there had been silence jean and norbert watched anxiously as frank stood bathed in the glow of the cube eyes focused on some distant unknowable point then the fluorescents appeared on the ceiling then they heard soft pop as air was pushed aside to make room for something materializing norbert turned to the source of the sound and gasped alice ebert stood intact on the exact spot where once rested an animated skull she was dressed in jeans and loose fitting sweater and appeared in perfect health very unlike the first time he saw her those weeks ago she looked down at her hands puzzled then all uncertainty left her face as she rushed over to doug they sat on the cold stone floor in each other arms quietly sobbing like lovers long separated but at last reunited simple matter to restore her body and adjust her memories little frank was not sure why he did this but some distant part of his mind told him that balance had been restored he turned his attention elsewhere another balance one much more critical needed to be restored he turned his vision deep into the structure of the universe itself far deeper than mortals even imagined existed yet pure lines of force brilliant crystalline they rayed out from every particle to every other in the universe they formed vast incomprehensible pattern but the pattern had been sundered in working its changes the cube had fractured and severed many of the lines until the whole pattern threatened to buckle and reality itself would dissolve into chaos entropy then total dissolution nothing would be left with the cube aid he turned his mind to the greatest task that would ever be demanded of it one by one he began reconnecting the lines some of them would nt return to their original places so he improvised new patterns formed from the old the castle dissappeared the five of them were left standing in the middle of grassy meadow jean looked up and saw the sky turn green then red then shade of blue slightly duller than before slight twinge of nausea shot through her as gravity pulsed beneath her feet making her about four pounds lighter looking at her feet she saw she was casting three shadows yes there were three suns one on the horizon one at high noon and one way the hell off to the north if that still was north then clouds instantly filling the sky roaring deluge of flaming hailstones erupted from the clouds only to vanish before touching the ground then it was night with green sun burning brilliantly in the naked airless sky then things started to get weird the stars rained from the sky and landed in the field around them quietly smouldering norbert bent down to touch one and pulled his blistered hand back quickly an enormous futuristic city sprang from the dirt around them and dissolved to dust in the space of one second the green sun went supernova becoming huge shaeless blob from horizon to horizon and filling the sky with great tearing roar and turning it color never seen before in the universe the ground shuddered as though somebody had dropped the moon on the earth norbert supposed that was entirely possible great bald head glared at them angrily from over the horizon douglas shrieked and fainted then the walls of te chamber sprang up around thm and they were safe from the chaos outside for the moment frank expression remained distant and he had not moved since all this started another connection made the pattern was becoming stable if not exactly familiar deep in the still mortal recesses of his brain frank realized what doug had been trying to tell him he could no more restore this mangled tapestry to its former state any more than gorilla could assemble 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle it was too far beyond him to be anything but ludicrous perhaps the cube itself could do anything but the limits of the mind controlling it was another matter entirely he was almost done an hour later jean asked tiredly what happening now no idea norbert sighed just as tired nothing had happened since the walls had returned and he hoped frank was going to return to the real world soon as the chamber door would nt open and frank had thoughtlessly neglected to include bathroom in the room reconstruction somebody squawked behind him and he turned around doug was sitting up staring at something they could nt see alice was trying to get him to lay back down honey you ve got to rest you ve been through so much something happening doug quavering voice cut through them leaving vauge sense of terror something was happening finished he mentally stood back moment and admired his handiwork not bad for human where had he heard that before there was one problem left the cube had to go it was possible he could expel the cube from his mind but it would only gravitate towards another like magnet his brief but intimate association with the cube had taught him great many things when he returned to normal existance he would not be the same person he might not even be human he had made the cube he had instilled it with irresistable power he could destroy it he knew how even though all his insticts screamed against trying it if the cube could do anything it could surely do this he commanded the cube to unmake itself there was only shocked silence in the chamber as frank collapsed to the floor unmoving unbreathing 18 it was spectacular he saw past the six chrome sides to the true essense of the cube itself not cube at all but living breathing thing of hundred dimensions cubes within cubes within cubes frameworks of energy revolving and moving in designs of unspeakable power it lived as it was too powerfu not to but it was mindless it needed mind supplied by sentient host but this time mind had commanded suicide and the cube could do nothing but attempt to comply power without power within great tides of energy raged against the sides of the cube only to be turned back by the far greater power inside it was like gentle spring breeze trying to destroy mountain but the forces involved here were far more intense something had to give eventually something did frank realized his mistake fraction too late where the cube had rested before him was now ragged gaping hole the seething mass that was the cube essense had shot through the hole and into the blackness beyond frank still connected with the cube found himself pulled through the hole as well meanwhile back in the material world jean was cradling frank head his mouth hung slack and his eyes stared at nothing in particular he did not breathe when she looked up at norbert her eyes were bright with barely controlled tears in small halting voice she said he ll be back it not real none of it real he ca nt die again he just has one more thing to take care of one thing he ll be back she retured her gaze to those blind eyes softly whispering love you baby love you so much please come back sick to his heart norbert turned away he knew frank was beyong hearing now but frank did hear her lovely voice echoed across the incredible gulf in which he now floated the mindless shriek of the cube faded behind him as he severed his final link with it lest he be carried to whatever fate awaited it he was outside the universe 19 it was void vast immeasurable but by no means empty great pastel spheres floated like bubbles in the black space there were billions of them fading with distance to specks of light they were every color known to man and vast number more that were nt they were transparent he could see into them trillions of specks of light sparkled within he suddenly realized what they were other universes the specks were stars or perhaps galaxies who knew now that the final echoes of the cube departure had faded from his ears he discovered that the void around him was nt entirely silent faint at first then growing louder as he hearing adjusted music ephermal ghostly humming from the spheres themselves they changed in tone and pitch in alien rhythem all the spheres were singing what else could he call it forming chorus of unthinkably vast scale and incredible beauty tears of joy at the music ran down nonexistant cheeks something drew his attention downward towards one of the closest spheres shining with pale maroon light hellishly brilliant spark of light was falling towards its surface the machine it struck the surface with huge flash and the whole sphere recoiled at the violation it fell silent for moment heart between beats then began singing again with its own harsh rhythem becoming note of discord among the chorus the machine was somebody else problem now frank hoped they would be able to deal with it better than he had he had done all he could ffffffffrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnkkkkkkkkk jean voice distorted to low moan by the time differential between her world and here her voice rolled and echoed among the spheres causing more discord like band that had been distracted and lost its place he could see her face through the hole still before him he knew he was actually seeing through his real eyes in his body back in the real world but somehow her face was fuzzy indistinct he was losing contact he had to make his way back to the hole quickly before it closed forever leaving him stranded here coming honey the hole grew closer and her face clearer as he approached he was coming back coming home to her to his friends to all the familiar comforts of the known world that he suddenly achingly missed but most of all was coming back to the warmth of her love and he knew deep in his heart he would never never leave again the spheres resumed their song much more powerfully than before their eerie electric chorus struck chord deep within him stirring some dimly understood longing that went back deep into his ancestry long before life even existed on earth stay stay with us he hesitated torn here existed secrets no human would ever uncover not in billion years of evolution the other universes called to him inviting him to explore their wonders to return would mean being tortured forever by the memory of place he could never see again the music washed over him filling him with joy no earthly emotion could hope to match one minute just one minute more to enjoy the music then he would come back never to leave again one more minute jean voice echoed out to frank again but he could no longer hear her he was completely enraptured by the music of the spheres 20 the weather was appropriate for frank funeral grey sheets of drizzle pelted down dampening the spirits and clothes of those attending quite effectively it seemed the heavens themselves were mourning the loss of one who had given everything to save everything the minister finished the graveside service in monotonous bored voice and closed his book quietly after moment of silence the small crowd not reluctantly broke up and made for their cars the cough and rumble of engines starting soon fading with distance eventually there was only four left standing beneath makeshift canvas shelter staring down on pathetic mound of dirt that meant far more than the world would ever know the cause of death was listed as heart attack the true story would be forever sealed in the hearts and minds of the four and would eventually die with them norbert put his arm tentatively around jean shoulders she flinched but did not move away norbert always hated funerals but it was thousand times worse when it was the funeral of good friend his heart was heavy but he knew his pain was not fraction of what jean must be feeling she had loved frank he would have traded everything he had in the world for the words that would break through her grief and make her smile once again her wounds ran deep but were not mortal and would eventually heal with time but still he felt he had to say something effecting lighthearted tone that sounded about as real as three dollar bill he said he not really dead you know he somewhere out there exploring probably you know how he always wanted to know how everything worked when he gets tired of floating around the universe he might even come back she was looking at him now her expression unreadable sudden terror seized him had he salved her pain or driven wedge in even deeper bringing forth new freshet of grief why had he opened his mouth at all but she hugged him her face tight against his chest know youre trying to help she whispered just hold me please and be quiet he did and although he thought he might have done more damage than good he realized that he had broken through and maybe with just little care things might be all right after all he felt his pulse quicken imperceptably at her closeness and wondered just how deep his feelings ran for this woman anyway he put the thought down as quickly as it came up and berated himself for sick opportunistic creep doug stared at the grave for long time then he fell to his knees and broke out crying in harsh braying sobs alice was right down there with him trying to be comforting but he would have none of it did it killed him all my fault if just hadnt that enough they were all staring at jean who had pulled away from norbert and now glared at doug with fierce bright eyes she walked over to him with deliberate strides and knelt in front of him putting her hands on his cringing shoulders she stared into his eyes then her expression softened it not your fault she said gently it our we were playing with something that was never meant to be disturbed you ended up with the final result it was too much for anyone to handle but it was not just your responsibility the machine controlled you more than you controlled it frank died and she swallowed hard at this frank died to correct mistake we all made it was his choice you did not do it to him do you understand doug nodded numbly jean sighed wearily and they got up she walked back to norbert leaving doug and alice to their privacy she envied them the life they were going to have the life she could never share with frank now as she passed norbert she said let go okay need good stiff drink and some sleep tomorrow we have to get on with out lives norbert replied something in the affirmative and followed behind inwardly jean wondered at this newfound strength that welled up within her it suddenly seemed that there would be tomorrow whole string of tomorrows that extended into future that seemed far brighter than it had an hour ago future that she discovered would ideally include norbert after all somebody had to look after him and keep him out of trouble the drizzle had stopped and the clouds broken up into puffs of grey and white revealing dazzling greygreen sky sol alpha was high overhead while sol beta rested on the horizon still covered by clouds the picture jarred jean as she sat down in norbert car it was reminder that only four people in the world would ever know that the sky was once blue and held only one sun it served as reminder that their whole world had changed and she knew virtually nothing of it tomorrow she would begin taking steps to correct that somehow she had feeling that her grief would fade soon she would be much too busy to dwell upon it for long long time she had whole brand new world to discover the end xx another file downloaded from nirvananet tm the temple of the screaming electron jeff hunter 5109355845 salted slug systems strange 4084549368 burn this flag zardoz 4083639766
