the problem with timetravel the problem with timetravel alwyn mused as he sat gently rocking his great great grandfather was that contrary to popular belief and in contradiction to most of the known laws of nature at least the ones reported in the popular science pages of sunday supplements it was entirely feasible the baby on his lap burped and gently deposited thin stream of warm milk up his sleeve sighing alwyn transferred him to the other arm and began delicate moppingup operation with mauve silk pockethandkerchief it had all started one fine spring morning as many of such tales do alwyn had been working on his latest invention strange device that was supposed to cut down the time needed to cook christmas pudding by at least half alwyn was one of those pencilbehindeachear absentminded professors who were always at loss when it came to finding something to write note to the milkman with yes he had long straggly white beard which he was indeed fond of stroking and the obligatory cat black one his lab was full of strange bits of this and that and pieces of the other all strung together by miles of rainbow wire somewhere at the heart of the mess was half an old television with three of the valves ripped out number of radios bits from longdefunct computers and the starter coils from an antiquated robin reliant that now sat gathering dust outside the potting shed mingled in fond embrace sealed by blobs of solder and bits of blutack in one of the more remote corners of the lab small half eaten cheese and pickle sandwich was wired up to the entrails of toaster what the mould colony rapidly estab lishing complex civilization on the sandwich felt about this history does not say at the focus of all this attention was small opensided box more of cage in actual fact constructed of crisscrossing assembly of copper rods and inside the box resplendent amidst the chaos on gleaming white wedge wood plate was small black sticky christmas pudding with tired sprig of holly gamely trying to spread its leaves in decorative way on its top alwyn made his way over to one side of the lab where huge switch of the pullthistocreatefrankenstein variety sprouted out of the side of metal cabinet resting innocuously in the off position he switched it as one usually does with switches crackle of electricity that spiked his hair and nasty ozoney smell later alwyn picked himself up off the dusty floor and dashed over to the other side of the lab the cage was still there its bars glowing redhot but the plate and its contents had vanished this was slight setback alwyn even in his dazed state could appreciate the fact that no cook no matter how pressed for time would be happy to vapourise their christmas pudding in the name of science not unless they were dieting anyway sighing as he contemplated lean supper he went to turn off the machine there was sudden explosion of displaced air and the merry shattering sound that only hor ribly expensive china can make shards of wedgewood flew around the lab one just clipping his ear alwyn felt his ear gingerly despite hurting enough to make him feel faint it had suffered only minor scratch distractedly licking the blood from his fingers his racing mind analyzing the metallic taste he wandered over to the smoking remains of his gutted equipment inside the cage was tiny pile of white dust surmounted by wrinkled shrivelled brown holly leaf that had given up all pretence of being decorative he reached out slowly to touch the leaf and withdrew his hand hastily sucking his fingers the leaf was so cold it had burnt him as if to repay him for the terrible experience it had obvi ously undergone the leaf crumbled in tiny tinkle of fal ling crystals the days and nights were punctuated by the loud sounds of furious inventing his equipment melted down so often that he hardly bothered with clearing it up any more merely bolting the next machine onto the smoking remains of its predecessor at last alwyn reached two conclusions one of them obvious and the other revolutionary in the extreme firstly whatever happened to be at the focus of his machine when it was switched on vanished this was the easy observation and was hardly likely to win him any nobel prizes secondly when the machine was turned off again it reappeared and lastly he found out where they went or more precisely when back in time now smart readers will notice that makes three conclusions but just did nt want to spoil the surprise earlier not so astute readers please count again why good question that alwyn asked himself repeatedly the problem with questions even the best is that they demand answers and this one was certainly clamouring for one but in that respect at least alwyn was stumped he knew what was happening but not why it was hap pening but he did nt care too much he was too busy missing meals losing pencils and running the local supermarket out of christmas puddings and they did nt care because it saved them having to put them away until the winter so everyone was happy as people should be in stories finally after week in which nothing had blown up burnt down or emitted nasty smells he decided to try the ultimate test he would go back through time this he had already decided was impossible if he was to go back in time it would set off all sorts of paradoxes and para doxes are impossible following such lines of reasoning he stood in the middle of cage now much larger than the original and flicked the switch fully confident that nothing would hap pen and fell gently half foot onto the banks of river he looked blearily around wondering if some strange trick of the light could make small dingy lab look like wide lively looking river in the distance two brown and white tricks of the light were happily chewing the cud and wondering if it would rain later he watched the play of the sun on the water as it glinted happily off little ripples casting dappled shadows onto the red and grey fish swimming happily up the river he dipped his hand into the cool water and drew it out wet the idea was beginning to dawn on him that maybe this was nt trick of the light but that it was all somehow real either that or he was hallucinating after the lab had blown up around him and he been hit on the head by some inclement piece of nondescript machinery seeing as he could never hope to notice the difference anyway he decided to treat everything as real including the beautiful girl who had just emerged from behind nearby willow tree clad in flowing white dress that offset her pale complexion and golden hair hello stranger she said shyly mirroring that classic line that has so oft been abused in cheap and tacky novels where do you hie from hi er hie alwyn stuttered somewhat put off at the sight of her he was nt used to things that didnt have bundles of wires disappearing into them to cut long and potentially tedious story shorter her name was elaine and through some mystical pro cess entirely hidden to the writer she had become smitten with the stranger standing there in confusion dressed in those strange clothes and later as they lay together in the shadow of tree the earth did move for them most beau tifully as one might expect in such an implausible tale eighteen thirty six was the year he arrived in sunny june sixth morning eleven months later alwyn and la belle elaine were gifted with the birth of beautiful son alwyn had long since resigned himself to the fact that he could nt go back and his lovely bride had never asked where he was from thus neatly avoiding any potentially awkward explanations they gave to their son the name peter doning ton peter because that was name they liked and doning ton because that happened to be alwyn family name even if had neglected to mention it earlier it was three weeks later when the rogue thought struck him tormenting him there was something he felt he really had to remember something about peter donington then it hit him his great great grandfather name waswould be peter and so this brings us rather neatly back to the beginning of this tale and explains paradoxically why the portrait of the aforementioned ancestor that hung in his parent living room was the spitting image of alwyn himself but they both lived happily ever after anyway so everything was alright copyright edwin hayward 14 may 1992 address
