prints of the city by daniel flower detective greg phillips looked at the body of the woman sprawled on the bedroom floor her nightgown was bunched around her waist and her panties were in tatters her face was battered and bruised his new partner jim omeara was busy being sick for the third time he wondered how someone so young could be assigned to homicide conveniently forgetting that he had only been two years older than omeara when he had been assigned to the squad the neighbors all claimed to have heard nothing out of the ordinary and reported seeing no strangers in the area evidently the victim only friend in the apartment building was jan owings the person who had discovered the body she had expected the victim to give her ride to work and when she had failed to show up at the appointed time owings had gone up to check on her the only bright spot in the investigation so far was the fact that the knife the murderer had used had been left at the scene with two clear latents on it phillips popped couple of antacid tablets as he watched the men from the coroner office load the body on the stretcher omeara walked back into the room his face pale and sweaty you gon na be all right kid phillips asked yes sir think so good hate to have to explain to the chief how could lose partner on his very first case by the way do nt call me sir it makes me feel old if you have to call me anything my first name is greg yes si mean greg what do we do now we go back to the squad room and fill out preliminary report then we look through the mo file to see if this is part of series tell me what you think happened here uh it looks like burglar entered the apartment found miss reese in bed had little fun with her and then killed her after that he took any valuables he could find and then left maybe but doubt it there no sign of forced entry and nothing of value appears to be missing there is also the evidence presented by the body do nt wait for the coroner to give you all the answers what was unique about the body do nt follow you what was missing that should have been there her jewelry no normally when person is being knifed he will hold his hands up in an attempt to fend off the blows this results in cuts to the hands and forearms reese was only stabbed in the chest there were no cuts on her arms she could have submitted timidly to rape if she saw weapon and she was scared enough but she would have tried to defend herself as soon as she realized what the killer intended to do the will to live is strong so what does that tell you that she knew who killed her possibly if that the case he set the scene up to look like this in an attempt to put us on the wrong trail did you notice any personal letters around here yeah her mail is over on the desk no the mail on her desk are bills and junk mail mean letters from friends and relatives did nt notice any does that mean anything it could most people keep personal letters around for awhile my wife still has every letter that wrote to her while was in the navy maybe reese was the type of person who threw personal letters away after she was through with them but it is something to keep in mind if she kept them somewhere and we should be able to find out from her friends if she did or not then they are missing maybe the murderer took them for some reason well enough gabbing let go to the squad room and get to work after spending an almost sleepless night detective phillips arrived at the squad room the next day bleary eyed omeara was all ready at his desk phillips briefly mourned his lost youth then poured himself cup of coffee morning greg have rough night yes did did you get in touch with miss owings yet omeara nodded and said she not going to work today and said we could stop by any time after ten okay any reports come in yet nope have nt seen any how far have you gotten this morning well ve looked through reese appointment book for the last six months and made list of the names that were in it the list is on your desk marked the names that showed up in her address book too good now tell me what we do next well we have to talk to the people she knew so we can find out why she was killed we have to find out were the people on that list work so we can talk to them okay who do we talk to first do nt know guess we start at the top and work our way down how can we do this without wasting lot of time do nt know we all ready know who her best friend is right yeah so we start with her since she wo nt be available until after ten we can go down to the lab and see if they have any preliminary findings for us after visiting the lab the two detectives drove to the apartment building and took the elevator up to owings floor phillips knocked on the door and heard muffled hold on sec after short wait the door opened to disclose bloodshot eyed jan owings with her blonde hair still wet from recent shower good morning detectives please come in thank you miss owings they walked into an apartment which with the exception of the furnishings was carbon copy of miss reese after entering the living room miss owings indicated the couch and said could get you gentlemen cup of coffee no thank you phillips said miss owings sat in an overstuffed chair and said hope you ll excuse my behavior yesterday ellen was one of my best friends we understand miss owings we like to ask you some questions now and some of them will be rather personal but we need the answers in order to catch the killer ll do my best detective phillips good that all we can ask for tell me how you happened to find miss reese yesterday morning well ellen was supposed to give me ride to work because my car is in the shop when she hadnt come down to get me by 830 went up to check on her when she did nt answer the door went in and found her like that what time was she supposed to come and get you eight oclock was her door locked oh no it was locked we each had keys to each other apartments hold on jim did you make note of the items in miss reese purse like asked you to sure did good how many keys did she have let me check omeara said as he flipped through his notebook set of car keys and the key to her apartment that it miss owings did miss reese carry your apartment key with her yes she did do you know where it is no do nt know she had it last sunday okay how long have you known miss reese for about eight years now we went to college together did she have steady boy friend no one you would really call steady she saw couple of guys off and on had miss reese been having any trouble with anyone she told me that mike had been pressuring her for awhile mike who mike townsend her exhusband she said that he wanted to give the relationship another try and would nt give up how long has she been divorced she left him about year and half ago if remember right do you know were he lives no but he owns small public relations firm downtown somewhere did she ever mention any threats that he might have made not to me she just said he was being pigheaded about getting back together with her is there anyone that you re aware of that wanted to harm her ca nt think of anyone she got along good with everybody she met ellen made friends easily do you know if miss reese had box or other container that she kept personal letters in no never saw one we have list here of people names we found in her address book would you look at it and tell us if she ever mentioned any of them he handed her the list and she looked at it for few moments she mentioned couple of these guys before think she dated them for awhile the first four women are coworkers but ca nt remember her mentioning anything about any of the others did miss reese ever mention having any fights or arguments with either of the two gentlemen on the list no she did nt talk about them whole lot do nt think the relationships were that serious did miss reese go out lot well ellen liked to party but she usually went out only on the weekends she go out during the week for special occasion did she have favorite club that she went to let see she liked the 2000 club and the galaxy but she was nt afraid to try something new well we ve taken enough of your time miss owings sure you like to rest after yesterdays ordeal if you think of anything that might help please do nt hesitate to call my numbers on the card gave you yesterday thank you detective phillips ll be sure to call if think of anything she walked the detectives to the door and let them out phillips heard the dead bolt slide home after the door had closed they rode in the elevator and walked to the car in silence after omeara slid behind the wheel phillips snapped his fingers and said lemons omeara looked at him and said do you feel all right greg was trying to figure out what that smell was it was hard to figure out with all that perfume she was wearing so what do we do next hot shot the obvious thing to do is to find mike townsend and question him but first we should try to find out if he got any kind of record if he does his prints can be compared to those found of the knife if they match we ll save ourselves trip you re beginning to sound like detective except the first thing we re going to do is get something to eat you like chinese uhhuh good know just the place take the next right by the way you re buying after eating lunch they went back to the squad room the preliminary lab results were waiting for them on phillips desk he started to read through it while omeara went to check on townsend record omeara came back to the squad room thirty minutes later and sat at his desk well this case is solved townsend was picked up once for dui and we have his prints on file they match the ones found on the knife before you close the case would suggest you read paragraph three on page two omeara took the report and read the indicated section he frowned and said what does this mean prints found on weapon are suspect as to origin ridge pattern detail is weak and lacking in sweat pore detail adhesive residue was present around both prints found on the weapon was hoping you would know without going into great detail it is possible to transfer intact undeveloped latent prints from one smooth surface to another what that report is saying is that is strong possibility in this case oh so were does that leave us do nt know yet the report also says that three different sets of latents were lifted from the bedroom one set belongs to miss reese one matches the latents found on the knife and the third set is unidentified at this time another thing remember those blonde hairs found on the pillow and in the bed yeah what about them the lab says they came from the head and genital area of female what do we do now talk to townsend and see what he has to say the detectives found townsend office with ease but were told that he was at lunch with client and would be back shortly shortly turned out to be thirtyfive minutes when townsend walked in phillips intercepted him before he reached his secretarys desk excuse me mike townsend yes he extended his shield and said my name is detective phillips and this is my partner detective omeara we would like to ask you some questions about your exwife ellen reese certainly come on in to my office cheryl hold all of my calls for me yes sir his secretary said townsend preceded the detectives into the office and walked across to his desk have seat gentlemen ve been expecting you why that mr townsend is nt it normal to question the exhusband of woman who is murdered was beginning to wonder whether or not should come down to headquarters why did nt you because my business comes first detective phillips figured that you would find me if you needed me after all not common criminal on the run in that case would you mind telling me why your fingerprints were found on the weapon that was used to kill your exwife townsend blinked and stared at phillips busy man detective do nt have the time to waste listening to crude jokes oh am quite serious we pulled your prints from the file and they match well if that the case ll answer no more questions until my lawyer is present why is that mr townsend do you have something to hide that is question detective phillips if you want it answered you ll have to take me down to headquarters and wait until my attorney is present until then mum the word phillips sighed and said have it your way mr townsend read him his rights jim they waited for townsend lawyer for thirty minutes and then another twenty while client and counsel conferred in the interrogation room when the attorney indicated that he and his client were ready the detectives entered the room phillips identified himself to the attorney and said has your client briefed you on the situation yes he has wish it noted that he will freely answer any questions very well do you object to stenographer being present under the circumstances believe stenographer is advisable go get the steno jim he turned back to the attorney and asked would you or your client care for anything before we get started no thank you five minutes later omeara reentered the room with the stenographer after they all got settled phillips said mr townsend it is my duty to inform you for the record that you have the right to remain silent if you give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in court of law you have exercised your right to have an attorney present during this interrogation you may stop this proceeding at any time by so indicating your desire to me at that point you will or will not as the situation warrants be placed in custody do you have any questions no do you understand your rights as have explained them to you yes understand them good mr townsend ask you again do you feel like you need an attorney present because you have something to hide townsend attorney said hold on detective phillips my client has exercised his right to have an attorney present during questioning his reasons for doing so are immaterial to your investigation want that last question struck from the record go ahead and leave that last question out officer mr townsend can you explain why your fingerprints were found on the weapon that killed your exwife no ca nt all know is that did nt kill her where were you on tuesday night between the hours of 630 and 930 was with client may we have the client name please would like to withhold her name at present if need an alibi for anything will provide it am paid to bring good publicity to people not bad what was your relationship with your exwife saw her occasionally we were still friends did you want to get back together with her yes never thought we tried all that hard the first time did you ever use threats as means of getting her back no when was the last time you saw your exwife mr townsend took her to dinner sunday night to help celebrate her birthday and what did you do after dinner we went back to her apartment for couple of drinks did you go to bed with her that none of your damn business let me rephrase the question did you at any time during the course of the evening have cause to enter miss reese bedroom do nt see what that has to do with anything it has quite lot to do with this case and must insist on an answer otherwise will have to hold you as material witness yes did go to bed with her do you know jan owings yes she ellens best friend in way she was responsible for our divorce why do you say that she talked ellen into it or at least planted the idea in her head she some kind of female activist how long did your exwife know miss owings do nt know guess seven or eight years do you know where they met no do nt did your exwife keep personal letters she had received in box or something similar yes believe she did do nt know if she did after she left me do you know anyone who would want your exwife dead the door to the interrogation room opened and uniformed officer stuck his head in the room excuse me detective phillips you have call on line two from the coroner office they said it important if you gentlemen will excuse me the group waited in uncomfortable silence for ten minutes when phillips returned he said mr townsend evidence has been uncovered that removes you for the time being as suspect would like to ask you couple more questions if you dont mind what evidence not at liberty to say go ahead thank you do you know if your exwife was in the habit of going out frequently as far as know she only went out on weekends do you know anything about any boyfriends that she may have had no never discussed that with her okay thank you for your cooperation mr townsend regret any inconvenience this may have caused you ll forgive you if you catch ellen murderer you ve got deal after the detectives were back at their desk omeara said okay greg what did the coroner say well it seems we do nt have the murder weapon after all what that right the coroner ran every test he could the knife found at the scene is similar to the one that caused the wounds but there are enough differences to rule it out as the murder weapon why did the murderer even bother to leave weapon at the scene in order to frame townsend which seems to be the only explanation for it weapon found at the scene with his prints on it would be convincing to any jury in the country the murderer did nt want to mess the transferred prints up so he used different knife to commit the crime guess he did nt know that knife wound could be matched to the knife that caused it with so much accuracy then we re back to the beginning no we are nt that far behind the eight ball we ll find out tomorrow phillips did nt make it in until nine oclock the next morning omeara was waiting for him its about time you showed up what our next step calm down mom have to make phone call before we decide thought of something last night that want to check on he sat down at his desk and after referring to number in his notebook picked up the phone and dialed local number mr townsend please detective phillips yes ll hold omeara started to say something but phillips cut him off by raising his hand good morning mr townsend this is detective phillips no we have nt solved the case yet ve got another question for you if you dont mind no can ask it on the phone what college did your exwife attend uhhuh good and do you know what she studied what about miss owings do you know what she studied see thank you mr townsend you ve been most helpful what he say you sure are impatient today jim if youre not careful you ll end up with an ulcer like me he said they both went to montrose college over on third street according to him miss owings minored in criminology do you get the picture now think beginning to let me see if ive got it right go for it okay we know that miss reese knew her killer or at least it is highly likely she did blonde hair was found on the pillow and in the bed and an un identified set of prints was found in the bedroom the knife at the scene had latent prints on it that were forged box of letters might be missing but we ca nt be sure again it is good possibility miss owings has background in criminology it can be supposed that she has the knowledge needed to transfer fingerprints would say we should check miss owings fingerprints against the unidentified set one will get you ten they match say they ll match too let go get search warrant they finally got the warrant after waiting for an hour as they got in the car omeara said why did nt we get an arrest warrant too we do nt have all the evidence we need yet search warrant will do the job for now still say we should arrest her okay hotshot when you re in charge you can now let go search that apartment they stopped outside owings apartment and omeara knocked on the door he was ready to knock again when muffled voice said who is it detectives omeara and phillips miss owings we have some more questions for you she opened the door and said please come in omeara said miss owings we have warrant to search these premises for evidence in connection with the murder of ellen reese owings mouth opened and closed number of times my apartment why would you want to search my apartment omeara shrugged his shoulders and said all the evidence points to you miss owings if you will accompany us throughout the search please where do we start greg in the bedroom the trio walked down the hallway to the bedroom miss owings sandwiched between the two detectives phillips said search the closet first jim ill watch miss owings omeara opened the closet door and pushed the clothes aside numerous boxes were stacked on the floor he started to go through them being careful not to disturb any useful prints after twenty minute search he found what they were looking for the box was full of letters and bloody knife lay on top jan owings fainted phillips carried the box to the car and omeara walked behind him his face dark with rage he got in the passenger seat and said still do nt see why we did nt take her into custody now she gon na hightail it she not going anywhere jim you heard what she said and saw how she reacted to the box do you really think she did it yes think she deserves an oscar for that performance ve been in this business for awhile now id stake my career on the fact that she innocent of murder if you calmed down for few minutes you might be able to figure it out where are we going now to pick up the murderer of ellen reese when he stopped the car in front of the townsend public relations office building omeara looked at him is this your idea of joke no just listen and learn phillips rushed past the secretary desk and threw townsend door open townsend stood up and said what is the meaning of this mr townsend how long did you know that your exwife was having an affair with jan owings townsend face muscles tightened and he said you re crazy do nt know what you re talking about yes you do know that you killed your exwife and tried to frame miss owings for it you made me suspicious when you were able to tell me what college owings went to and what she minored in why would you need to know that after eight years you re talking out your ass detective phillips there is nothing to connect me with the murder of ellen that what you hope mr townsend well get you even if we do nt get your prints off the box of letters you planted in owings apartment did you get rid of owings apartment key that you took from your exwife purse you can be sure that you left trail and with you in custody as material witness we will find it want my attorney bet you do mr townsend just bet you do read him his rights jim the detectives were sitting in the squad room sipping coffee omeara said still do nt get it what motive did he have he wanted to get back together with miss reese more than anything we ll never know for sure because do nt think he ll talk but suspect that she finally told him that there was no possible way for reconciliation she found someone that cared for her as he never had and she was nt going to go back to him guess he figured if he could nt have her no one could do nt think he had an alibi for that night either he knew that the differences in the knives would be spotted and he gave us that client bit as stall why did he try to frame miss owings he wanted to ruin her life like she ruined his she was who reese left him for
