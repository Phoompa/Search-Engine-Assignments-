such comments are invited the hunter the hunted by daniel flower he ran through the woods branches slapping at his face sweat poured out of his body like flooding river his heart beat thundered in his ears this ca nt be happening he thought but it was his pursuer seemed happy to pace him the distance between them remained constant he jumped over dead fall and lost his balance for heart rending second then he righted himself and continued the woods which had seemed so friendly and familiar just thirty minutes before were strange and sinister the trees and undergrowth conspired against him tripping him teasing him laughing at him he wanted to rest to give up and let what happened happen there was stream up ahead he could hear it he headed in that direction at least the water would cool him for short while he caromed off of tree and lost his footing completely how easy it would be to lay here and let it finish giving up was not part of his nature he got to his feet and started moving again he could see the stream through the trees now just little further his muscles moved like lead the pain had disappeared long ago he braced himself against tree on the stream bank and listened for his pursuer yes still there moving steadily and in no hurry moving towards him he took quick drink of the cool water and then crashed through the stream the water that splashed onto his body was refreshing he wanted to lay down in it rehabilitating coolness but to do so was death he climbed the opposite bank and continued his flight sound up ahead froze him in his tracks more then one in front and behind trapped unable to continue the will to live just spark in his chest enough of spark to go on to live he started running again paralleling the stream the going was too rough along the stream bank too much undergrowth trees too close together find the path of least resistance find the path to freedom and life shot rings through the woods reverberates from the mountains the bullet removes bark and wood from tree by his head close so close too close jump another dead fall not feeling moving by instinct get away another shot burning fire in his leg mind blocks out the pain have to survive blood pours must rest need help someone anyone help stumbles almost falls keep going another shot closer bark stings his eyes slowing down still ca nt see his pursuers wo nt even know what his killers look like ca nt find out why why me ve never hurt anyone run escape ca nt outrun bullets senses this truth almost gives up no wo nt give up another shot rings out he goes down pain in chest this is it dieing now the sweat on his body has turned to foam his legs keep moving for even in death there is life the legs slow down eyes close against the pain feels the warm sticky blood on his chest not long now almost over the life runs out legs twitch spasmodically one last time the last unheard thought courses through his brain why willy cranshaw wakes with start his bed sheets are crumpled into ball his mattress is soaked as is his body he reaches with shaking hands for cigarette another nightmare third one this week gets out of bed and walks to the kitchen removes beer from the refrigerator and sits at the table wipes his face with towel what does it mean he wonders each dream has gotten worse he had escaped in the first two dreams he does remember being shot at in the second dream but whoever was shooting had missed he took long pull from the beer it has to mean something everything has purpose even if man does nt always understand all he knew for sure was that he had never had dream like these before maybe going crazy he thought should bring this up with my analyst during our next session he finishes the beer and goes back to bed no use crying over spilled milk he thinks another hunting accident sheriff deputy jim marshall asks looks that way sheriff bob russell said that the only thing can figure one shot to the head no sign of anyone else brush is nt too thick though whoever shot him must have had good look at him unless he was hit by stray bullet we ll do the usual check on him but have feeling it will be as inconclusive as all the others okay ll start checking around see if can find anything do you want to tell his wife jim said no not really but guess have to you go ahead with the background check while do that they both jumped when they heard someone coming through the woods sheriff russell relaxed when he saw who it was you sure did nt waste any time mike how life he said ca nt complain bob sally got hold of me before went back to town figured should swing by while was out here anyway got another accident on your hands mike howard ace reporter from the addison county free press said yeah it sure looks that way the deceased is ned williams age 42 from cornwall estimated time of death was around eight this morning he was discovered by john fields from middlebury at two this afternoon apparently died from rifle shot to the head the next of kin has nt been notified yet so hold off on printing his name until clear it okay sure no problem is this one the same as the others it appears that way we ll do the normal checks but would nt hold my breath for any new developements that off the record too by the way any signs of anyone else no not yet deputy ames is looking right now this is the fifth death since the season opened sheriff certainly you can come up with something so far there are no indications that any of those deaths are related and until find evidence to the contrary have to log them as hunting accidents we re still waiting on the ballistics reports from the state police until we get those in we re at stand still what would you advise other hunters to do in the mean time make sure of what they are shooting at and make sure that they are visible to other hunters anything else no not right now if anything comes up you ll be the first to know have to go now you can hang around here with deputy marshall until the coroner shows up okay thanks for the info sheriff russell hiked the half mile back to the truck lost in thought the first of the ballistics reports should be arriving today from burlington he knew deep in his heart what they would say remington 3006 270 grain fired from the same weapon he got in his truck and picked up his microphone dispatch this is the sheriff over this is dispatch go ahead sheriff need the address for ned williams he lived in cornwall somewhere okay will do oh sheriff three of those ballistics reports came in today on my way the sound of shot rang through the woods brief flare of pain arced across his back he smelled fear in the air his own run he dodged trees and branches have to get away ca nt let them get me sweat stung the wound on his back stung his eyes breath coming in short gasps heart pounding in his ears help me someone help me why another shot dodge to the left swerve to avoid tree clearing ahead pick up speed no trees to worry about no branches almost through the clearing have to make it the next shot punches through his chest rips open the lung he falls got to run gets up stumbles recovers body laced with pain so much pain another shot he does nt hear it bullet severs the spinal cord at the neck collapses lays twitching on the ground help me damn knew it sheriff russell says what that sheriff asks deputy ames according to ballistics the bullets in the first three cases came from the same gun the logical conclusion is that all of the killings are related our jobs just got harder unless we want to acknowledge the fact that someone is hunting hunters what the connection all of these men have different back grounds and everything sheriff know know damn get me mike howard on the phone he fiddled with pen as deputy ames dialed the burning in his stomach increased he popped couple of antacid tablets as deputy ames handed him the phone hello mike ve got statement to make are you ready go ahead bob it now appears that the five hunting deaths that have occurred during the last week are related the only connection that is evident at this point in time is that all of the men were hunters would strongly encourage all hunters to buddy up from now until this case is solved anyone noticing anything unusual is asked to contact the sheriff office immediately whew thanks bob ll get this out as soon as can he said as he hung up get the radio stations on the horn ames and tell them the same thing ask them to get it on the air as soon as possible right sheriff he senses their presence in the woods they are close he has to fight the impulse to take flight stay here they wo nt find me do nt move someone help me he catches sight of the man through the undergrowth were he hides he is carrying stick in his hands searching looking for me walking right towards me muscles tense ready to run his fear is intense why why do they do this he watches nerves and instincts screaming run but he does nt not yet there is another one he senses where must know where twig snaps off to the left there another carrying stick too the first man raises his hand in greeting the deer watches as the second man raises his stick to his shoulder fire smoke and noise come from the end of the stick the deer bolts must escape the first man head explodes he lies quivering on the forest floor the second man watches the deer bound through the woods go my friend you are safe now sheriff russell looks at the body number six he thinks where will it end he looks at the hunter friend he is in shock unable to grasp what has happened here today he is no help heard shot and thought his friend had bagged deer found his friend quivering on the ground instead at least this time they had witness if you could call him that they had confiscated the hunters gun it was 3006 popular gun in these parts the sheriff doubted if anything would come of it at least this time there would be less of the woods to search the murderer must have left the scene going away from the hunters friend the two deputies were busy searching that area now the odds were that they would find something that would point to the killer eventually sheriff russell hated playing the odds more hunters would die before they could do anything to stop this maniac hey sheriff deputy ames yelled think we found something sheriff russell ran over to where ames was searching what have you got he said boot print they studied it together the sheriff noticed two things about the print one it was popular brand sold by bean two it had chunk missing from the left side of the sole way to go ames he said just earned yourself an extra day off get the plaster kit from the truck well my friend we re closing in sooner or later you re going to make mistake and then you ll be ours willy cranshaw whistled as he drove home from work the dreams were still there but he did nt worry about them anymore they had become his friends and as friends he welcomed them every night he was glad that tomorrow was his day off time to do some relaxing he thought he worked too hard but someone had to pay the bills maybe he do little hunting tomorrow the hunters moved cautiously through the woods only week left in the season and none of them had bagged deer yet with work and everything else they might be able to get two more full days of hunting in the three of them were separated by seventyfive yards they seen lot of deer sign but so far today no deer john hanson was ready to shoot his first deer although he was twentythree years old this was only his second season his parents had never allowed him to hunt when he was teenager so he was trying to make up for lost time he gotten couple shots off earlier in the season but his aim was nt that good that he should get some target practice in before the season started never occurred to him he scanned the woods in front of him choosing his steps carefully he saw flash of international orange in the bushes off to his left about eighty yards ahead lot of hunters out he thought he looked to his left and saw charlie sole he couldnt see harry charlie brother though he looked towards the other hunter he saw him aiming in charlie direction john tried to see what the other hunter was aiming at the report from the rifle startled him he had scanned the woods and the only thing he saw was charlie he saw charlie jump and then fall forward john looked back to the unknown hunter and saw that he was moving away from them john did nt think about what he did next he braced himself against tree and took aim at the other hunter head he braced himself against the kick of the rifle and pulled the trigger sheriff russell stared at john hanson so you do nt know if you hit him or not he said no do nt thought saw him jump but not sure im not the greatest shot in the world so probably missed him did you recognize him did nt see him that close all noticed was that he seemed to be lanky average height it looked like he was wearing an international orange vest and hat that all saw before he disappeared into the woods okay want you to meet me at the office in about an hour the sheriff walked towards deputy ames he was getting tired of pulling hunter bodies out of the woods find anything yet ames he called yeah sheriff he was hit got some fresh blood here on some bushes looks like he hurt bad ought to get the dogs out here see if we can track this guy down right get the samples ll call for the dogs deputy marshall showed up twenty minutes later with the dogs by that time the coroner had removed the body another head shot guy knew how to shoot that for sure the three men set off on the trail for someone who was wounded this guy sure does nt take it easy thought the sheriff they twisted and turned through the woods the dogs had nt been necessary so far the guy was losing lot of blood they finally found him mile from the scene of the shooting he was laying face down on the forest floor his back covered with blood the sheriff carefully picked the rifle up remington 3006 they turned him over and searched for an id says here his name is william cranshaw from east middlebury either of you guys know him the sheriff asked both of the deputies shook their heads the sheriff checked the guys boots one of them had deep gouge missing from the left side of the sole well looks like we got our man fellas ballistics will be able to confirm it wonder why he did it the deer ran through the woods ignoring the pain of the slapping branches his heart thundered in his rib cage got to get away he sensed the presence of his pursuer still there leave me alone ve done nothing wrong he jumped dead fall and swerved to the right to avoid the tree sweat soaked his body spittle flew from his mouth need to rest ca nt rest must run survive he senses the presence of the stream cool water need to drink he pauses at the stream bank listening still there closing in takes quick drink of the cool water continue he runs through the water little bit refreshed rest must rest cant rest why why is he chasing me get away the shot reverberates through the woods fear increases help me someone help me please keep going life the second shot hits his right ear tears it from his head pain red hot shearing unrelenting ca nt stop ca nt slow down run the third shot enters between the fifth and sixth ribs rips through the lung enters the heart the big heart stops beating in protest to this unholy intrusion into it domain he falls in tangle of feet and lays twitching on the forest floor help me sam dimick sits up with start his body is covered with cold sweat his bed is mess of bunched up sheets and blankets what nightmare he thinks whew he gets up and stretches his aching muscles why is he so sore especially his ear and his chest the last time he felt pain like this was when he broke his leg when he was twelve he goes to the bathroom and wets wash cloth with cold water oooh that nice he thinks as he rubs the wash cloth over his face he takes the aspirin bottle from the medicine chest and takes four of them with two glasses of water if this pain keeps up im gon na have to go see the doc he thinks probably just pulled muscle during that nightmare he straightens the bed up and lays down everything will look better tomorrow he sure copyright 1987 by
