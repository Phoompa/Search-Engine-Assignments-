dream school chapter one early years first choices jon was three now so it was time to find the best possible prekindergarten for him his parents eldon and marie were both very well educated successful and brilliant they insisted on the best for jons education the montesorri school downtown was the logical choice so they started there friendly young woman interviewed them and gave them the usual sales pitch after only few dozen questions and large down payment they enrolled him for the fall semester as an afterthought the young woman told his parents about new school just outside the city it called the dream school and it really is an entirely new type of school it does nt compete directly with the montesorritype schools either in schedule or subject matter the hours are entirely at night one night week all night long the subject matter is the lessons of life or what we can learn from our interactions with other living things the format fascinated them so the new school was their next stop it was located in sedate neighborhood mostly older homes with few quiet businesses here and there nothing really stood out about the new school visually it was in rather plain office building with no signs or other outward indicator that it was school first contact they were greeted at the door and taken into small interview room by marla professionally dressed young woman she gave jon some toys to occupy him in one corner while the adults talked dream school was founded in september of 2513 almost year ago she began my husband aaron and started it with the help of some colleagues from city university we did experiments on our basic concept over the past ten years so we thought it was time to put it all together and see if it would fly to shorten long story it does now what would you like to know first why the odd hours and how does it work asked jon the hours are for secrecy actually for reasons which will explain shortly we do nt want the children to be aware of their presence in our school to achieve that we ask the parents to wait until the children have fallen asleep naturally and then spray mild sedative into their nostrils after few minutes the child can safely be brought here without waking him or her we then administer neurorelaxer which keeps the child in state similar to hypnosis neither completely asleep nor awake he will be in an inbetween state where his awareness is in the region commonly called the subconscious mind the child will remain in this state for about six hours depending on his age and physical condition during this time he will actively engage in our learning process after that he will be sedated again and return home since he wo nt get his normal rem and deep sleep that night we limit his dream school to one night week your second question will require bit more detail to answer our concept begins with safety first and foremost we constantly monitor all his vital signs both by machine and live personnel the room in which he will experience our process is completely childproof as far as is possible to make it all walls and floors are padded as well as other fixtures and furniture there will be qualified medical personnel and facilities always present of course these are standard procedures for such process as ours but we do nt stop there we also monitor his emotional state electronically and stop any interaction which is excessively stressful and that brings us to the heart of the matter our process as you have heard we teach the same lessons everyone learns in life by dealing with pain stress pleasure guilt and the whole range of emotions here he will learn not only how to handle emotions and to interact with other living things but also about himself so why you may ask does he need school to learn the lessons of life he does nt need it to learn the lessons he needs it to learn the lessons sooner and safer would nt it be wonderful for example to know that he had learned not to run into busy street without any risk while learning that he had learned not to pick up poisonous reptile without having to risk fatal bite and in addition to safety issues how about social skills suppose he learned not to hit smaller children without getting the reputation of bully or not to lie to everyone without making permanent habit of it and suppose he learned to respect that people are different from but not inferior to him without first becoming racist and last suppose he learns why he has annoying counter productive habits that make him unpopular before he becomes an outcast now you have the basic concept for our school all that remains is to explain the process by which we achieve our concept this is where it gets little technical but with your backgrounds think you can keep up the neurorelaxer we use does not interfere with the normal senses of the brain what it does instead is allow us to add to the normal senses an extra perception of objects and living creatures that our computer creates these extrasensory sensations enter the consciousness of the student through microscopic receivers surgically placed under his scalp the computer transmits radiowave signals to these devices they then send small electrical pulses to the appropriate brain area for that sensory input in effect the student sees hears smells and feels the imaginary objects and living creatures created by our computer our computer has memories not only of millions of objects and people but also billions of reactions to specific actions the student might take for example suppose your son was talking to computergenerated friend composite of thousands of real children whose reactions were on record and then suppose for no reason other than curiosity he hit this friend the computer would instantly choose the reaction which was most appropriate to the situation so the imaginary child might cry and run away or it might knock your son on his backside the blow to your child face would be imaginary and do no physical harm he would perceive it as real however and fall on his behind on the padded floor and the pain would be real but temporary do you follow me so far two heads nodded up and down in unison there is really no way to predict how your son will react to his encounters here just as there is no way to predict his reactions in real life and as in real life some people just learn faster and better than others and some will use these experiences to become more kind and just to other living creatures others will use them to learn how to gain advantage over their fellow lifeforms and to seek out all available pleasures in that respect what we mainly do is to accelerate the process by which the child becomes what the child has the potential to become however for any parents who desire help we have behaviour modification program which is skinnerian in design in close consultation with the parents we can program the computer to stimulate discomfort centers of the brain when the child acts inappropriately and comfort centers when reward is indicated we ll keep you fully informed of his actions and reactions in our sessions and we encourage you to take whatever corrective measures at home which you feel appropriate just connect your corrections to his real life actions because he wo nt recall any events from our sessions while he is in his normal conscious state first questions so you offer intervention or nonintervention what data do you have on the results of your process so far marie inquired the best data we have is the parents opinions our subject matter quite frankly is still the subject of much debate in the academic community we ll open our books to you and you can interview whomever you care to how many students do you have inquired eldon currently we have seven hundred seventyfive percent are from the city and twenty percent are from your area you could start interviewing from that list if you wish my only request is that you maintain the confidentiality principle when you are around their children understood how do you get so many students into this building it might be easier to show you would you care to take the short tour ok we have eleven floors in this building the first floor is administrative and technical support area all the other floors are identical pick number from two to eleven six follow me first sight the elevator door opened on the sixth floor to reveal long hallway with hallways leading off to the right and left straight ahead please the hallway then led to circular room with ten doors arranged evenly around the curved walls each door had large window with oneway glass in the center of the room there was three sided console with small desk area and monitor on each side at the front edge of each desk stood small microphone on flexible stalk each desk had comfortablelooking office chair under it this is our monitoring room for the floor each door is an emergency entrance and visual monitoring gate to room we always have three people here when students are present and they are qualified in emergency medical procedures the desks are electronic monitoring stations and each desk monitors all ten rooms the programs for the students run from the first floor main computer and that is also where our resident physician is stationed each room is accessible from the outside of the circle the child is brought in through the door from the outside hallway and the inside door remains closed except for emergencies as you can see the rooms are quite drab to give the extrasensory images less competition so you have ten floors with ten rooms each said marie that one hundred times seven nights or seven hundred so you are full now right right and there is waiting list but the list moves fairly quickly and think we would be able to enroll jon in month or two why does the list move quickly eldon inquired for financial reasons mostly what financial reasons asked eldon with mild apprehension we try to be fair about our tuition but we do have very expensive process here our solution is to ask for percentage of the gross income of the parents the rate is indexed to your income and increases to maximum of five percent for the highest bracket which bracket are you in ten million year combined replied eldon the rate for your level is two percent so that would be sixteen thousand six hundred and sixtysix dollars and sixtysix cents per month of attendance marla informed them without breaking eye contact is that too steep for you not if you can do what you say you can replied eldon we ll do some interviews with the parents on your list for our area and get back to you said marie fine replied marla and we can put jon on the list as tentative entrant with no obligation to you except to have an answer for us when his name comes up thanks that sounds fine said eldon first research three weeks later eldon and marie had interviewed fifteen couples in their neighborhood about the new school twelve had nothing but praise two were noncommittal and one wanted their money back eldon tried to explain that he had no connection to the management of dream school the elderly couple was adamant however that he should do something about their complaint he promised that he would look into it two more weeks passed before the call came from dream school what have you decided oh we want to enroll jon right away in the intervention program replied marie and eldon has question for you eldon was assured that the elderly couple had not been promised that their granddaughter would make better grades in kindergarten because of dream school everything was in place now for jon to begin on friday new students were started on friday or saturday until their reaction to sleep deprivation was evaluated marla told them jon fell asleep early friday night chapter first awakenings first suspicions jon was twelve now and doing just fine in the sixth grade he had friend named eric and they did almost everything together and so it was that one bright winter morning the two boys walked to school together aaachooo went eric could nt be allergies this time of year said jon you must have the yellow death or something yea guess so mom sprayed something in my nose last night but guess it was nt enough mom sprays my nose sometimes too do nt know what in it for sure but it puts me right to sleep if awake asked mom about it once and she said it was to keep me from having bad dreams but still have them anyway really my mom said it was to keep little bugs out of my nose while sleep but think that was like the tooth fairy story or maybe it just not the same stuff you get maybe not why do nt you see if you can find it and bring it to school saw the little bottle mine comes in and can tell if it the same you bring yours too if they are the same somebody at school might know what it is ok on the way to school the next morning two identical bottles are produced from two little pockets hey these are the same said jon they ca nt be for both bugs and bad dreams somebody has been pulling our chains yeah let take them to the nurse and ask her about them she know for sure well let see now said nurse roydon it says in the fine print here return to ds corporation if found it has phone number and post office box number that about all can make out on it that makes any sense just where did you boys get this anyway two little heads went blank if they said they found it the nurse would call the phone number if they said it belonged to one of their parents she want to know why they had brought it to her it my allergy medicine said eric after pause just wondered if you could tell us what was in it why in the world would you want to know that eric eyes stared into space his mouth partly open it for science project declared jon we re supposed to find out about chemicals we come in contact with every day then we re supposed to do report on each one yeah said eric nurse roydon stared at them for moment like skeptical buyer at horse auction whose science class are you two in total silence you do nt know total silence with heads dropped let go talk to principal newcomb good morning miss roydon said the tall menacing figure in the main office good morning sir have two mutes here and very mysterious little bottle traumatic loss of voice suppose said the tall man as he stared down at the two silent boys yes sir think so replied the nurse with little grin and here is the mystery bottle they brought me not much information on it remarked the principal what is this boys allergy medicine sir replied eric in subdued voice well that seems plausible what wrong with this picture miss roydon it the cock and bull story that goes with it sir it seems that they have science project that involves this bottle but they ca nt remember who their science teacher is well now that easy enough these two are nt taking science this year two little heads drooped even lower ll bet their parents could help us straighten this out real quick said the tall man we re not supposed to have it declared jon softly and you re not supposed to tell whoppers either added nurse roydon and so ended their first attempt to solve the mystery of the little bottles their curiosity would not be held at bay for long though they had already discovered that their mothers had given them conflicting information about the bottles and that genie could nt be put back in the bottle second suspicions mom eric mom uses the same spray on him and she says it to prevent nightmares said jon how can it do that and keep bugs out too two ingredients maybe oh that seemed to satisfy him for few minutes then another doubt plagued him why does nt it have the name of the medicine on it like other medicine bottles for privacy jon you do nt want other people to know that you have nightmares do you guess not jon was learning the art of adlib from the master he would accept her revised explanation for few more months cthird suspicions then came summer and jon and eric were off to camp hey eric hear there are lot of bugs around here did you bring that spray bottle no mom did nt pack it how about you nope guess ll be too busy for nightmares here oh here some insect stuff guess this is supposed to do the same thing said eric you going to spray that stuff up your nose asked jon nah this stuff is in rubon stick wonder why mom does nt use this stuff at home beats me wonder why mom did nt think have any nightmares here did you ever hear of that ds corporation anywhere nope maybe we ought to call that phone number on the bottles and see what it is here dollar you dial and ll talk good morning this is the ds corporation if you have found one of our medicine bottles please press one if you need information press two beep this is chris how may help you what kind of place is this it medicine factory we make nasal sprays with all kinds of medications in them your doctor tells us what to put in it for you and we send it to him would you like to order some nasal sprays no thanks was just curious click eric relayed the conversation to jon and they sifted through the details still think they are shucking us said jon it just does nt add up yeah know but how are we going to get some answers there no way for us to find out what really in those bottles without our folks finding out first maybe there is suppose that medicine in those little bottles was replaced by just plain water then whatever it was supposed to do wouldnt happen if started to have bunch of nightmares or you got bugs in your nose we know they were telling us the truth if something else happened then we know what it was really for excellent plan jon when are you going to do it we re both going to do it eric just as soon as we get home and so the great plan was carried out the great plan fifteen minutes after his nose was sprayed with water jon heard voices is it time yes it been fifteen minutes there comes the transport now jon did his best sleeping imitation upon his arrival at dream school he was given the usual neurorelaxer spray jon went off to dreamland what happened to you eric asked jon you look like you ve seen ghost jon carefully related all the details of his abduction the previous night right up to ten minutes after his second nasal spray at which time his memory stopped what about you asked jon nah usually get mine tomorrow night ll let you know try to notice where you are lost track and think they had the windows covered if you can memorize the turns you make what am going to do if they give me squirt in the nose at that place like they did you you ll go to sleep believe sure enough when the boys compared notes two days later their experiences had been identical but eric had managed to memorize the turns starts and stops of his trip the following saturday the boys set out to find their tormentors they found the neighborhood all right but then they were stumped there was no ds corporation in sight and they had neglected to get street address now what queried eric simple replied jon what time do you have to be home midnight told them was going to concert excellent here the plan we know what the transports look like right so we hang out here few hours and wait for one of them to come along then we follow it right brilliant actually it was fairly good plan and it worked by half past ten the boys were at the ds building how are we going to get in asked slightly nervous eric we re not at least not yet look for dumpster what for my dad says you are known by your trash what that mean did nt you ever watch detective show that how they catch lot of bad guys they search through their trash to find out what they ve been up to then they use it in court as evidence after an hour of searching through old business papers lunch scraps and dirty paper towels they gave up as they left the dumpster jon noticed small plastic bottle since they were close to curfew he stuffed it in his pocket for later inspection riding home on the bus the young adventurers examined their discovery this little bottle has label said eric excitedly yes but it empty and we ca nt even pronounce the words on this label much less know what it for well sure not going to take it to school that for certain said eric with determination right said jon with little grin this time we re going to be little more careful who do we know that we can trust have cousin who takes graduate courses in chemistry perfect chapter the big discovery the accomplice hey rasheed how ya doin cuz great are you still majoring in chemistry biochemistry actually working on graduate degree in biochemical engineering why thought maybe you could tell me what was in this bottle said eric as he handed rasheed the small plastic discovery from the dumpster rasheed quickly produced magnifying glass from his pocket and examined the object where did you get this asked rasheed in demanding voice momentarily eric thought he was back in nurse roydon office we found it he managed to say who we and where did you find it me and jon uh that is jon and me jon and yeah anyway we found it in dumpster behind place they call ds corporation oh yeah ve heard of that place what were you doing there some kid we know goes there we think we were just wondering what they gave him to keep him from remembering what happens to him this could be it all right it powerful drug which can put you into semihypnotic state you would nt recall anything that happened while you were under so what could this kid do about it say if he did nt like what they were doing to him well he could stay awake one time guess that way he could see for himself what was going on but how you said yourself that powerful stuff yea that true but everything has it antidote even if it hasnt been found yet for this particular drug there is well known antidote commonly available by prescription how am going to get some of that you re not probably but tell me something squirt what is this friend name very informative silence followed would it be jon or eric eric figured he had nothing to lose since he could go no further by himself yeah both he confessed thought so suppose really should ask your parents before going any further with this yeah that what everybody else does said eric with sigh hey they re pretty neat people said rasheed think they will give you fair shake could nt we just drop the whole thing sure no harm done so far but what would you do about the great mystery hey like to know myself you re right one way or another ve got to know so let go and talk to your parents the confrontation eric parents max and jinny were calm about the whole thing they suggested that they all go and see jon and his parents the four of them proceeded to eldon and marie house it looks like the jig is up jinny said to marie what do we do now let call marla at the school eldon suggested marla did not seem surprised that it had happened we have already had some of the older children catch on she told them why do nt all of you come down and we ll talk about your options so everyone except rasheed proceeded to dream school we ll fill you in later they assured him the big secret revealed at the school marla proceeded to give jon and eric the same history purpose and procedure lecture she had given eldon and marie years earlier then they all toured floor together wow was all jon and eric could say marla even demonstrated the imaging and other extrasensory projection functions of the rooms to jon and eric fully awake awesome remarked eric as jon nodded his head now that you understand what has happened to you here there is no further use for pretense marla told them but there are now some new possibilities during the past eight years we have developed what we refer to as postawareness curriculum it will be up to your parents and you whether you want to try it what it about asked max new directions it about some specific things that happen to teenagers and young adults quite commonly it can cover such subjects as drugs violence various criminal activities gambling and even sex it might not be quite equal to preawareness courses in it impact on his life simply because he knows it simulation but if he will listen to our explanation of our research he will see that our simulations are as real as possible suppose we grant the realism of your simulations said eldon what would like to know is what our sons would experience in your sessions on drugs and sex yes echoed jinny emphatically the simulation on drugs do have to include druglike euphoria to be realistic they will not induce real tolerance or addiction as you know it and they will also include our simulations of crashing or drug hangovers and overdosing they will also simulate the effects of addiction including withdrawal and no simulation would be complete without some episodes of loss of friends failure at school even loss of family and last but not least we have simulation of druginjection diseases now for the tough one sex of course all these courses are optional and you can pick any combination you like now how do we teach sex well quite frankly there is no other way than to simulate the real thing it is just as safe as abstinence physically but if you do nt want him to be exposed to carnal knowledge just yet this course is nt for him we simulate all types of sexual encounters from dating with gradual increases in intimacy to sleazy encounters with whores and whorehoppers there are lessons to be learned from each we believe and then of course there are whole range of consequences to deal with pregnancy disease social ostracism violent jealousy and so on what do you think so far sounds great said jon not so fast said his mother marie believe this will require some discussion at home in private said max of course said marla here are some brochures take your time by the way said jinny how did you collect your data for the simulations in these courses mean do nt you have to wire people up while they are engaged in the pertinent activity yes you are correct realism can only be achieved by recording the actual impressions as they happen ethical questions arose in the development of these courses for obvious reasons in most cases we simply wired volunteer subjects and recorded all their impressions over period of time this is somewhat clumsy however since receiving and recording equipment must be within one hundred meters of the subject to function one solution to that was to wire all the members of number of gangs of teenage hoodlums and station the equipment in their hideouts we managed to get some of them to carry tiny receiverrecorders on their persons when they left the premises in other cases we went to other countries to get the data in no case did we encourage or suggest any behavior at all we simply paid people to allow us to record all their activities and kept it up long enough to get all we needed so what you re saying is that our kids will be going through the same experiences as hoodlums vagrants and criminals said marie yes that right your average wellbehaved teenager would have had to be tracked for years to have given us the necessary data these kids were making mistakes at very fast rate so we used them what did they get for their trouble asked jon money of course and in few cases we actually saved their lives by alerting the authorities when they were close to death they were satisfied with the deal well that quite lot to think about said max we better go home and get started the discussions were long and emotional in the end realism won out over the urge to protect one child from exposure to reality both boys were signed up for the courses except that eric was nt allowed to take the sex or drug courses growing up fast the hours were changed to weekends days and evenings for their new courses the boys became very excited about their experiences there both past and future it was the anticipation of future experiences that drove their little imaginations wild soon however the exhilaration of new thrills began to give way to the cold hard realities of the consequences of their actions thought was gonner became frequent refrain for both boys in describing their course experiences the fact that they knew it was all simulation somehow got lost in the heat of the moment eventually however they became somewhat blasé about the simulations excitement dwindled anticipation evaporated and it all became matteroffact their parents were quite satisfied with the results of the courses which was that the boys had nt gotten into any serious trouble but both parents and children thought it was time to examine their options again passing it on we are at present working on courses for young adults marla told them but since they are not ready yet have another option for you what would you think about these two boys gathering data for us they are in the right age range and they are already wired for reception we could very easily change their wiring to transmissiontype and provide you with receivers and recorders we would pay you for your trouble then if you and the boys decided to they could go to the courses they helped to create free of charge but our boys are nt delinquents or hoodlums jinny strongly objected that good point marla agreed but for these courses weve decided on different approach we think that the volatility of the teenage years gives way to different set of problems for the young adult rather that exploring all the wild temptations we think that their main focus will be on beginning to build life most will think of how to set out on their own to start doing things their way for those reasons and others we want to focus this course on the average young adult we think that is the way to get the most relevant data for the typical student these courses are being designed for so what sort of courses will they be asked max they will cover some of the typical crossroadstype decisions young adults must make we think marriage jobseeking homeseeking adult friendmaking and having kids of their own fall into this category we are adding others as the data comes in and probably will continue to add them as long as we receive data we have data from about dozen young adults over threeyear span now and we plan to gather it for five more years before starting the courses so what do you think it sounds very interesting and think we will give it lot of thought eldon commented is there anything else we need to know perhaps you be interested to know that just as in our teenage studies the vital signs of our subjects will be constantly monitored of course the subjects must carry their recorders with them when they leave home for the monitoring to be effective the portable recorders do more than record they have an emergency transmitter which sends distress signal when vital signs indicate an emergency very thorough said max we ll have an equally thorough discussion and let you know chapter leaving the nest high education jon and eric were reluctant research subjects at first they resented the intrusion on their privacy and the little portable recordertransmitter devices were clumsy both boys left home without them several times sometimes intentionally and sometimes not that soon ceased however when they learned that they would not be paid for the days they left them at home and their privacy concerns were greatly relieved when marla told them that the data had no name tags on it it was encoded in its raw form she said and when downloaded over the phone lines it became anonymous soon they were taking it for granted as nothing more than an easy way to make few bucks the fact that their parents let them keep it all made it more palatable too they entered the local university at the same time but with different goals jon was interested in pure science and wanted to pursue biophysics eric liked sports girls fast cars and beer in that order he wanted to major in physed and campusology at the end of five years jon had his advanced degree in biophysics and hot job prospects eric had social disease fouryear degree in secondary education and tryout with majorleague soccer club and the data bank at dream school was full enough to begin the young adult courses neither jon nor eric wanted to interrupt their careers to take the new courses even for free and both felt that they had already learned the lessons likely to be in it dream school administrators were sympathetic and allowed them to postpone their eligibility indefinitely look out world here they come jon took position with robotics manufacturer in another state eric got position on professional soccer team but was injured in his first season he came back from his injury bit too soon and crippled himself he could still walk and run thanks to his prosthesis but he was nt good enough to stay on the team he came home and sulked while jon learned the robotics racket eric was at home feeling sorry for himself and sinking deeper into substance abuse his parents finally despaired of trying to help him and evicted him it was now sink or swim for eric at the local homeless shelter eric hit bottom with no money for drugs he had to dry out with no drugs he had to take hard look at himself he did nt like what he saw eric decided to clean up his act since the shelter had resident religious guidance counselor he decided to give religion try religion agreed with eric soon he found structure in it that allowed him to set goals and impose selfdiscipline he reconciled with his parents and moved back in with them he got job as coach for high school soccer team his team did well and he found someone to spend time with he bought house and settled down jon returns to dream school jon found robotmaking exciting at first but it soon lost its luster the challenges were always there but the goals never seemed to vary much he longed for something with higher set of purposes than making widgets more efficiently then he began to think about dream school yes they could use man with his skills and talent the pay wouldnt be quite the same but the challenges and goals would be much loftier and besides he always liked marla jon was surprised at how much older marla looked she wore her age well actually but jon had nt seen her since high school jon this is my husband aaron aaron you remember jonathan haynes do nt you our star pupil of course do how are things jon not bad sir and looking better all the time aaron quickly looked around the room then back at jon oh youre calling me sir thought there was someone else in the room he said anyway welcome aboard marla said with the same little grin jon remembered from years before thanks where do start how about another tencent tour marla suggested lead on this time marla began with the first floor support systems there was data reception analysis storage and transmission to the rooms there was even system to receive data from the students as they encountered the computer simulations of the various courses and there was room for 3d projection of any data from any source for analysis by human beings we can recreate any interaction here that takes place in any of our rooms explained aaron since we have both the data to create the simulation and the student data this is all new since you were here observed marla we have always had statistical analysis of the data by our computer programs what we felt we were lacking was human observation of atypical interactions this fills that void so now you are gathering data from all your students while here how about away from here yes since they are wired for both reception and transmission most of them have recorders at home we even have some who carry portables like you did replied aaron and that brings us to the second floor said marla we are now so overcome with data that we had to take the second floor for storage and processing and we added new tenstory building behind this one for the increased student load any big changes in the rooms no they re just the way you left them said aaron so what my part in all this first you ve got to do what all new employees have to do marla said you ve got to take any courses you have nt had yet for the next six weeks jon spent eight hours day five days week in the young adult courses he enjoyed them and felt that he had learned few things in the process he even thought he recognized some his own old data ok what next boss jon asked marla debriefing she replied you ll spend two weeks with our staff discussing what you thought about the courses and how you think they can be improved oh it wo nt take that long to tell you everything know two weeks later jon still had opinions to offer his bosses however had other agendas his technical skills were needed now to improve the hardware eric on the rebound eric was going through his own changes he was now married to elissa and they were expecting little girl he had drifted away from his past religious fervor and was looking for something to replace it he looked into the occult the supernatural and the extraterrestrial he read theologies from to and some that just had number he read atheist and agnostic literature he read all the philosophers great and small everything he read had grain of truth in it but nothing was quite satisfactory agnosticism however expressed his lack of conviction quite well eric and jon met occasionally in the old neighborhood on one of those occasions jon reminded eric that he still had his eligibility for the young adult courses at dream school and he gave him bit of sales pitch from his own experiences that was enough to get eric started again at dream school going once or twice week for few hours he finished the course in six months sure wish have taken this thing sooner he told jon maybe would nt have screwed my life up so badly maybe not but look you seem to have learned the lessons on your own and look what it cost me could ve learned them here without ending my life probably jon agreed at least you would nt have been living on the edge yeah that edge is bitch only weak irregular heartbeat away from cashing in and no monitors eric comes home jon talked marla and aaron into adding eric to the board of advisors for course development eric brought with him the authenticity of experience for many of the things the courses taught eric continued his search for light to guide by he and jon often discussed religion and philosophy jon never had formed any convictions so he was agnostic as well they both found it easier to say why they didnt believe in particular thing than what they did believe this state of affairs persisted for many years they both continued to investigate new doctrines and points of view but without finding anything worthwhile for time they dabbled in politics but found it wanting they were interested in art and anthropology but found no profound meaning in either opinions opinions the world is full of opinions jon would sometimes remark yes but what is our opinion eric would reply jon usually didnt answer except to throw up his hands in despair the first big clue it was during this period of uncertainty that jon and eric read about new discovery in biophysics it was reported that investigators had succeeded in replicating every single molecule of certain bacterium they had placed their synthetic life form in the appropriate medium with all conditions right for maximum survival chances they even gave it tiny electrical stimulus to start it off as they watched it all the data was correct except for one thing it never showed any signs of life what was missing read the caption below the picture of the synthetic germ it had all the equipment all the conditions and all the stimulus what else does it take let reason this out suggested jon their data is undeniable they repeated the experiment five times before giving up what else could be necessary basic questions what defines life jon asked eric well there is where you get into opinion again the basic criterion is that it must process food grow and reproduce itself that leaves out viruses and certain semiorganic synthetic molecules which can do some but not all of those things ok but how do you determine instantly what is alive and what is not all life has some delicate electrical activity going on in its body at all times and all life responds to stimulus according to its genetic programming pain the common denominator we respond to lot of different stimuli ourselves observed eric we respond most reliably to pain though do nt we yes all life forms do so you re saying all life feels pain that my opinion and it shared by many others in the field its not been subject to verification yet but all indications point to that conclusion so what do the scientists put into the synthetic bacterium that feels the pain asked eric what do you mean do you think molecule feels pain probably not then how can collection of them feel pain the spark theory do nt know but is nt that what we all are just collection of molecules do nt know but we all come from some living thing instead of cold test tube maybe there is some kind of spark that must be passed on in order for life to exist woah you re getting pretty deep for washedup jock with plastic knees however you do seem to have point how do you suppose that this spark gets there and what it is and where does it go when you die yeah that too do nt have answers jon just questions you re the expert here eric spark metaphysics maybe we are more in your field here than mine this spark thing is not ordinary physics can assure you have you run across any good theories in your many journeys into the great minds of the human race lots of them and they all involve the concept of the soul according to some religions we all posses an immortal soul some also accord that privilege to animals some go so far as to say all living creatures one even says that all rocks and everything else in the world is alive whatever the case it seems the logical candidate to be the spark that can feel pain makes as much sense as anything else so according to religious consensus is the soul passed from mother to child or does it come out of the air none that know of claim that the mother gives her child soul but they do nt say exactly where it does come from either still if you accept the view that all living things have soul it gives you mechanism for sensing pain and therefore why it is alive ok suppose we accept that hypothesis what can we deduce from that premise recycled souls not much really said eric some religions postulate that our souls are recyclable and go through many life experiences in many different life forms reincarnation is also part of some philosophical disciplines it makes sense really to recycle otherwise you might die the day you were born and have no life at all and by recycling in different forms we certainly get much wider range of experiences that view would certainly please the animal rights advocates or would it how would they like the idea that their lawn had right not to be mowed that trees had right not to be cut down for esthetic reasons ah but we digress said jon yes is nt that what we re supposed to be doing the great parallel of life to sum up we have concluded that we probably do have an immortal soul and that it probably does recycle it may even recycle to other forms of life and that soul is what feels pain and makes us alive and responsive to pain and other stimuli so what does that lead us to is it just me or is there something vaguely familiar about this scenario here we are our souls safe from harm by any physical means and we re going through experiences which we can learn from but we wont consciously remember the lessons in our next life perhaps they will be with us in our subconscious mind or some other level does nt all this sound vaguely familiar now that you mention it it sounds like giant version of early dream school chapter putting it all together nature takes its course jon and eric did nt discuss philosophy much for many months after that maybe the whole idea of life being just like dream school was too strange or maybe they were just bored with philosophy jon turned his attention to part of his life that was too long neglected his social life he began dating young woman named catrina dataprocessor at dream school and generally enjoyed what life had to offer he and eric doubledated sometimes and the foursome got on quite famously jon and catrina had number of interests in common as catrina was more intellectual than most women jon had met she was good at chess trivia games and an absolute whiz at logic puzzles that fascinated jon since he had never met an attractive female who was his intellectual equal at times he was forced to admit she was bit more than his equal catrina and elissa were bit awkward at first as they struggled to find common ground between them elissa came from bluecollar background and had spent most of her life learning survival skills she was witty urbane and quick study but she had never had time to pursue academics beyond her four year degree parttime work after classes did nt leave much time for it both of them recognized that the other was genuinely searching for that common ground however and that kept friction to minimum finally they realized that what they had in common was that they each knew things that the other wanted to know catrina taught elissa how to modify dataprocessing software and elissa taught catrina how to cook the boys meanwhile were learning to enjoy life fulltime neighborhood soccer games were frequent on weekends as well as picnics and boating excursions with the girls there seemed to be energy for whatever whim that crossed their minds to do and no end in sight around thanksgiving jon invited catrina to move into his place she was already packed she said and wanted to know what had taken him so long to ask the clash of the worlds new year day 2540 found both couples at jon and catrina to watch the soccer world championships they feasted on chili made with blackeyed peas and had few homebrews to cool down the chili and jalepeño peppers after the game they all did little area cleanup then sank down in the cushions to relax it was about that time of course that the doorbell rang we are with the armageddon watchers association the two women announced the end of time as we know it is at hand and we have come to warn you is it coming before sundown jon asked tongueincheek where are your manners jon haynes catrina asked before the women had chance to consider their answer invite them in before they freeze to death everyone found seat in the living room in front of roaring firesimulation in the fake fireplace warm beverages were passed around and the serious conversation began now what was it that you came to tell us catrina asked jon wondered if she was being serious or just condescending the truth was about halfway between we believe that the endtime is upon us the older of the two replied unless we repent of our sins immediately we are doomed to spend an eternity in hell that long time eric noted somewhat mockingly yes it is replied the younger of the two and you re headed straight there with that attitude you may be right about eric attitude replied jon but what exactly defines what is sin and what is not it what you feel in your heart that matters said the older woman nothing else matters but that ok but which feelings are sins asked jon we have list of the feelings that are considered evil and sinful the younger woman replied it is taken directly from the modernday revelations as given to our eternal saint fatima two hundred and fifty years ago ok but that is based on the authority that you personally give to your eternal saint said eric what would like to know is what do you think sinful feeling is we have no authority to say anything differently from what is in our scriptures replied the older woman before the younger one could speak but yet you do have the authority to say what historical figure knew the truth argued eric so if you can say with certainty which person knew the truth are you able to recognize the truth or just the reputation of the person do nt understand your question sir replied the older woman do said the younger woman he is trying in his sarcastic way to question the roots of our faith and for me sir the answer is my faith is based on the love that read in the writings of our eternal saint and that feel in the community of believers very well spoken observed elissa believe that you are saying that you are able to recognize love and that you believe that truth must come from love is that right yes replied the young woman my father loved me dearly observed catrina and he always said and did the things that he thought best for me but you know as hard as he tried he did nt always tell me the truth every time the best he could do was to tell me what he believed was true that all anyone can be expected to do you know and loved him dearly for that yet he was wrong sometimes in spite of all his love so what other way is there to know what is true asked the older woman an excellent question injected eric this is your field eric said jon now the time to reveal it to us that just it jon ca nt reveal it to you no one can reveal it to anyone else each person must reveal it to themselves if that makes sense replied eric no matter how much or how little intelligence person has that person still has to be the sole judge of what is truth and what is otherwise you mean that we are expected to pass judgment on the truthfulness of the holy scriptures asked the young woman incredulously you already have have nt you replied eric have nt you already proclaimed them all true yes you re quite right said the older woman with the first smile either of them had shown suppose we do judge the truth of what we read and do you disagree with anything in these writings asked eric why no replied the older woman certainly not not even the part which says that no woman should be allowed to speak out in church asked eric and that if she has question she should wait until she gets home and ask her husband ve never read that proclaimed the younger woman then you have nt read it all replied eric yes he right observed the older woman that is in the new testament we have many stops to make may we leave some literature with you of course said catrina with soft smile and thank you for your visit you re very welcome they both replied as they made their way out into the cold january wind eric explains it all well eric you ran them off now tell us the true meaning of life said elissa one tiny step at time my child said eric with pious smile ok ll bite said jon what the first step good and bad the first step my unbelieving friend is to define what is good and what is bad eric pontificated up for that said catrina let hear it well it not list if that what you re expecting what then it really quite simple eric began everything that feels good comfortable and calming to us is what we consider good everything that feels bad uncomfortable and unsettling to us we consider bad that includes ideas people activities even inanimate objects have you got it now that sounds too simple observed jon it is replied eric but it true think about it so if think someone is evil it because that person makes me fell bad uncomfortable or unsettled right asked catrina every time replied eric you had to ask did nt you jon chided elissa take it that you ve heard this before catrina asked her oh yes and he just getting started she replied think he got something there said jon but not sure want to catch it are you saying that how things are or how they ought to be eric an excellent question he replied saying that how things are now and always have been each person decides for themselves what is right and what is wrong usually by the method just described agree that everyone has an equally valid opinion about right and wrong even if no two of them agree exactly so right and wrong is real and is in the mind of each individual what disagree with is the idea of universal standard by which we can judge people or supernatural force called evil which causes us to sin but really not in position to say how things should be agree said catrina what next eric the next step is to learn that altruism is an illusion he said that practically everything we do and think is done and thought to seek our own pleasure or avoid our own pain to see this we must understand that we are defining pleasure as every good feeling we have satisfaction contentment agreement gratification relief and any other feeling that is on the positive side of the pleasurepain scale pain on the other hand is every negative feeling the precise opposite of the feelings just mentioned so when we help needy person it is because we want happy conscience which feels better not because we are noble yes we do feel sympathy for that person plight but we mainly act because it feels good and comfortable to us when we help person in need so it more selfish than altruistic when we help others the pleasure principle in other words if it feels good we are already doing it observed catrina well put replied eric and you might add that if it feels bad we are already trying to avoid it yes can see that you are probably right said jon ca nt think of anything that do just because it feels bad do some things that feel bad but do them to avoid greater pain later an insightful observation said eric so what next oh great teacher asked catrina with just little mocking tone reincarnation the next step my child is to understand reincarnation you see without reincarnation many lives make no sense at all those that are very short spent in solitude spent in constant pain for example but if we include the possibility of reincarnation no life is without sense because it is only random small part of much larger continuum that means of course that we must concede the existence of an eternal aspect of our being you mean that spark thing soul said jon correctamundo the perfect universe so what next catrina inquired the next step is to put the elements we have together and try to make some collective sense of them we have done away with the concepts of good and evil and replaced them with the concept of pleasurepain driven universe we have stipulated that this universe contains immortal beings which have mortal bodies furthermore we have given credence to the idea that these immortal beings recycle endlessly from life form to life form what picture do these colors paint the picture see said jon is universe where pain and pleasure are of utmost importance and time is almost meaningless and if that is so catrina added then the process of life in this universe is quite universal mean that it is pretty well equally valid for everyone everywhere since everyone feels pain and is tempted by pleasure and it is clear that no evangelists or teacher of any kind is needed to explain it to anyone the purpose of life but do nt we need some kind of purpose for all this pleasure and pain asked jon indeed we do replied eric you know the old saying that which does not kill us teaches us that seems bit too simple jon remarked will agree that it is simple replied eric but if you will examine human history you will note that the failure to grasp the simple truths is our greatest collective weakness we do not see the forest for the trees in our way so then the whole purpose of leaving our peaceful state of spiritual bliss in the immortal beyond is to come here and learn lessons from the pain and pleasure asked catrina yes that is the logical conclusion of the tenants we have incorporated into our view of the universe these past few minutes it leads one to suspect that as purely spiritual beings we probably do nt experience pain and pleasure as we do here the limits of knowledge and to what end or goal do these lessons point asked jon now you have progressed beyond my ability to speculate replied eric perhaps it is to become more enlightened beings or perhaps it is just to become what we have the potential to become really ca nt look at the human race and see any direction in its development it does not seem to me that people have learned anything at all in the six million years of their existence see your point said catrina but there are still some things about this picture like for one thing it does not lose its logic in the face of wars and natural disasters as some religions do that is to say you do nt have to ask why god allows such things to happen if you say that such horrors are part of the scheme and happen at random if we accept that the effects of physical pain disappear with physical death then nothing that happens to us physically in any particular life will affect us in the next ok but if we do nt remember our past lives how do we benefit from the lessons we learned in it asked jon good question replied eric wish had an easy answer to it but do nt perhaps these lessons remain in our subconscious mind or perhaps we remember them only when we are in our spiritual state between lives it very difficult to say because of the nature verses nurture question you mean that we ca nt tell whether person was born mean or was made mean by mistreatment said jon but in this case is nt the real question that if he was born mean was it because of his genetic inheritance his enviornment or because of past life experience yes you re right that what should have said replied eric so with this view we have three variables which could make person mean or kind or whatever and we have no way to tell what source is responsible for what percent of their personality therefore it impossible to determine if person is evolving in particular direction or just dealing with his parents genes andor their childraising abilities so we should leave the unknown also unspoken the uncertainty principle sounds pretty random if you ask me said catrina an excellent point said eric if you accept the universe we have described so far then natural randomness and uncertainty is perfectly adequate to explain the ups and downs of life no longer do we need to seek moral explanations for what happens to us because no explanation is needed we are simply here and things happen it does nt matter what happens because we can learn from it all none of it can hurt us because death will take away all the stings do nt you see how perfect it all is am getting too excited no dear this is just about normal for you said elissa eric have you by any chance ever hear of heisenberg uncertainty principle asked catrina no is he philosopher preacher or philanderer he was physicist and in 1927 paper of his was published in physics journal called zeitschrift für physik at the end of his paper he concluded that we can not know as matter of principle the present in all its details he was speaking directly about matter on the atomic level of course but the implications are enormous sir isaac newton once postulated that it would be possible to predict the entire course of the future if only we knew the position and momentum of every particle in the universe today the idea of such perfect prediction is meaningless since we can not know the position and momentum of even one particle so we live in universe that is by its very nature unpredictable and uncertain very interesting but what is your point my point is that the unpredictability built into our universe makes it impossible for any of us to accurately predict or precisely alter the future since we can not do either we can not avoid pain in our lives no matter how carefully we plan and execute our plans that is what makes pain our universal teacher so unavoidable and universal glad we only have these discussions once year said eric chapter the final years the birth of cult jon and catrina found their living arrangement very advantageous taxwise they saved about ten percent on their income taxes by not being married the only disadvantage was that they had to maintain separate health insurance policies of course the subject of children was touchy one with all the legal and social angles to be considered the young adult course at dream school was well received and quite popular among those who could afford it some of eric ideas had seeped into them as if by osmosis some of the students even formed discussion group of their own after they had finished the course they asked eric to drop in and he was only too happy to oblige as the months and years wore on eric ideas gained more and more admirers the discussion group was too large to use borrowed space so they pooled their resources and rented building of their own eric was now guru eric stayed aloof from the everyday details of the group so the group organized itself into officers and committees eric was given an honorary title of spiritual leader all this was bit much for elissa but she tolerated it because it enhanced their social life and it was she not any of the followers who brought eric back down to earth when his ego floated above his head eric obtained minister permit to perform weddings and the group got few tax advantages too it was now officially church and unofficially business the church of new awareness cona for short was now part of the local scenery his new duties left eric short of time this was remedied by an indefinite leave of absence from dream school that left him short of money that was remedied by percentage of the cona income being earmarked for the minister that left cona bit short on money to pay the bills and that was remedied by asking the members to cough up more finally eric began to question whether it was all worth the effort so he asked the members if they thought the group was headed in the right direction or was lost growing pains the members were not bashful about expressing themselves yes they said they thought the direction was ok but they missed the informality of the old group they felt that the church was too big to be comfortable they were glad to have eric full time but they wished there was another way to do it so why not split up eric asked we have enough members to form half dozen small congregations around town these could meet once or twice week and we could rent place for meeting of all of us at the beginning of each season if you stager your weekly meetings can attend most of them and so it was done eric became circuit minister and almost everyone was happy with having their own neighborhood meeting place but then the individual congregations began to draw members away from other churches in the area the congregations became what they had sought to escape large and the other churches in the area did nt take the loss of members lying down either cona was regularly denounced as devilworshipers and worse under great political pressure the local government became involved in the controversy millions of dollars of public funds were secretly spent to investigate eric and his followers when nothing of substance was found they manufactured it eric was accused of everything from childmolestation to plots to overthrow the government nothing was ever brought to trial since they knew they couldnt prove any of their lies they simply leaked their accusations to the press in the guise of grand jury investigations but the damage was done moving west eric and elissa had had enough the took their children jenifer and mark and moved out into the wide open spaces of the great plains to their surprise many of the cona members followed them they formed small agricultural and manufacturing community in the middle of the tall grass they were now cult and they continued to come to the new town in ever greater numbers not just ordinary folks actually but the intellectual cream of society when their numbers became strain on the local ecology they invented technology to compensate when that was nt possible they just spread out further into the prairie soon they had political majority in two states finally they felt safe jon and catrina simply could not resist and moved west to be with them to ease the pain of leaving dream school they opened branch campus on the prairie and to celebrate their tenth anniversary of cohabitation they had eric tie the knot for them in simple little ceremony among the spring flowers the meaning of group living what does this all mean eric jon asked him one fine summer morning mean the towns the people the factories the churches whats it all for are we in some way improving life on earth or even for these folks do nt really know jon if we are right about what we are saying then none of this is necessary at all the universe we are describing was perfect on the day it was made and needs no help from us or any supernatural being to accomplish its purpose in ancient times that belief was classified as deism as opposed to theism theism says that god or the gods do intervene from time to time because they did nt get it quite right when they made the universe so if this pleasurepain lessonteaching universe runs just fine without anyone around to explain it or guide it what are we doing here just killing time the way we want to guess it helps me to focus on the idea that we are here to learn spiritual lessons that way realize how unimportant all these other trappings really are and do nt get caught up in them sure it part of life that we have to take care of all the mundane details of existence like food shelter transportation etc but we do nt need to focus on any of them over what we need for basic existence as defined by our place in society worldly goods so it keeps you from trying to be rich famous powerful or good looking right but you are all of those things but not because tried to be do nt you see none of those things are my doings and you be just as well off without them better probably there sure would be lot less temptation and you know how weak am in that area stoicism revisionist style some critics say that we are just modernday stoics and that we have nothing new to offer how do you respond to that pretty much agree with that we differ from the ancient stoics only in our justification for our stoic beliefs of course it takes longer to teach our brand of stoicism because our justification is fairly complicated but in the end we do arrive at the same conclusion as the ancients about what is important personal ethics is first and everything else is very distant second precisely so do nt feel bad when someone says that we offer nothing new think our approach is new and helpful to explain why we think stoicism is the right attitude but do nt think it is important at all to come to new conclusion about what is important in this life people have known that for long long time truth never changes that hard sell to people looking for new thrill an easy answer to all their problems it an impossible sell to them jon do nt even try only when they have begun to recognize that their quest for pleasure is their animal nature can they begin to learn about their other spiritual nature some reach that point early in life some late and some never maybe they have to wait for their next life to gain any wisdom or maybe it works some way do nt understand at all limitations revisited so does any of our wisdom accumulate from one life to the next who knows jon certainly not me trying to speculate on things like that is simply an exercise in egotistical selfmassage the only true knowledge we have is about what is right here right now and all we know about that is what our senses seem to be telling us think that the builders of this universe gave us what we need to live stoic life here base that on my observations of the here and now and do nt think we need any other knowledge mom and apple pie you know eric we do nt fit in very with the american ideals of high achievement and competitiveness that like mom and apple pie with some people yes and so was slavery and hoolahoops so how about all the various reform movements how can you just dismiss the idea of correcting so many inequities and injustices some of the movements are dealing with questions of quality of life for the foreseeable future and some with life or death questions does nt any of that seem at all important to you all of it has only very distant secondary importance jon if person is so agitated by situation that he can not focus on anything else then he might as well act upon it but in the end nothing we do here physically is either permanent or important all that really matters is our own spirituality the other cheek how about selfdefense that is question we may have to face here very soon there is group called the sahara club that is harassing our members and some property destruction has taken place that is question each person must answer for themselves do not have any rule or position on selfdefense because each provocation and each individual is different personally do nt see any advantage in turning the other cheek to someone who has just slapped one of yours without any provocation on the other hand do nt see any advantage to resisting or prosecuting anyone who is stealing little food from you when you have plenty and he is starving people are strange and some would rather steal from you than humble themselves to beg in between those two extremes lie at lot of fine distinctions about selfdefense and must confess that can not generalize much more about them kicking butts but what about cona and the sahara club you re our secular leader now jon what do you want to do gather few good men and go kick their collective butts sound reasonable to me but first hand out our walkietalkies to all households and businesses and wait for their next provocation then they will know what the buttkicking is all about they did nt have to wait long early the next morning several witless skinheaded saharans tried to torch gas station belonging to cona member first they got gasoline on one of their own and accidentally set him on fire then they tried to use him as human torch to set the storage tanks off he objected and shot three other saharans before collapsing from the heat all the commotion brought out several cona members and fierce gun battle was on the battle only lasted ten minutes the first thing the skinheads did was to shoot out all the street lights around them big mistake as they sprayed the neighborhood with their big automatic rifles one of the cona members arrived with nightvision scope on his rifle the skinned heads showed up very brightly in the scope after that night skinheads and weirdoes came from all over the country to try to avenge the murder of their comrades they might have succeeded too if it had not have been for amal amal and the night visitors amal was born in iraq or in lebanon or in jordan wherever he was born he was trouble from the earliest days of his life he had killed one man for each of his years by his tenth birthday and after that no one could keep count by his thirtieth birthday he was the top military officer of the combined iraqisyrian republic by his fortieth birthday he was the military dictator of all of the middle east he wore blue turban wherever he went and europe was where he went remember the suffering of our moslem martyrs in bosnia was his battle cry he conquered europe after long bloody war he gained control of multitudes of nuclear weapons in the process and then he turned his attention to the devil of all devils amal told his people that the night was too dark in the united states and that it was their sacred duty to light it up for them they did for ten nights in row amal sent his night visitors to all the major cities of the lower fortyeight the americans tried to respond but they had no targets to shoot at all of amal armies were in europe by now and nuclear weapons would kill more european than amalites they could send them to the middle east of course and some did but that did little to slow down amal and it may have even increased his resolve soon he was ready to load his men into transport ships for the transatlantic crossing fortunately for the cona group they occupied no major cities or even lived close to any the selfsustaining nature of their communities was their greatest asset now the ten nights of amal had left the county in complete shambles and only those who needed no commerce could survive that group did not include skinheads weirdoes or radicals of most kinds they scattered with the winds and soon became dust the survivors the survivalists of course were the radicals who did survive they trusted only in god and all others keep your distance that tactic worked very well for them for several years but then their supplies ran out and they could nt grow or find more without encountering other people they also did nt hear or did nt believe that the war was over after ten long years not many of them were alive by then and the ones that still were didnt trust anyone else the bitter end amal meanwhile was defeated and killed somewhere in the atlantic his crusade had been thwarted by sudden attack from the rear by newly revived mongolian horde it seems they wanted to relive the glories of the khans not much was left of the northern hemisphere when the wars were all over direct war damage plus nuclear fallout made life very difficult there many tried to go south but that was full of difficulties also the fallout had reached there and small wars raged in many southern hemisphere areas the conans were as usual of several different opinions many wanted to stay there and die whatever natural death awaited them some wanted to help nature along little some migrated to south america and some managed to find ways to live little longer where they were when asked for advice on their present predicament eric was his usual direct self choose your own poison he told them there is nt much left that is nt poisoned so you have plenty to choose from but what about you eric what will you do they asked him die right here probably he replied prefer dignified natural death but if the pain gets too bad who knows what ll do hoping to come back as peaceful beautiful plant in some remote mountain meadow in my next life but of course the bugs will eat me alive if do and with that sparkling gem of wisdom eric tripped and fell off the edge of high bluff into oblivion his family and his remaining followers lived on while longer then radiation poisoning killed them all all except jon that is jon and his family had been vacationing in caracas when the ten nights arrived in north america they stayed on there since they could nt get any transportation home by the time they could get transportation they decided they did nt want to go they became known locally as the strange gringos with the funny religion they were tolerated mostly because jon could fix things that broke down and lot of things broke down they lived many years after that until they died in pandemic of new disease no one knew any cure for it or even what to call it all they knew was that it caused person to break out all over with tiny red spots and develop very high fever one person said the small spots looked like pox the end page56
