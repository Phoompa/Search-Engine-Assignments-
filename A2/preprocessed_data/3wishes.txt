the three wishes once upon time woodcutter lived happily with his wife in pretty little log cabin in the middle of thick forest each morning he set off singing to work and when he came home in the evening plate of hot steaming soup was always waiting for him one day however he had strange surprise he came upon big fir tree with strange open holes on the trunk it looked somehow different from the other trees and just as he was about to chop it down the alarmed face of an elf popped out of hole what all this banging asked the elf you re not thinking of cutting down this tree are you it my home live here the woodcutter dropped his axe in astonlshment well he stammered with all the other trees there are in this forest you have to pick this one lucky was in or would have found myself homeless taken aback at these words the woodcutter qulckly recovered for after all the elf was quite tiny while he himself was big hefty chap and he boldly replied ll cut down any tree like so all right all right broke in the elf shall we put it this way if you do nt cut down this tree grant you three wishes agreed the woodcutter scratched his head three wishes you say yes agree and he began to hack at another tree as he worked and sweated at his task the woodcutter kept thinking about the magic wishes ll see what my wife thinks the woodcutter wife was busily cleaning pot outside the house when her husband arrived grabbing her round the waist he twirled her in delight hooray hooray our luck is in the woman could not understand why her husband was so pleased with himself and she shrugged herself free later however over glass of fine wine at the table the woodcutter told his wife of his meeting with the elf and she too began to picture the wonderful things that the elf three wishes might give them the woodcutter wife took first sip of wine from her husband glass nice she said smacking her lips wish had string of sausages to go with it though instantly she bit her tongue but too late out of the air appeared the sausages while the woodcutter stuttered with rage what have you done sausages what stupid waste of wish you foollsh woman wish they would stick up your nose no sooner sald than done for the sausages leapt up and stuck fast to the end of the woman nose this time the woodcutter wife flew into rage you idiot what have you done with all the things we could have wished for the mortified woodcutter who had just repeated his wife own mistake exclaimed chop luckily he stopped himself in time realizing with horror that he been on the point of having his tongue chopped off as his wife complained and blamed him the poor man burst out laughing if only you knew how funny you look with those sausages on the end of your nose now that really upset the woodcutter wife she had nt thought of her looks she tried to tug away the sausages but they would not budge she pulled again and again but in vain the sausages were firmly attached to her nose terrified she exclaimed they ll be there for the rest of my life feeling sorry for his wife and wondering how he could ever put up with woman with such an awkward nose the woodcutter said ll try grasping the string of sausages he tugged with all his might but he simply pulled his wife over on top of him the pair sat on the floor gazing sadly at each other what shall we do now they said each thinking the same thought there only one thing we can do ventured the woodcutter wife timidly yes afraid so her husband sighed remembering their dreams of riches and he bravely wished the third and last wish wish the sausages would leave my wife nose and they did instantly husband and wife hugged each other tearfully saying maybe we ll be poor but we ll be happy again that evening the only reminder of the woodcutter meeting with the elf was the string of sausages so the couple fried them gloomily thinking of what that meal had cost them
