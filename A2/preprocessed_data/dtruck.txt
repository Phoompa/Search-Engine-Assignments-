dad pickup copyright 1991 andrew varga since before can remember dad had this truck hed bought it used the year was two think he was forever proud of his truck because of how powerful the engine was the year turned eleven he built big box out of second hand plywood that covered the bed to stop it from rusting and to keep the rain and snow off the stuff inside he said this topperbox even had door in the back with hinges at the top dad was also collector of sorts he collected the it might be useful some day kind of stuff and kept it in his truck at least that what he always told mom whenever she asked him about cleaning it out once stood on the trailer hitch and unlatching the door of the topperbox peered inside of what could see there were the following items tires one looked badly worn two others had big chunks of tread missing these were still on the rims small horse trough dad got it at an auction once when we all were talking about getting pony for us kids to ride but it would nt hold water so my parents stalled on the pony until dad someday got it fixed two mammoth tackle boxes both were overflowing in fact never saw either of them outside the truck ever two dead car batteries maybe it was three five fishing rods three had the little metal loopthings broken off the tips one was missing its reel tools probably more that dan hawkins at the corner standard station owned bird feeder the glass was broken out but the pieces were still in the bed the rusted remains of my first bicycle dad had accidentally backed over it the first and swear only time had ever left it in the driveway chainsaw it was partially okay mostly disassembled empty pop bottles too many to count they were both in and out of their cartons and leaves and candy wrappers and the like the stuff inside often changed dad added to it from time to time and some of the smaller things disappeared the bed was rusted through in places inside the cab was no better the only clear spot was the part of the seat directly in front of the steering wheel the deep metal dashboard held the mail years worth of sale catalogs bills empty checkbooks and magazines with some burned out turn signal or brake light bulbs at least dozen bottle openers old hoses clamps and lord knows how many pens pencils and keys all tossed on at random the seat carried more mail the important stuff suppose an electric drill with the cord cut off pliers screwdrivers three or four worn lefthand work gloves the rights always seemed to be in the house winter hat the kind with big fake fur ear flaps that snapped together on top bent coat hanger or two couple of rolls of electrical tape and big old overcoat with the pockets worn through the floor was covered with among other things massive toolbox that was so full the top refused to close numerous oilstained rags our old socks and undershorts mostly pop bottles empty pall mall packs and few lucky strike tins couple of ball jars of vegetables that never made it inside from grandma house and monstrous tangled wad that consisted mostly of jumper cables odd lengths of rope tv antenna wire and the cord to the electric drill once peeked inside the glove box just out of curiosity it was completely empty except for magazine that had picture of woman on the front best can remember she was nt wearing much every saturday morning dad would run errands he often take me with him and we usually stop somewhere for candy or sodas along the way needless to say that one saturday morning brightened immensely when dad asked want to ride with me to the hardware store blurted an enthusiastic sure and off we went sometimes as started to get in stuff would come rolling out on the ground when open the passenger side door after dad would reach across and clear spot for me have to quickly toss it back in and scramble up on the seat slamming the door before it all rolled out again always enjoyed riding in dad truck papers shuffled keys tinkled and tools and bottles clanked and rattled at odd moments it was like being inside rolling music box and often get to watch through the cracked mirror just outside my window to see something that had found hole in the truck bed go rolling down the road for ways trying to follow us imagined also the clutch had been slipping for some time dad would just race the engine and let his foot slip off the pedal the truck would eventually start to move think dad had to replace some tool that he couldnt find that day so he could fix the washing machine again with family of six what do you expect he probably already had at least two of the right tool in the back truth is once anything went into dad truck it rarely came out again on purpose anyway had decided to wait in the truck at the hardware store it was too much work getting in and out of course if the hardware store had sold candy that would have been different matter as dad got back in the truck with new tool in hand looked in my mirror the outside mirror on dad side had been missing since before can remember the one at the top of the windshield was useless on account of the topperbox dad said there somebody behind us racing the engine he let go of the clutch pedal and the truck started moving backward its okay he replied we can get by them but they re getting closer warned we ll miss em he reassured me just then the driver of the other truck started beeping his horn think we re gon na hit them mumbled tucking myself beneath the dash as best could no we wo nt son dad replied as the truck picked up speed ka lunk was instantly and feared at the time permanently buried beneath catalogs newspapers cards letters and junk feeling movement above me carefully raised my head dad was shoveling away the debris with his hands are you all right he asked sure fine caught my breath as he cleared place for me on the seat later as we were returning home dad turned pretty fast way to clean off the dash was nt it sure was smiled dad finally sold that old truck couple of years before he passed away it had become home for lost mice by then anyway about year ago bought an old truck of my own have nt tried to wash or wax it yet lord knows you cant wax rust but keep the inside as clean as whistle well okay sort of
