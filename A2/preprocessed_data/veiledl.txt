for twentythree years and that during seventeen of these was allowed to cooperate with him and to keep notes of his doings it will be clear that have mass of material at my command the problem has always been not to find but to choose there is the long row of yearbooks which fill shelf and there are the dispatchcases filled with documents perfect quarry for the student not only of crime but of the social and official scandals of the late victorian era concerning these latter may say that the writers of agonized letters who beg that the honour of their families or the reputation of famous forebears may not be touched have nothing to fear the discretion and high sense of professional honour which have always distin guished my friend are still at work in the choice of these mem oirs and no confidence will be abused deprecate however in the strongest way the attempts which have been made lately to get at and to destroy these papers the source of these outrages is known and if they are repeated have mr holmes authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician the lighthouse and the trained cormorant will be given to the public there is at least one reader who will understand it is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and observation which have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit sometimes it fell easily into his lap but the most terrible human tragedies were often involved in those cases which brought him the fewest personal opportunities and it is one of these which now desire to record in telling it have made slight change of name and place but otherwise the facts are as stated one forenoon it was late in 1896 received hurried note from holmes asking for my attendance when arrived found him seated in smokeladen atmosphere with an elderly moth erly woman of the buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him this is mrs merrilow of south brixton said my friend with wave of the hand mrs merrilow does not object to tobacco watson if you wish to indulge your filthy habits mrs merrilow has an interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your presence may be useful anything can do you will understand mrs merrilow that if come to mrs ronder should prefer to have witness you will make her understand that before we arrive lord bless you mr holmes said our visitor she is that anxious to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels then we shall come early in the afternoon let us see that we have our facts correct before we start if we go over them it will help dr watson to understand the situation you say that mrs ronder has been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face and wish to god had not said mrs merrilow it was understand terribly mutilated well mr holmes you would hardly say it was face at all that how it looked our milkman got glimpse of her once peeping out of the upper window and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the front garden that is the kind of face it is when saw her happened on her unawares she covered up quick and then she said now mrs merrilow you know at last why it is that never raise my veil do you know anything about her history nothing at all did she give references when she came no sir but she gave hard cash and plenty of it quarters rent right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms in these times poor woman like me ca nt afford to turn down chance like that did she give any reason for choosing your house mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most then again only take the one and have no family of my own reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best it privacy she is after and she is ready to pay for it you say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the one accidental occasion well it is very remark able story most remarkable and do nt wonder that you want it examined do nt mr holmes am quite satisfied so long as get my rent you could not have quieter lodger or one who gives less trouble then what has brought matters to head her health mr holmes she seems to be wasting away and there something terrible on her mind murder she cries murder and once heard her you cruel beast you mon ster she cried it was in the night and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers through me so went to her in the morning mrs ronder says if you have anything that is troubling your soul there the clergy says and there the police between them you should get some help for gods sake not the police says she and the clergy ca nt change what is past and yet she says it would ease my mind if someone knew the truth before died well says if you wo nt have the regulars there is this detective man what we read about beggin your pardon mr holmes and she she fair jumped at it that the man says she wonder never thought of it before bring him here mrs merrilow and if he wo nt come tell him am the wife of ronder wild beast show say that and give him the name abbas parva here it is as she wrote it abbas parva that will bring him if he the man think he is and it will too remarked holmes very good mrs merrilow should like to have little chat with dr watson that will carry us till lunchtime about three oclock you may expect to see us at your house in brixton our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room no other verb can describe mrs merrilow method of progression than sherlock holmes threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books in the corner for few minutes there was constant swish of the leaves and then with grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he sought so excited was he that he did not rise but sat upon the floor like some strange buddha with crossed legs the huge books all round him and one open upon his knees the case worried me at the time watson here are my marginal notes to prove it confess that could make nothing of it and yet was convinced that the coroner was wrong have you no recollection of the abbas parva tragedy none holmes and yet you were with me then but certainly my own impression was very superficial for there was nothing to go by and none of the parties had engaged my services perhaps you would care to read the papers could you not give me the points that is very easily done it will probably come back to your memory as talk ronder of course was household word he was the rival of wombwell and of sanger one of the greatest showmen of his day there is evidence however that he took to drink and that both he and his show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy the caravan had halted for the night at abbas parva which is small village in berkshire when this horror occurred they were on their way to wimble don travelling by road and they were simply camping and not exhibiting as the place is so small one that it would not have paid them to open they had among their exhibits very fine north african lion sahara king was its name and it was the habit both of ronder and his wife to give exhibitions inside its cage here you see is photograph of the performance by which you will perceive that ronder was huge porcine person and that his wife was very magnificent woman it was deposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion was dangerous but as usual familiarity begat contempt and no notice was taken of the fact it was usual for either ronder or his wife to feed the lion at night sometimes one went sometimes both but they never allowed anyone else to do it for they believed that so long as they were the foodcarriers he would regard them as benefactors and would never molest them on this particular night seven years ago they both went and very terrible happening fol lowed the details of which have never been made clear it seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of the animal and the screams of the woman the different grooms and employees rushed from their tents carrying lanterns and by their light an awful sight was revealed ronder lay with the back of his head crushed in and deep clawmarks across his scalp some ten yards from the cage which was open close to the door of the cage lay mrs ronder upon her back with the creature squatting and snarling above her it had torn her face in such fashion that it was never thought that she could live several of thc circus men headed by leonardo the strong man and griggs the clown drove the creature off with poles upon which it sprang back into the cage and was at once locked in how it had got loose was mystery it was conjectured that the pair intended to enter the cage but that when the door was loosed the creature bounded out upon them there was no other point of interest in the evidence save that the woman in delirium of agony kept screaming coward coward as she was carried back to the van in which they lived it was six months before she was fit to give evidence but the inquest was duly held with the obvious verdict of death from misadventure what alternative could be conceived said you may well say so and yet there were one or two points which worried young edmunds of the berkshire constabulary smart lad that he was sent later to allahabad that was how came into the matter for he dropped in and smoked pipe or two over it thin yellowhaired man exactly was sure you would pick up the trail presently but what worried him well we were both worried it was so deucedly difficult to reconstruct the affair look at it from the lion point of view he is liberated what does he do he takes half dozen bounds forward which brings him to ronder ronder turns to fly the clawmarks were on the back of his head but the lion strikes him down then instead of bounding on and escaping he returns to the woman who was close to the cage and he knocks her over and chews her face up then again those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some way failed her what could the poor devil have done to help her you see the difficulty quite and then there was another thing it comes back to me now as think it over there was some evidence that just at the time the lion roared and the woman screamed man began shouting in terror this man ronder no doubt well if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from him again there were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of man being mingled with those of woman should think the whole camp was crying out by then as to the other points think could suggest solution should be glad to consider it the two were together ten yards from the cage when the lion got loose the man turned and was struck down the woman conceived the idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door it was her only refuge she made for it and just as she reached it the beast bounded after her and knocked her over she was angry with her husband for having encouraged the beasts rage by turning if they had faced it they might have cowed it hence her cries of coward brilliant watson only one flaw in your diamond what is the flaw holmes if they were both ten paces from the cage how came the beast to get loose is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it and why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of playing with them and doing tricks with them inside the cage possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments well watson there is this to be said for your theory ronder was man of many enemies edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible huge bully of man he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in his way expect those cries about monster of which our visitor has spoken were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed however our speculations are futile until we have all the facts there is cold partridge on the sideboard watson and bottle of montrachet let us renew our energies before we make fresh call upon them when our hansom deposited us at the house of mrs merrilow we found that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired abode it was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she should lose valuable lodger and she implored us before showing us up to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end then having reassured her we followed her up the straight badly carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious lodger it was close musty illventilated place as might be ex pected since its inmate seldom left it from keeping beasts in cage the woman seemed by some retribution of fate to have become herself beast in cage she sat now in broken arm chair in the shadowy corner of the room long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of her figure but at some period it must have been beautiful and was still full and voluptuous thick dark veil covered her face but it was cut off close at her upper lip and disclosed perfectly shaped mouth and delicately rounded chin could well conceive that she had indeed been very remarkable woman her voice too was well modulated and pleasing my name is not unfamiliar to you mr holmes said she thought that it would bring you that is so madam though do not know how you are aware that was interested in your case learned it when had recovered my health and was exam ined by mr edmunds the county detective fear lied to him perhaps it would have been wiser had told the truth it is usually wiser to tell the truth but why did you lie to him because the fate of someone else depended upon it know that he was very worthless being and yet would not have his destruction upon my conscience we had been so close so close but has this impediment been removed yes sir the person that allude to is dead then why should you not now tell the police anything you know because there is another person to be considered that other person is myself could not stand the scandal and publicity which would come from police examination have not long to live but wish to die undisturbed and yet wanted to find one man of judgment to whom could tell my terrible story so that when am gone all might be understood you compliment me madam at the same time am responsible person do not promise you that when you have spoken may not myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police think not mr holmes know your character and methods too well for have followed your work for some years reading is the only pleasure which fate has left me and miss little which passes in the world but in any case will take my chance of the use which you may make of my tragedy it will ease my mind to tell it my friend and would be glad to hear it the woman rose and took from drawer the photograph of man he was clearly professional acrobat man of magnifi cent physique taken with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and smile breaking from under his heavy moustache the selfsatisfied smile of the man of many conquests that is leonardo she said leonardo the strong man who gave evidence the same and this this is my husband it was dreadful face human pig or rather human wild boar for it was formidable in its bestiality one could imagine that vile mouth champing and foaming in its rage and one could conceive those small vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon the world ruffian bully beast it was all written on that heavyjowled face those two pictures will help you gentlemen to understand the story was poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust and doing springs through the hoop before was ten when became woman this man loved me if such lust as his can be called love and in an evil moment became his wife from that day was in hell and he the devil who tormented me there was no one in the show who did not know of his treatment he deserted me for others he tied me down and lashed me with his riding whip when complained they all pitied me and they all loathed him but what could they do they feared him one and all for he was terrible at all times and murderous when he was drunk again and again he was had up for assault and for cruelty to the beasts but he had plenty of money and the fines were nothing to him the best men all left us and the show began to go downhill it was only leonardo and who kept it up with little jimmy griggs the clown poor devil he had not much to be funny about but he did what he could to hold things together then leonardo came more and more into my life you see what he was like know now the poor spirit that was hidden in that splendid body but compared to my husband he seemed like the angel gabriel he pitied me and helped me till at last our intimacy turned to love deep deep passionate love such love as had dreamed of but never hoped to feel my husband suspected it but think that he was coward as well as bully and that leonardo was the one man that he was afraid of he took revenge in his own way by torturing me more than ever one night my cries brought leonardo to the door of our van we were near tragedy that night and soon my lover and understood that it could not be avoided my husband was not fit to live we planned that he should die leonardo had clever scheming brain it was he who planned it do not say that to blame him for was ready to go with him every inch of the way but should never have had the wit to think of such plan we made club leonardo made it and in the leaden head he fastened five long steel nails the points outward with just such spread as the lion paw this was to give my husband his deathblow and yet to leave the evidence that it was the lion which we would loose who had done the deed it was pitchdark night when my husband and went down as was our custom to feed the beast we carried with us the raw meat in zinc pail leonardo was waiting at the corner of the big van which we should have to pass before we reached the cage he was too slow and we walked past him before he could strike but he followed us on tiptoe and heard the crash as the club smashed my husband skull my heart leaped with joy at the sound sprang forward and undid the catch which held the door of the great lion cage and then the terrible thing happened you may have heard how quick these creatures are to scent human blood and how it excites them some strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that human being had been slain as slipped the bars it bounded out and was on me in an instant leonardo could have saved me if he had rushed forward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it but the man lost his nerve heard him shout in his terror and then saw him turn and fly at the same instant the teeth of the lion met in my face its hot filthy breath had already poisoned me and was hardly conscious of pain with the palms of my hands tried to push the great steaming bloodstained jaws away from me and screamed for help was conscious that the camp was stirring and then dimly remembered group of men leonardo griggs and others dragging me from under the creature paws that was my last memory mr holmes for many weary month when came to myself and saw myself in the mirror cursed that lion oh how cursed him not because he had torn away my beauty but because he had not torn away my life had but one desire mr holmes and had enough money to gratify it it was that should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by none and that should dwell where none whom had ever known should find me that was all that was left to me to do and that is what have done poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to die that is the end of eugenia ronder we sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her story then holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand with such show of sympathy as had seldom known him to exhibit poor girl he said poor girl the ways of fate are indeed hard to understand if there is not some compensation hereafter then the world is cruel jest but what of this man leonardo never saw him or heard from him again perhaps have been wrong to feel so bitterly against him he might as soon have loved one of the freaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion had left but woman love is not so easily set aside he had left me under the beast claws he had deserted me in my need and yet could not bring myself to give him to the gallows for myself cared nothing what became of me what could be more dreadful than my actual life but stood between leonardo and his fate and he is dead he was drowned last month when bathing near margate saw his death in the paper and what did he do with this fiveclawed club which is the most singular and ingenious part of all your story can not tell mr holmes there is chalkpit by the camp with deep green pool at the base of it perhaps in the depths of that pool well well it is of little consequence now the case is closed yes said the woman the case is closed we had risen to go but there was something in the womans voice which arrested holmes attention he turned swiftly upon her your life is not your own he said keep your hands off it what use is it to anyone how can you tell the example of patient suffering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to an impatient world the woman answer was terrible one she raised her veil and stepped forward into the light wonder if you would bear it she said it was horrible no words can describe the framework of face when the face itself is gone two living and beautiful brown eyes looking sadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful holmes held up his hand in gesture of pity and protest and together we left the room two days later when called upon my friend he pointed with some pride to small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece picked it up there was red poison label pleasant almondy odour rose when opened it prussic acid said exactly it came by post send you my temptation will follow your advice that was the message think watson we can guess the name of the brave woman who sent it
