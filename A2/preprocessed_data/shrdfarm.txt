shrewd farmer story once upon time there lived farmer who worked far from his home in the fields of rich baron in the past gangs of bandits hid in the mountains rising behind the plain but the emperor had sent his soldiers to find and kill the thieves and now the area was safe and quiet every once in while however old weapons from past battles could be found in the fields while he was chopping stump one day the farmer found bag full of gold the farmer had only ever seen silver coins in his life and he was so astonished to find all that gold that when he started walking home it was already dark on his way home the farmer thought about the problems that this sudden wealth could cause him first of all everything found on the baron territory belonged to the baron by law the farmer had to hand the gold over to the baron the farmer decided that it was much more fair for him to keep the treasure because he was very poor rather than giving it to the baron who already had lot of money he realized the risk he would run if anyone found out about his luck he would never tell anyone of course but his wife had reputation for talking too much and she would never keep secret sooner or later he would end up in jail he thought the problem over and over until he found solution before getting home he left the bag full of gold in bush next to some pine trees and the day after instead of going to work he went by the village to buy few nice trout some doughnuts and rabbit in the afternoon he went home and said to his wife get your wicker basket and come with me yesterday it rained and the wood is full of mushrooms we must get to them before someone else does the wife who loved mushrooms picked up her basket and followed her husband when they got to the woods the farmer ran to his wife shouting look look we have found doughnut tree and he showed her the branches he previously loaded with doughnuts the wife was astonished but she was even more puzzled when instead of mushrooms she found trout in the grass the farmer laughed happily today is our lucky day my grandfather said that everyone has one lucky day we might even find treasure in addition to being gossip the farmer wife was also sucker so she believed her husband and repeated while looking around this is our lucky day this is our lucky day the basket of the woman was full of fish by now when she and her husband reached the banks the farmer ran ahead of her looked into the thicket and said yesterday laid out my nets and want to check whether ve caught any fish or shrimps few minutes later the wife heard the husband shout run and see what ve caught what extraordinary luck ve fished rabbit they were walking back home and the wife kept talking excitedly about the great dinner with the doughnuts the fish and the rabbit the husband said let go by the wood again we could find other doughnuts they went to the spot where the farmer had hidden his gold coins the farmer pretended to find something look over here there strange bag and it full of gold this is an enchanted forest we found the doughnuts on the trees then we found the trout in the grass and now gold the poor woman was so excited that tears filled her eyes she could not utter another word and gulped as she touched the shiny coins at home after dinner neither of the two could fall asleep the farmer and his wife kept getting up to look over the treasure they had hidden in an old boot the day after the farmer went back to work but first said to his wife do nt tell anybody about what happened yesterday and he repeated the same recommendation every day after that pretty soon however the entire village had heard about the treasure the farmer and his wife were called by the baron and when they went in to see him the farmer tried to stand behind his wife his wife at the request of the baron spoke first of the doughnuts then of the trout on the grass and lastly of the rabbit in the river meanwhile behind her the husband kept tapping his forehead with his finger and gesticulating to the baron the baron began looking at the woman with pity and then bet you found treasure too that right sir the woman said the baron turned to the farmer and tapping his finger on his forehead sympathetically said see what you mean unfortunately have the same problem with my wife the farmers were sent home and no one believed their story and so the shrewd farmer did nt go to jail and spent his money wisely
