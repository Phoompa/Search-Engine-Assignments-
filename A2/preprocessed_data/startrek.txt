startrek the ultimate good morning my name is mister spock science officer of the uss enterprise collector of rare antarean tentacle flutes lead singer with the sex phasers promulgator of interspecies harmony and holder of the vulcan boy scout in logic second class this is my day am woken up by the captain reading his log over the pa at stardate 630 am we re supposed to get liein on sundays but as there precredits crisis going on well be racking up some overtime this month the enterprise is stranded in the hole in the middle of giant space doughnut that needs our dilithium crystals for sugar frosting by five to seven the captain has confused it with speech about the essential good nature of humanity complete with extensive footnotes from the american constitution it goes away in disgust and go back to bed get up at 1130am dial breakfast of coffee croissants and bowl of martian slimewarts washed down with quart of exotic klingon pantherpiss decide not to bother shaving my eyebrows put on the stupid plastic ears that starfleet forces all its science officers to wear crawl down to the bridge for another fun filled exciting day it quiet we re only on yellow alert which is just as well could nt handle that stupid siren going whoopwhoop this early in the morning it seems we ve come across planet that should nt be there so all the important members of the crew plus three security officers from the disposable dork section beam down the ship if left under the sterling command of tibbles the ship cat since all the captain does all day is play with his swivel chair and sing the starspangled banner the cat makes an ideal substitute on the planet rocky surface which my highly sensitive instruments tell me is 20 yards square and made of plastic though do nt tell the captain this kirk realises that he forgotten to put his ridiculous tracksuit bottoms on and goes back to the ship to get them by the time he returns the three disposable dorks have died mysteriously and bloody mccoy has had the chance to say he dead jim three times always offended by the way people call me jim of course my vulcan first name is unpronounceable but does anybody call me up and say hey unpronounceable how about we cruise the space port have few rigellian beers and get laid no its always mr spock why do nt you let your ears down for while the captain gets back the planet is inhabited by vicious man eatingmonster beautiful girl in glitter make up and an alien who dresses up in historical costumes left over from some other series this week it the sheriff of nottingham primitive earthling who liked to rob the poor to feed the rich so understand the captain quotes more of the constitution gets off with the girl and kills the monster while the rest of us sit around looking worried and putting on our toenail polish we beam back to the ship have little joke and all fall about the place as we are zapped by klingons the little console in the corner that supposed to shoot out sparks when we re attacked shoots out sparks ve been trying to get starfleet to put in seatbelts for years there an entire klingon battle fleet out there determined to cream us because captain kirk got klingon imperial high warbastard krudd daughter pregnant the dilithium crystals wonny take any more of this capn says mr scott over the intercom the hamster that works the little wheel that runs the impulse engines has died of heart attack och aye the noo hoots mon do nt know why he pretends to be scottish as the scots became extinct seven centuries ago but expect it go something to do with the fact that he an exnazi interplanetary arms dealer from tau ceti we asked the ship computer what to do and it replies you re such smartass pointyears you figure it out death is inevitable however figure it out and we escape go down to the gym and practise my vulcan combat moves have just perfected the most deadly fighting move in the universe the dreaded vulcan nosepinch guaranteed to get you out of tight situations without having to use any expensive special effects time for lunch in the enterprise canteen fish and chips apple pie and custard and more bloody slimwarts everybody laughs and tells dirty jokes do nt understand so raise one eyebrow and slope off for sulk from to 230 pm is my vulcan rutting season so watch out yesterday impregnated standup ashtray have this terrible urge to have sex with anything the captain calls by for friendly game of three dimensional chess after we ve finished our cigarettes the captain mind is taken over by an evil forcebeam coming from planet that was colonised 300 years ago by unwanted tv gameshow hosts he forces mr sulu to dress up as pink furry rabbit and tap dance mr chekov has to guess the price of the enterprise in roubles he loses and is dropped in vat of foam guess it correctly down to the kopeck but am disqualified because refuse to sing nellie the elephant in swahili backwards suggest that as solution we kill the captain realise there will be sideeffects but reckon can live with them however murder proves unnecessary after we blow up the planet with few photon torpedoes the captain returns to normal on the subspace radio we get distress call from the federation colony on planet porn the captain paces up and down while looks worried and asks lieutenant uhuru three times to verify this he has to repeat himself because every time she turns to him in her swivel chair he gets chance to look up her skirt eventually the captain orders us to proceed to the planet at warp factor constantly amazed by the miracle of science that allows us to travel at such frightening speeds on good day mr scott can get as much as 25 mph out of those engines as we approach the planet kirk orders mr chekov to put it up on the screen aye aye keptin say chekov and the same old football with blotchy bits painted on it flashes up in front of us planet porn is inhabited by men magazine editors millions of attractive young women and bunch of dribbling photographers two thirds of its surface area is covered by massive ocean of beer for reasons that are not entirely clear to me it is popular tourist resort with male humans we make audio contact with the planet chief administrator commander randy mackintosh who explains the problem they have been invaded by sinister race of intelligent marital aids vibrators are molesting the girls the blowup dolls are blowing up beneath their owners and huge amorphous mass of strawberry flavoured joyjelly is drinking all the beer calculate that they will have taken over the planet completely in 337485 hours precisely and everyone on the bridge throws things at me for being smartass further go on to suggest that the logical way of dealing with this major threat to the galaxy is to blow the planet to bits but will they listen to me oh no turn around to find that they ve already beamed down and that the captain has left me note saying that im to get the enterprise out of there and leave him behind if he not back by teatime too bad hey all get back in time having successfully dealt with this threat to civilization as we know it imagine that the captain must have confused the sex aids with dirty jokes from the american constitution in the evening go out and have fun fun fun at the staff recreation room we sink few jars do little differential calculus and all try to get off with lieutenant uhuru get drunk and sing old vulcan songs such as the pink hills of squidlblxx four and twenty virgins came down from zuxccrnch my baby was partially eaten by romulans and lost my heart to an organbank manageress everybody gets fed up with this and joe the bartender throws me out at stardate five past three go back to my room put on my et pyjamas drop my ears into glass of water and cry myself to sleep
