my lord aquith by yves barbero my lord aquith directs me to place these words on paper he insists that identify myself as the scribe men call me piplerian qnorcail veni my lord aquith laughs as he rolls my name about his tongue they gave you enough names to rule country was found fortyfour years ago in field came into this world deformed so my parents abandoned me this was nt cruelty but chance to give the gods an opportunity to correct their error they chose to do so by having lord aquith the elder my lord aquith father pass judgement that should live he gave me to the women of the keep to use according to their needs and my poor talents each of the eleven women offered the gods name for me denir the priest accepted each name and gave them form he called logical wise denir saw my eyes and pronounced me fit for education as scribe denir had wisdom that spoke of the elder gods although he wore the cloth of the usurper from the east the one patrick brought the god of death the one they call savior christ fear this god he has ambition he states that other gods are false state no god is false who makes himself felt denir would have understood with grin he adopted the cloth of the new god and let the water be splashed on his face patrick denir once told me had men with heavy swords at my baptism did nt want to be called to the bosom of this new god on that day so made do with his blessing instead but baptism is powerful protested and am good christian pip did nt take his holy water with closed heart still an ocean could not wash from me the ways of my fathers still carry the verse of law and the stories of old the old gods have not left me christ will simply have to share me with them he laughed shamelessly denir was old when was young he said he would face this christ and mediate his quarrel with the elder gods in the next world denir had no success as yet if may judge from the humorless monks who replaced him they have not the poetry or humor of the druid nor his learning of the law they act without precedent relying on unknown spirits rather than the law men no longer know how to behave these monks have only scribbling something if serve as an example any idiot may learn bless my lord aquith that these pages will be secret and can say my piece without fear of these dark monks these men of small learning despise me as know their craft without sharing their loyalties serve the elder gods in secret when they splashed the holy water on me was in this world but few days and so the baptism was less powerful and did not hold my soul they know but can not kill me my lord aquith protects me still the purpose of these pages is not served by my ramblings of the past it is the events of recent days that must be set down place my first lines only because my lord aquith thinks they will help those who are to come to under stand he has faith that these pages will be found in an age when we are both dust even the walls have their lifetimes there ll be time when these stones are removed and the iron chest will once again come before the eyes of men what sort of men will find it you re curious for scribe pip venture they ll be much like us wiser fear not cleverer perhaps with better tools but not wiser could see he was having private thoughts as he said it he broods at times ca nt presume to understand the meanderings of my betters he gives me much freedom in the strokes of this quill he knows understand the limits of his tolerance my lord aquith was presiding over the festival of the fall it has always been time of joy for the space of few days the drudgery of summer is replaced by mild weather and there is time for contemplation the poets are at their best just before the first snows and will recite for long hours before the fires of cool eves children born in this season are strong if they are boys and survive the winter at their weakest they become the good right arm of my lord aquith the common soldiers are always chosen from this stock if they are girls they will bear many children it good time under the rule of the elder gods do nt know what this christ will bring no comforting thoughts fear the festival was lit by seven huge fires set in the ancient pattern they lit the spirited dancing of the young if the old gods looked on all this with mirth the sexless monks from the east viewed the dancing with fierce and unforgiving glares but for the will of my lord aquith this ritual would be forbidden saw the future lord aquith standing among the monks his hair unnaturally cut with continence as stony as theirs may the gods preserve the child who has barely seen six summers seemed so joyful at birth now he is christ does dark generation cloud this keep they say christ walked the earth in the guise of man could he have been like his followers wonder if his judges were not correct in their judgement my lord aquith once executed man who was leading his followers in pattern of worship my lord aquith thought too rigid asked him why did not this man honestly worship the old gods surely the complaints of worthless monks was not reason enough to execute man you presume to judge my judgement he asked in playful manner he can be playful about his deepest feelings did not mean to presume to give offense truly sometimes forget my place he laughed do nt take offense of your sincere question pip nor should use my office to intimidate loyal servant forgive me readily sire he pondered for long moment there is type of man who traps himself in few ideas if he also carries the ability to lead others he becomes dangerous he ll challenge my rule first then that of the gods did nt completely understand and pressed my lord aquith had let it go he would have been truly angry with me he demands honest opinion and will not tolerate agreement for the sake of ambition or fear of beating do you think was unjust answer me honestly pip forgive me lord but where is the precedent all law is precedent and there is none for this thought you despised hetter he said of the executed man confess my hatred of hetter but can not see how he threatened you my lord aquith he was weak and too ill disposed to command soldiers my hate is not sufficient reason for his execution there must be precedent he nodded for crippled fool pip you ask hard questions of me the christians have supplied the precedent consider the christ at best he was worker of wood cabinet maker carpenter good skill highly valued and yet the priests sought his death for leading the people astray but now his followers have the ears of kings and the dear of the people my lord aquith saw that finally understood in the quiet that followed we shared the same thoughts watched the young dancers especially the women with envy and let my mind wonder back twentyfive years when shared the hay with minia it was my only time she was older by two summers and crippled of mind and think she was given coin by the elder lord aquith was his fool he fed me and provided she was of good disposition my lord aquith laughter behind me returned me to the present thinking of minia pip aye lord think of her too you were not the only one she introduced into the mysteries she was cruelly dealt with she was fond of throwing rocks at the soldiers who were expected to accept them with good humor gentle if playful demons possessed her one knight who had changed his name to sir paul on accepting the eastern god chose to torment her for her graciousness towards men minia would not be tormented her kindly demons would not allow it instead they showed her how to torment sir paul with smiles and loose garments and grab at certain moments and at certain parts making others including my lord aquith laugh at the knight redness of face she was found along the road with her throat cut the wound bore the mark of man who knew his trade denir said those years ago that the killer had used her forcefully two nights later heard screams from the tower man was being whipped his name is my lord aquith secret though know it to be paul knight of christ my lord aquith will neither confirm or deny my certain knowledge even now ten years after sir paul death and sixteen since denir made his way to the keep of christ to mediate for the old gods my certain knowledge came from the uncomfortable walk of sir paul the next day told denir of it and he mumbled sadly sir paul took an oath to christ if it was he who could not control his lust and he who would kill to hide his weakness in violation of the christian commandment his punishment was soft indeed why did he not give her gift of copper she was playful she also had tongue and lord aquith can not abide hypocrites if paul took an oath of chastity as foolish as such an oath is our lord aquith would expect him to keep it he murdered her to keep the secret if it was he oh that all men were like you pip my lord aquith gave me his cup drink quickly pip there will be another after that soon we ll all walk as you do his four knights sir cullier sir michael sir malyarn and sir asien all laughed only the sour monks kept their silence the mead went down roughly and was quickly drunk look monk shouted pointing to the sky sign from heaven we all looked up the shout came from truly frightened man the stars seemed to be growing and disappearing in silence the night was lighted up as if by lightning but the brief daylight was longer than lightning and there were no clouds or claps or rain the gods battle shouted aye pip sir malyarn answered nervously monk drew cross from his belt and held it out there is no god but christ heathen sir malyarn made the sign as he staggered back fearfully held my ground drink had made me brave that was foolish the monks would find an opportunity to flay me silence monk my lord aquith ordered back to your place the monk retreated but did not replace the cross in his belt what is it lord sir cullier shouted am seer to know the heavens we watched the silent battle only the roar of the seven fires could be heard everyone had fallen silent and looked upward soon it was over my lord aquith laughed are we to be frightened by the manifestations of the heavens he shouted for all to hear the gods too have their quarrels the knights joined in the laughter dance my lord aquith ordered be joyful least we displease the bountiful gods and they have cause to turn their terrible weapons on us the drum took up their rhythm and the dancing resumed my eyes were misted from drink but saw silver spear larger than the largest horse pass in front of me its shaft afire clap of thunder followed it an instant later it was louder than any thunder ever heard rough wind made the seven fires sway after the spear many fell to the ground from the force of this momentary storm or from fear drink and wind combined to cause of my falling felt my lord aquith firm hand pull me up and with his other hand he handed me my cripple stick what there nothing to dread my lord aquith said to my startled cry there was smaller clap of thunder in the distance the ground shook almost knocking me from my feet again but for the strong hand of my lord aquith in the far beyond the trees was light of unearthly glow after spell it disappeared dance came the cheerful command of my lord aquith the drums resumed their beat and the pipes took up the drone we watched the young people dance into the night and disappear into the mounds of hay drowsiness was creeping up on me in fact soon fell asleep in the bliss of mead sir cullier told me that it was my lord aquith himself who carried me to my straw below the kitchen remember the look on my lord aquith face before the slumber of mead took me into the shadows it was turned to the spot of the distant glow the smile disappeared frown formed and the eyes narrowed ii the days of september soon ended little happened except that was beaten one night by two monks as stepped from relieving myself had taken my cup of mead as was permitted me on sundays but was nt drunk still am old and my body seems in hurry to relieve itself the monk cowls hid their faces but knew them to be john and mark of the five my lord aquith is forced to tolerate it could only be them did nt complain to my lord aquith over this trifling incident it is the place of cripples to be beaten from time to time it only because sir cullier happened upon the scene that my lord aquith learned of the act sir cullier approached the monks and with the back of his gloved hand boxed their ears naturally they fled cowards he shouted after them he looked down on me who were those monks did not see their faces sire grin appeared on his face but you know who they are little cripple said nothing you fear their retribution very well have it your way he kicked my stick to me and left it not that sir cullier wanted to show me kindness he himself has booted my behind when was slow to react to his commands although he is more playful about it then cruel sir cullier has sense of the law and the law leaves punishment as the sole prerogative of the lord of the keep or fathers punishing children how long have these beatings been inflicted on you my lord aquith demanded of me the next morning all my life sire was trembling as stood before him not from fear of retribution from the monks but because held back from my lord aquith he had always looked to me for the keep whispers sir cullier is the shrewdest of my lord aquith four gentlemen at arms he knows who they are sire offered pip my protection am offended that he still fears them my lord aquith eyes narrowed do you accept sir cullier protection yes sire was trapped then name the monks he boomed john and mark my lord aquith had little choice in naming them did nt understand why my lord aquith made such display of the incident he knew that was beaten from time to time by the cooks or some soldier he never made fuss over those incidents but he ordered john and mark back to their bishop after giving them twenty lashes each in private later asked him why am not so important that you would anger the bishop you see only the surface pip if you saw more fully you be better instrument to me am the law here if you committed some offense and only must be the instrument of your punishment the church presumes to take my place in ordinary matters it needs to be taught its place but my lord aquith john and mark did nt beat me for some offense of the law but because they despise my learning and my teacher denir aye that true chose to see it another way since it of use to my policy he grinned think of the benefit it does us both the bishop will be more thoughtful because dared punish his agents and you little cripple are not likely to be beaten again twenty lashes to important monks is something the cooks will remember with that shared his grin it was the third day of october when the woman came before my lord aquith she came dragging her daughter behind her by the hair it took two guards to restrain the daughter was later told was sent for after few questions by my lord aquith pip take pen and paper and mark down our words monk jeromy protested we may do the task sire jeromy and martin were left to us after the banishment of mark and john old albert the fifth monk was in ill health and did not share the confidence of his younger brothers they suspected him of being secret druid he did nothing to contradict their suspicions he did nt care what they thought knowing full well that he be in christ keep before many weeks would pass silence monks sir cullier shouted placing hand on his scabbard jeromy knelt before my lord aquith sire this woman speaks of demons and out worldly fires surely this is the province of the church acknowledge your interest in this matter monk my lord aquith told him but want hand free of bias to write down her words you are free to copy pip lines later jeromy nodded and resumed his place speak women tell pip your name and that of your daughter the old woman spoke ve always been called boutha and my daughter is mary after the virgin tell you great lord that she is the first child to be named after the virgin in these parts was first in my village to acknow ledge the christ as my lord and savior it was eighteen years ago when was heavy with mary yes yes go on boutha my lord aquith gestured impatiently know you are woman of true virtue boutha eyes grew large picked up pen and ink it was the night the gods battled shared my bed with my husband tull and mary slept by the door why was nt mary here with the other young people she was wed last year why was she not with her husband jos is gone yes my lord aquith reflected remember now was he ever found no sire sir cullier supplied we think he was taken by the bog or thieving on some southern road my lord aquith added to general laughter he was wild one recall continue boutha horrible shriek came from mary it was so sudden that the guards were taken by surprise and let her go she ran for mother striking her cruelly about the head and shoulders surely she would have slain her mother if sir cullier had not acted swiftly and pulled the girl away mary turned her rage on my lord aquith retainer and bit him on the hand sir cullier made short work of her one blow from his free hand and she fell unconscious jeromy approached my lord aquith the girl is possessed it is church matter perhaps monk but so far am convinced only of quarrel within her family let the evidence unfold itself if it reveals concerns belonging to the church will allow you voice until then you will remain silent boutha was on her feet two marks were on her face and blood came from her lips let boutha be attended to my lord aquith ordered take mary and lock her firmly pip attend me followed my lord aquith and sir cullier to the chapel behind the great hall of the keep jeromy and martin followed us but sir cullier closed the heavy door of the chapel before they could enter saying something could not hear but which sent the monks angrily away my lord aquith approached the altar and bowed slightly to the iron cross with the figure of the eastern savior nailed firmly to it forgive me my lord christ but these matters concern you not he turned the heavy cross to the wall sensed sarcasm in his words and action my lord aquith turned to sir cullier would have your counsel my most honest of retainers my lord aquith used the words blunt and honest interchangeably twenty strokes for the girl sire ten for striking her mother and ten for striking me fair punishment sir cullier it will be executed he rubbed his bearded chin but there is something else want your thoughts on something of more pressing moment do you think demons are involved know not sire know only that when family is in the midst of quarrel large and regrettable claims are made my lord aquith nodded in agreement the curse of such claims is that they divide villages and unless wisdom is applied quickly the wildest of imaginings come forth and deaths quickly follow do nt wish to see my people killing each other he turned to me your eyes are full of questions pip shifted nervously before you arrived at the hall pip wild charges of fire coming from mary finger were spoken jeromy and martin immediately concluded possession look for more mundane explanation with those words my lord aquith produced metal object from his tunic and placed it in my hand what make you of this ve never seen its like my lord it was of polished metal such as fine silver but without the weight of the precious metal one end was hollow and the other had grip angled from the tube and very comfortable to the hand in the angle between the grip and the tube was framed space with small piece of metal inviting finger dared not touch it for fear of the magic boutha called it wand her husband took it from the girl sir cullier approached me and took the wand was pleased to be rid of it it has the feel of weapon sire perhaps small arrow thrown from the tube but see no mechanism for winding it and it looks too small to cause harm unless it involves poison without another thought sir cullier gripped the thing his finger touching the small metal piece fire in long straight path issued noiselessly from the tube and touched the metal cross on the altar the cross glowed briefly crackling as it turned color smithy sees and fell melted to the stone altar sir cullier eyes widened it was the first time saw surprise on his face he examined the thing and carefully avoided pointing it at any body my lord aquith rubbed the bald spot on his brow thought fully we shall take care with that he took the proffered wand from his retainer and regarded it carefully your guess is correct sir cullier it is weapon wonder how it contains the fire there is demon within it sire sir cullier offered with heavy breath it mindless demon if he be there my lord aquith observed inclined more to curiosity than fear it serves whoever pulls the triggering rod perhaps it the same demon which resides in any good bow he replaced the wand in his tunic it attacked symbol of christ said sensible choice my lord aquith ventured sarcastically but think that if it had been pointed at you it would have attacked you are you afraid pip aye my lord aquith you were always sensible with your fears pip let go find this demon of mary and see if he is sensible we left the next morning iii the party was equipped for war my lord aquith and sir cullier led on their chargers followed by the other retainers those of us on foot eight soldiers myself the woman boutha and her daughter with jeromy and martin behind them and four more soldiers to guard our rear slowed the procession to slow walk it would take us most of the morning to get to boutha village the roads were little more than wagon tracks in the country north of the keep because of the shortness of the journey we took only what supplies we could carry and left the carts behind wish we had left the monks behind and even ventured to suggest it to my lord aquith he gave me only knowing grin and said nothing to my suggestion as he checked the straps of his saddle and mounted the war horse it was quiet journey mary hands were tied behind her back with stout rope another rope at her feet was long enough to allow her to walk but not so long that she might run away the monks mumbled their prayers for her soul as they took unhurried strides behind her the morning fog had lifted and it was getting warm my bones did nt ache that day it was good sign thanked the sprites of the forest softly so jeromy could not hear after our talk in the chapel my lord aquith sir cullier and myself had gone to speak to mary without telling the monks but for my lord aquith orders would not write the words which followed this is mary tale the demon is without hair and is covered with bruises his complexion is fair whiter than any man have ever seen and he does nt smell he has no hair on his chest or legs how know you this sir cullier demanded she shrieked he is my lover and such lover no woman has ever had he is larger than any man have ever seen she laughed madly and astounded us with descriptions had never before heard issue from woman mouth even the common soldiers with their ribald tales would never speak as she did my lord aquith listened calmly he kept his thoughts private as he often tells me silence is an ally people assume you agree with them if you pay close heed and say naught finally my lord aquith took out the wand and asked how did you get this the demon slept and took it saw him chase the men away with it using it so the fire burned the ground before them or the trees around their heads saw him kill wolf that came into his camp but he let you in his camp aye am woman and often consort with the wood sprites walk into the woods with my breasts bared and my tongue licking my lips sprites and men know what that means she opened her dress and revealed herself could take all three of you at once and would restore your clothes girl my lord aquith said coldly we are not demons or sprites and you hold no appeal for us she laughed and closed her dress know great secret she seemed to chant it and repeated it three times while doing dance what is this secret my lord aquith asked speaking calmly as friend might speak before the men were the women once we ruled the old gods speak of it we controlled men with our passions but then came iron it was given men by jealous male gods men subdued the great mother with iron iron stays stiff when men can not trembled but took comfort in the wisdom of my lord aquith in keeping the monks from this interrogation surely even my lord aquith could not prevent her burning if the severe monks heard of this did the demon tell you this she gave sinister smile the demon speaks tongue only understand he speaks to his iron and the iron comes alive what does he say to his iron my lord aquith examined his ring of office showing no concern as he spoke have seen him do this when he wished to make as if indifferent that my secret it will be my secret my secret my secret she chanted and resumed her dance think you lie mary you do nt speak the demon tongue you want only to increase your importance in our eyes she pointed finger at my lord aquith am not man and care naught for importance she chanted circling about us in her suggestive dance am the earth without me there is no ground for the importance of men to stand ve seen the other world ve seen the other world heaven sir cullier asked hell she shrieked it far better place the great mother rules there calm as ever my lord aquith asked where is this hell the gate is with my lover he guards it with his living iron why would the great mother tolerate gate of iron to her paradise and use male demon larger than men as guard my lord aquith was fond of using logic to befuddle the girl mary ignored the thrust you need only see the camp to see that it is the gate to hell he has cleared the forest with his magic and fire dug trench the length of hundred men in the middle he has planted tree of iron it gleams in the moonlight and small steady fires issue from its heart they light and go out without the agency of men demons whisper from the tree the fires are cold to the touch but light the tree with more brightness than the moon tell me more do nt wish to go and ask the demon yourself if you dare perhaps it is time that do my lord aquith decided that nothing useful could be unearthed from this evil child and had her locked away for the night he placed guard at her door with instructions that no one should enter save me with her meal if jeromy or martin came down this passage they were to be chased away preferably with good swift kick the guard my lord aquith picked had no trouble understanding returned shortly after with bread and cheese and some mead and entered the cell to find mary in the shadows hiding from me but issuing cruel laugh placed the bowl and cup on the floor and began walking backwards so she could not jump out and surprise me not that could do much she was young woman if frenzied in good health and could most certainly tear me apart before the guard could come to aide me she suddenly came out of the shadows naked to the air she leered at me moving her tongue back and forth was more than willing to believe she was possessed by some christian demon first she tempts you and then requires feelings of guilt because you listened to the temptation was frozen in place for moment but gathered my senses and ran out of the cell to this day can still feel trace of pain in my abused legs closed the door swiftly and dropped the wood in place heard mocking laughter had dropped my stick when ran and knew would not see it till the morrow the guard flanor looked at me in amazement he never seen me move so quickly nor my face so drained of color he never been friend to me but he had always granted me my peace he did not mock me and could not fault him did you see the demon nodded do nt open the door for your life sake he took out some mistletoe and kissed it iv we arrived at the village as the sun was almost directly overhead it was deserted signs of burned huts were all about it mary work boutha shouted she did it with the wand she burned her father hand it no longer serves him my lord aquith rode back to where boutha stood go and tell the villagers to come out of hiding they are under my protection boutha ran in the space of an hour she had gathered most of the villagers including her husband who hid his hand in crude bandage my lord aquith looked at tull and remembered him tull was speaker for this village and met with the lord of the keep at least twice year but tull was common name for men in these parts and think that my lord aquith did not know he was this tull until his eyes rested on him since these pages must be honest on my lord aquith instruction must add that he now often forgets the faces of those he does not see every day in others this is fault but my lord aquith occupies himself with weighty matters and will not behave as common man although hasten to add he was not always so grave man it is only in the four years since my lady aquith fell from her favorite mount to the next world that he moves into forgetful moods it took the strength of sir cullier and four soldiers to stay my lord aquith sword from the neck of the white mare how fare you tull my lord aquith boomed to the peasant speaker my hand is useless and my daughter is the one who did it tull said this in the same tone as he would argue for his village share of the harvest the sense of righteousness was there but his speech lacked passion will punish her tull unless you as her sire claim that right for yourself will leave the punishment to you my lord aquith ca nt raise hand against my own child sir cullier rode foreword perhaps if you had exercised your paternal duties she would not have consorted with demons she deserves death for striking her sire tull lowered his head plead you not to strike her dead sir knight sir cullier looked at my lord aquith for judgement thirty lashes added to the twenty sir cullier aye my lord if sir cullier seemed unhappy with this mild sentence it was because my lord aquith own law prevented this sentence from being carried out at once it would have to be divided over the space of three days no more than twenty lashes day were allowed want to break the act not the spirit my lord aquith had explained in changing the policy of his father my lord aquith dismounted he placed his arm around the speaker we will talk tull come pip he looked at sir cullier indicating with his eyes that his lieutenant should stay outside the good knight knew his lord tactic to loosen tull tongue he would leave most displays of power outside followed them into the mean hut tell me what occurred here honest tull my lord aquith said as he sat on basket of grain placed myself on the dirt floor and took out my inks to write it was the night of the harvest festival we were satiated as it is your policy not to count what is eaten that night in your share know my policies my lord aquith said with mock gravity continue we had just gone to sleep when we heard loud noise it was as daylight outside stepped from the hut followed by boutha and mary in the forest was fire so gathered the men to go and put out the fire it was dry as you may remember and we were fearful of its spread we ran to the fire with buckets hoping against hope that the spring nearby was not dry in my heart knew it to be dry but by the time we arrived there was no fire the woods were full of noises like voices speaking from invisible places we were all fearful but and some brave lads advanced anyway we came to place clearing that was nt there before but seemed to be scooped out by the hand of giant god it was black and there were still small fires about ordered the men to put them out as we entered the clearing we saw metal tree smooth and twisted like no tree should be it had been uprooted and was lying on its side out of hole in the tree emerged the demon fire came from his finger we fled my lord aquith nodded very wise why did nt you come to me at once we were fearful that you lash us and accuse us of taking sprite herbs for their powerful dreams as did four harvests ago yes my lord the harvest festivals bring on many strange manifestations what did this demon look like he has the form of man could see that well in the moonlight his coloring was strange hue like metal and he was naked some of the lads thought he was dressed but that his clothing was tight on his frame he had no hair continue tull there little more to tell my lord aquith it been the habit of this village not to inquire too deeply into the affairs of the gods virtuous habit tell me about mary she disappeared from the village that night silence followed my lord aquith let the silence fill the hut he is skilled at questioning after time he said tull am not seeking to punish only punish deceit and you have offered none as yet reward truth even unpleasant truth you know that your village has my protection and the priests will keep them from you and yours did you search for mary tull dropped to his knees and blubbered you did nt search for her why not know you have affection for your unworthy child the forest controls her she belongs to the old gods but simple man perhaps not so simple were you not worried that she might be hurt and need attending no my lord food would disappear we knew it was her has she done this before he nodded trembling we thought jos would control her he was strong she drove him away or or killed him my lord aquith supplied and since then no one has taken firm hand to her for fear of her magical powers tull silence had the look of agreement tell me about the night she returned with the wand of fire tull looked around to me pip is my creature good tull he is sworn to silence and bears no love for the priests of the eastern god tell me hold nothing back was asleep the smell of fire woke me then there shouts and strange sounds left my bed to find confusion in the middle of the confusion mary was shrieking with demonic laughter at first thought the fire came from finger then saw the wand walked up from behind her and took hold of the wand my hand was in pain but had it and threw it from her that was courageous tull it was the proper thing to do struck my daughter in fury fury you did nt know you possessed he nodded you know my heart my lord we strapped her to post the next morning we tied her hands firmly and made knots on her legs so she could not run away boutha brought her to you boutha thought it best my lord aquith rose am glad you are speaker of this village you have great wisdom and boutha is blessing to your house thank you my lord remove the bandage tull would examine the wound tull did as he was told two fingers were missing and he could not move the others ve seen such injuries before tull have applied fires to seal wounds in battle you will live to fine old age ll have my smith make you hook so you may do honorable labor the speaker nodded in gratitude such services are beyond his means lead me to this demon but my lord he is manifestation of the harvest time then lead me to the place he may choose to manifest himself to the lord of the keep as companions my lord aquith took sir cullier sir michael and the bowman odounille he left the rest to guard the village went as his chronicler to the consternation of jeromy and martin who insisted on coming to protect the interest of the church thought my lord aquith too eager to have them along he was plotting so kept my own counsel it was dusk when we arrived at the demon camp could sense the fear amongst us we heard whispers voices in language known only to the gods only my lord aquith and sir cullier seemed fearless they had faced foes from the north horned men with the faces of bears know that the horns and faces are masks to strike fear into their enemies but it also true that the men of the north took on the spirits of the monsters they killed for their coloring do you think the demon has another wand asked in whisper own more than one sword he has more than one wand the horses were left behind and we approached with stealth there was bright glow coming from the demon camp it did nt come from campfire there was an unnatural air about it saw the unearthly camp admit on my belly with bushes for cover ve never been known for my bravery the scene was as the christians describe the world of the damned even the shrubbery at the border of the camp was wilted in poisoned death what sort of god kills growing things the land did seem plowed by some giant fiery hand the metal tree was twisted only as an evil entity might express malice the glow was coming from two globes on metal posts then we saw the demon in the eerie light he seemed naked but soon saw that he had clothing it fit tightly about his body and he carried long wand half the length of spear heard voices from behind me they were whispers return to the village tull you ve served me well yes my lord he seemed gladdened by the order the whisper of jeromy next filled my ears he is demon lord do you propose to fight him brother jeromy or will you leave that to me the choice is yours there was silence for spell well jeromy can your christ conquer this demon he was baiting the monk saw his purpose will cast it out jeromy whispered firmly well and good jeromy will bide while you do your work understood the scheme from his tone my lord aquith saw the demon as warrior not spirit he was using the demon to rid himself of these troublesome monks my lord aquith sensed this demon as viking spirit come to threaten the people of the keep not an evil manifestation at all my heart fluttered as saw jeromy and martin leave the cover of the trees and advance cross in hand ready yourself odounille my lord aquith whispered if the christ fails us would trust the spirit that guides your sure hand he was employing sarcasm again odounille said small prayer to the tree from which his shaft sprang the demon saw jeromy and martin approach in loud voice they muttered their latin striking more fear in me fear than in the demon how many times has my lord aquith told me that latin moves men not mountains and still tremble at its pronouncement how foolish of me denir said it was merely another tongue and taught it to me scribble it but fear to speak it it belongs to the dreaded savior in its spoken form stand ready but hold your place bowman my lord aquith whispered conspiratorially we must give brother jeromy his chance the demon turned swiftly at the approach of the dark monks perhaps he mistook them for wild animals dressed as they were in their brown habits perhaps he knew what they represented perhaps he thought the iron cross weapon can not tell he raised his wand and pointed it toward jeromy if jeromy had stopped believe the creature would not have loosed the fury of the weapon upon him he had only chased men away before jeromy chest burst into flame and the monk was thrown violently back and clearly killed his face frozen in astonished death martin dropped his cross and ran the demon made no effort to chase him now bowman odounille loosed his arrow it found its mark in the demon shoulder the demon let out cry and fell backwards from the force dropping the long wand have never seen odounille err by so much as an inch and yet he only wounded the demon before could think my lord aquith and sir cullier ran to the fallen creature and prevented him from recovering his wand by placing the blades of their broadswords to the throat if the demon moved he would be dead sir michael watched where his master could nt in the event another demon lurked in the dark pip my lord aquith shouted come here ran to him look at his eyes pip is this demon stuttered and cleared my throat as looked at the darting fearful eyes no my lord aquith he is man misshapen as am but man indeed his ears were too small for his head and of an odd shape his skin was unnaturally white but the eyes told all aside from their red color they belonged to man martin came up demon lord aquith it is demon strike it dead my lord aquith struck martin with the back of his mailed hand you left your brother and dropped the sign of your god you feared that the promised paradise was an empty claim you have no faith among us you no longer have voice go back to your bishop and report what happened take care that you report honestly or you will fear my wrath promise you martin that your kind will no longer trouble me martin fled my lord aquith said could no longer restrain myself why did you not use his own wand against him you bear it in your tunic he laughed politics pip if had used the demon weapon in the sight of the monks the church would charge me and would burn could resist the combined force of my enemies if they were given the blessing of the church to steal my lands blinked he stooped and looked me directly in the face all is politics my friend even the capture of demons regarded the now helpless creature odounille was applying herbs and bandages to the demon wound you did nt kill by choice firmly odounille said never miss overhearing my query my lord aquith supplied if fear of the unknown were crime deserving of death would have to kill not only this creature but all of us this poor individual is only guilty of being in strange country where even the elements seem hostile the bowman obeys my will and his corruption of mary stammered think it was the reverse pip for her crimes mary will be lashed and sent to nunnery to serve her namesake and jeromy death engineered that the sin is on my soul not this poor demon shall excuse it as political necessity for my conscience sake jeromy and his brothers were ready to put people to the torch want none of that in my lands undoubtedly it will cause me some financial pain since the bishop is greedy man he is not like his patron patrick thank the gods who was fanatic greed is useful political tool for curing disputes which could otherwise become violent at last we will be free of these troublesome monks sir cullier added still guarding the creature with his exposed blade my lord aquith placed his hand on the shoulder of his comradeatarms wish that were so old friend venture to guess that these christians will plague us again in few years time do you judge this creature as faultless then ventured merely luckless pip not faultless look at him he is wounded soldier left to die by his retreating fellows his one crime in my eyes is that he was careless with his weapon and caused my people harm had any died at mary hand he would have died with her on the gallows but none did so their lives are saved the arrow has made his arm useless and is punishment enough for warrior my lord aquith turned to sir michael gather party of villagers and cover the metal vessel with earth until the trees grow back this place is forbidden aye lord vessel repeated he was sailor of the skies using the stars as harbors now he is as earthbound as we his people have great knowledge and can create great works still do nt think they are gods or demons they have too many of the same qualities we have fear lust war and despair vi even as write these final lines look from the window to see the demon sitting in the courtyard he is morose and searching the heavens in false hope for the last several days his bonds have been removed and the guards ignore him there no place for him to go he eats little and shows no interest in those around him he makes no effort to learn our speech and says little in his if the women had nt thrown blanket over his shoulders he would have no protection against the lightly falling snow when he does speak the speech is directed at himself he is pitiful and fear he will soon die he knows he is abandoned my lord aquith says as he looks over my shoulder man who can not adjust himself to the situation at hand has naught but my contempt pip he is less than man you dear pip are true man fate gave you poor legs and deformed back and you re burdened with the contempt of the unthinking yet you go on you serve useful life he places his hand on my shoulder and walks to the wall to prepare the mortar which will seal these words and the two demon weapons firmly in the keep copyright 1987 by yves barbero 4152854358 1073 dolores street san francisco ca 94110 yes you are welcome to download this story for your
