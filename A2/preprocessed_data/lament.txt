offender e477439 lament dear sir outside it windy and the rain is coming down and everywhere wintry gloom has fallen on the town but here at number the clouds are heavier sure because last night rode upon the wrong side of the law guess you see these letters come and go like autumn leaves endearing supplications to be gathered into sheaves and sorted for the rubbish bin wherein the sergeants toss those letters from inebriates who think they re sterling moss but pause for just moment sir to read this turgid verse an endeavour to preserve the meagre contents of my purse for many years held licence classed both and and rode my old threefifty twixt the mountains and the sea lived amid the hawarden hills where roads are laid with stone where winter on motorbike can chill you to the bone but then moved to southland about three years ago where temperatures the whole year round are exceptionally low left my bike in hawarden in shed of lucerne hay the hens perched on the handlebars by night the owls by day and by and by as time rolled on the southland lost its charm and came back to canterbury and visited the farm my bike was how left it though of course it had acquired half pound of guano and its licence had expired and now have new address garage of my own place to store that motorbike until the kids have grown but how to get it down from there was causing me to frown it many long and lonesome hours through weka pass to town have morris minor but doubt if it could tow trailer full of motorbike for fifty miles or so could strap it to raft and float it down the hurunui then sail round to the avon and upstream to papanui with brandnew registration and licence it breeze but that consumeth money and it does nt grow on trees for just one ride one little ride what chances could there be of encountering an agent of the dreaded mot cleaned my fullface helmet visor carefully with meths then worried lest you stop me and the smell was on my breath donned my motley welding gloves and pulled my parka tight and prayed the looming clouds would not precipitate tonight then while the shadows lengthened with the waning of the sun crept out of waikari on to highway number one and all the way the rain came down steady humid blight and all the way feared to see those cars of black and white and all the way watched the numbers running on the dial as each tarsealed kilometre marked threefifths of mile from waipara to amberley did nt stop to eat as water ran inside my boots and down around my feet from woodend to the motorway never paused in flight but hold the greying silhouette of cashmere in my sight passed above the waimak which is presently infested with salmon on their westward run to waters less congested perhaps thought salmon steak is waiting on the dish when arrive at number to dine upon smoked fish then belfast styx and redwood and my home just up ahead and my mind began to fix on things like cheese and garlic bread too late saw the officers astanding in row too late saw the checkpoint and their torches all aglow now officer healey saw me slip in by the kerb behind commer van where could park quite unobserved and officer healey is quite an asset to the law for he can spot guilty conscience at hundred yards or more hoisted on my tramping pack preparing for walk while officer healey swooped as quiet as hawk and as turned to leave the scene heard voice exclaim my goodness sir your bike seems quite unlicensed please explain so there stood as culpable as guy fawkes so to speak or those two foreign saboteurs alain and dominique but here like to draw small distinction if might my actions while impulsive on that damp and dreary night were not the reckless kind that might endanger you or me but designed to get my motorbike here expeditiously there not lot that could say by way of mitigation ve never found myself before in quite this situation so when the bailiff comes to call aknocking at the door and they put me in concrete room with straw upon the floor and when my case is heard and lost and they call the firing squad and march me to the wall along the far end of the quad and as smoke the cigarette and the prison chaplain prays will they charge me for the blindfold in these times of user pays sam mahon re offence no e477439 dear sir outside it sunny and the clouds are far away and everywhere the summer sun is brightening the day and here on floor two things are brighter now than ever cos on my desk there chance did fall very clever letter you re right sir letters fly in here and you can be quite sure that most are short cos more like yours never could endure good grief my man who do you think should have to pay the price when you re the one who did the wrong when riding on your bike your story is when one first looks most understandable and can see that problem rise quite unpredictable but surely with brain like yours much practised writing verse you could have thought way around not made your problem worse know that mr lange mates have closed the pos down and that for you the nearest one might be far away in town but surely you this poet quick could write note and ask the licence to be sent to you it not an odious task but then cast my mind back quite some years when yet in school and did wrong and teacher said come here you little fool your penalty sure like mine was writing out some lines should one suppose then in this case you should forego your fine but wait see there more to it no licence for the bike but you sir have nt got one too the thought gives you fright so now
