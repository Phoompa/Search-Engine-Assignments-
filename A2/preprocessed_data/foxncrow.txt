the fox and the crow once upon time big crow stole lump of cheese and went to perch on branch of tree to eat it in peace passing fox sniffed the air and stopped below the tree his mouth watering cheese he said mmm love if only could he said to himself greedily wondering how to get hold of the morsel after moment or two he spoke to the crow you are fine crow ve never seen anyone so big and strong what lovely thick shiny feathers you have and such slender legs the sign of noble bird and regal beak that it the beak of king you ought to be crowned king of the birds when the crow heard such glowing praise of his beauty he stretched to his full length and triumphantly flapped hls wlngs in his softest voice the fox went on what lovely eyes you have you do nt seem to have single fault you re quite perfect the crow had never been flattered so much in all his life though have nt heard your voice yet went on the fox expect that such perfect creature like yourself can have nothing less than wonderful singing voice the crow had till then been blissfully drinking in the fox praise but he felt prick of doubt at the sweet words about his voice he had never heard that crows were fine singers of course being very fine crow perhaps that meant he had beautiful voice as well the fox could be right and the crow gazed down at the fox as he said now then king of the birds let me hear sweet song throwing caution to the winds the crow opened his beak and taking deep breath loudly cawed cra cra cra the lump of cheese fell through the air and the fox caught it neatly in his jaws deserved that he told himself as he enjoyed the titbit then licking his lips he again spoke to the crow on the branch silly crow you re the ugliest bird ve ever seen you have the worst voice ve ever heard but most of all you re the most stupid bird ve ever met and thanks for the cheese and off he trotted well satisfied with hlmself
