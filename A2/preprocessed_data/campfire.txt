this is copy of the winning story submitted to the campfire stories contest and it comes from the great state of texas and won the week prize of 25000 from snohomish insights via vancouver ostomy highlife note for best effect read this aloud to group of or more my friend is rather oldfashioned lady always quite delicate and elegant especially in her language she and her husband were planning week vacation in florida so she wrote to particular campground and asked for reservations she wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped but didnt quite know how to ask about the toilet facilities she just couldnt bring herself to write the word toilet in her letter after much deliberation she finally came up with the oldfashioned term bathroom commode but when she wrote that down she still thought she was being too forward so she started all over again rewrote the entire letter and referred to the bathroom commode merely as the bc does the campground have its own bc is what she actually wrote well the campground owner was nt oldfashioned at all and when he got the letter he just could nt figure out what she was talking about that bc business really stumped him after worrying about it for while he showed the letter to several campers but they could nt imagine what the lady meant either so the campground owner finally coming to the conclusion that the lady must be talking about the location of the local baptist church sat down and wrote the following reply dear madam regret very much the delay in answering your letter but now take the pleasure of informing you that bc is located nine miles north of the campground and is capable of seating 250 people at one time admit it is quite distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly but no doubt you will be pleased to know that great many people take their lunches along and make day of it they usually arrive early and stay late the last time my wife and went was six years ago and it was so crowded we had to stand up the whole time we were there it may interest you to know that right now there is supper planned to raise money to buy more seats they re going to hold it in the basement of the bc would like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly but it surely is not lack of desire on our part as we grow older it seems to be more of an effort particularly in cold weather if you decide to come down to our campground perhaps could go with you the first time you go sit with you and introduce you to all the other folks remember this is friendly community sincerely
