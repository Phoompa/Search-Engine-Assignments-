ugly reminder of two thousand dollars in back taxes had never paid was on unemployment two years ago and could nt pay my taxes had to file without paying let it slide the irs did nt call me did nt call them looked at the letter wondering how much it would add up to taxes interest some penalty guessed four thousand dollars maybe fortyfive hundred dollars opened the letter the letter said we have been unable to resolve your account see attachment and our attempts to reach you by telephone have not been successful to eliminate the need for personal visit to your residence or place of business send payment in full and all delinquent tax due in the enclosed envelope within seven days from the date of this letter it was signed chief research group the attachment said we have previously written you asking for payment of the federal tax identified below but we have no record of receiving it the tax is overdue and the law authorizes us to seize your property wages or other assets to satisfy your unpaid tax the total amount due includes interest and penalty and should be paid immediately to avoid additional charges 5839877 it had to be mistake called the irs office on golden gate avenue here in san francisco it took me week to get them on the phone it was the week between christmas and new years and the lines were always busy when got through got the runaround finally got william lincoln revenue officer on the phone arranged time to see him ended the conversation by saying thanks bill he said you may call me officer lincoln revenue officer lincoln was corpulent he had pants that would nt fit over belly gone to pot and shining gold tooth that flashed when he talked he leaned back in his chair and squinted at me over large pock marked nose that had never recovered from being seventeen years old was scared and said know owe back taxes there is no question that owe back taxes but there is think question of how much back taxes owe agent lincoln said mister hansen you apparently owe substantial amount of money and have made no effort to pay it am only authorized to collect money if you feel there is some error in the computation of the taxes due you may pay the amount in full and then file request that the account be examined if some mistake has been made the extra tax that you pay will be refunded of course no interest will be paid on the excess amount it was like he did nt hear me look you did nt listen to what said owe about two thousand for that year here is copy of my tax return showing owed about two thousand look at the bottom line taxes due eighteen hundred and ninetyfive dollars he said mister hansen the irs will be happy to reopen your case once you have paid the fiftyeight thousand dollars if after paying you are dissatisfied you may file an appeal to have the file reopened if we made mistake your excess payment will be refunded was starting to get angry as well as scared have two problems here first it not clear owe the irs fifty thousand dollars second would be amazed if ever have fifty thousand dollars he still was nt listening mister hansen do you own car well yes have chevy that about yearandahalf old well we can take your car and sell it and apply the proceeds to the outstanding balance on your tax account wait minute we still have nt figured out how much owe you guys and now you are going to take my car away do nt see how that makes any sense still owe more on the car than it is worth that not our problem mister hansen you should discuss that with the bank how much do you pay in rent told him seven hundred fifty per month why we can take back your rent from your landlord each month and apply that money toward your tax bill wait minute pay my rent you go to my landlord and tell him it really your money and take it what does the landlord do officer lincoln flashed his gold tooth in his first smile of the day your landlord will probably throw you out so now that do nt have job because ca nt get to it without car and ca nt take showers anymore because do nt have place to live because you got me thrown out how am supposed to pay the fifty thousand dollars mister hansen you owe us great deal of money how you propose to pay it is not really my problem it is my responsibility to take any steps necessary to collect these taxes am authorized to take your car and your rent can even take your entire paycheck every week now that you get all my paycheck my car and my home might as well move to another country he did nt even blink mister hansen we have collection offices in every major city in any country you are likely to move to we are happy to continue this matter in the country of your choice this was all could handle for one day told him needed day or two to think about all this and would call him back left the federal building and wandered into the fog since they put in the underground muni has been running antique streetcars on market street in the summer and during the holidays was in no hurry had time even if did nt have money hopped on an old streetcar that must have been salvaged from the spanishamerican war had my head leaning on the glass watching things spin by and spotted the libertarian bookstore got off at the next stop and walked back to the store the place was full of pamphlets posters books and magazines asked the clerk do you have anything about the irs he said there was whole section and asked me what my problem was told him he told me you know there is group of people meeting tomorrow night maybe you should go he wrote down the address on the back of bookmark for me did nt think much about it and stuffed it in my pocket went through the irs section and bought few books and pamphlets walked the rest of the way home my apartment is just above castro street almost in noe valley made myself sandwich and opened beer after the news on tv started reading the books and pamphlets one book interviewed an irs agent they asked if there would ever be tax revolt he said no because people who do nt want to pay taxes do nt have to people who make enough money or people who work in the underground economy and people or organizations with special interests do nt pay taxes the books did nt cheer me up consoled myself by thinking revenue officer lincoln was having bad day no one can stay angry for ever tomorrow would be better chapter two got up late hung over called the appointment clerk at the irs office and made two oclock appointment to see revenue officer william dontcallmebill lincoln at two butterflies were running track meet in my stomach did some quick breathing then went up to see the man hoped he had good night sleep maybe his football team won he was ugly and unpleasant but who knows maybe he got laid last night said good morning he said mister hansen in our meetings you have been unhelpful do nt feel that you are cooperating with me waitaminute said told you owed you some money even filed return almost on time would love to pay you the money owe would just like to know how much really owe and do nt see how it can possibly be fifty thousand dollars would love to pay what owe the sooner the better you have been very effective am very scared but do nt have fifty thousand dollars even if did owe you that much which do nt mister hansen when you have been revenue agent for while you start to get sixth sense for people who are holding out on you sixth sense about people who are trying to cheat on their taxes or hide something know you are one of those people can feel it can tell you are hiding something from me concealing money opened my mouth to say something just as lincoln said you leave me no choice in this matter am registering our tax lien with the county recorder this will show up on your credit report immediately you wo nt be able to borrow any money from now on am also going to attach your wages all your wages we will come and get your car then we will take your rent money back from your landlord it sounded convincing did nt see how things could get worse until he said am convinced you are concealing assets from us and have probably cheated on your taxes am going to request full audit of all your tax returns for the last five years if the auditors find anything wrong you could go to jail got mad look this is bullshit owe you maybe four grand with penalties and interest you are trying to make me sound like al capone you wo nt tell me what really owe had read in one of the pamphlets that was entitled to see speak to supervisor if was having problem with revenue agent want to talk to your supervisor no hesitated am entitled to talk to your supervisor please get him he left the room for minute he came back in smiling and said have discussed this matter with my supervisor he does nt want to talk to one of my taxpayers at least the buck spent on the pamphlet was taxdeductible because it was nt helping me much well come and get me asshole because there is no way am ever going to find fifty thousand dollars he told me call me when you know how you will pay us the money you owe and handed me his business card took it and stumbled out of the office outside put the card in my jacket pocket when reached in felt something else there pulled it out and saw the bookmark from the libertarian bookstore it had the address and time of the meeting the meeting was for later the same day left the federal building and headed for the nearest bar found cute place on the edge of the tenderloin the tenderloin is famous for tenbuck hookers drunks and great vietnamese food we call it the wine country the neighborhood was as depressed as was this is probably where would wind up after they took my apartment nice gutter in the middle of the wine country after few beers looked at my watch and saw fivethirty fished out the bookmark and there was the address in the western addition and the time six oclock if did nt hurry too much would get there just at six took the bus then the shoe leather express to flat across from the projects deep in the western addition would nt have had the courage to walk around here without the beers this was nt good place for skinny programmer to be without track shoes or gun rang the bell and got buzzed in through the security gate upstairs at the door said hi joe sent me the guy at the door looked me up then down then let me in without saying anything the meetings was in the living room of flat that had seen better days the flat was carved out of what had once been fancy victorian house an old building that had seen its share of faded dreams looked for seat saw one in the back and sat down behind this really great looking lady no one would see me next to anyone that good looking would get lost in the rug or the wallpaper someone named jim samuelson stood up introduced himself and said this was meeting of citizens for just taxation the united states began in revolt against unfair taxation where have we come to on average thirtyfour percent of what everyone makes goes to federal taxes except for the rich who do nt pay much he pointed out the fifteen per cent of the gross national product went directly for taxes another fifteen percent went to pay for tax collection this included paying irs agents accountants cpa attorneys and the like over million people do nt pay any taxes at all they are were tax dodgers or conscientious objectors or did nt want to pay for guns and bombs samuelson ended the meeting by soliciting donations and pointing to pamphlets at the back that were for sale felt already had corner on the pamphlet market did nt donate was saving my money for the irs was getting ready to fade back out to the street when much to my surprise the hotticket blonde the one hid behind who looked even better standing up and facing my direction said hello this was surprise as good looking girls had developed blind spot for me in junior high she introduced herself told me her name was susan and asked if she could buy me drink we took her car to fern bar near the opera house it was quiet the incrowd had been avoiding it for the last few months since the big coke bust ordered beer she asked for white wine susan asked me where was from what did and how felt about all this trouble with the irs the beers made me more glib than usual and told her everything got tired and we called it quits she offered to drive me home said sure and we left as we pulled up in front of my flat she asked me for my phone number she added maybe we could get together for another drink some time gave her my number but no one that attractive would ever call me again but would rather fantasize about her than officer lincoln chapter three susan called and invited me to dinner no accounting for taste never expected call said yes maybe my luck was improving susan lived downtown at the base of nob hill on bush told her seven and asked what to bring said could bring anything that did nt have to be caught cleaned or cooked she said to bring wine even though the irs was after me still had to work for living worked at printing company we had just bought the newest fanciest laser printer to replace our older laser printer my job was training it to be useful we did highvolume custom printing we took computer tapes and printed from them we did the telephone books for the telephone company for example telephone books for large multinationals headquartered in san francisco catalogs big books that would change frequently my work never got me laid but liked it after computers was interested in monday night football and beer maybe susan liked football on the way over stopped at big liquor store do nt know much about wine so bought something that was red and cost twelve dollars rang the bell she buzzed me in and trudged up three flights of stairs she was dressed in shift kind of thing she had misplaced her bra somewhere she looked even better than remembered susan was fivefive maybe one hundred and fifteen pounds and blond would wait until after dinner if she could cook would propose over dessert well could she cook pasta salad and killer triple chocolate layer cake from just desserts the wine disappeared even though it turned out to be the wrong color susan said how much she liked it assumed she was being nice our conversation turned to the irs her father had been in big trouble that was why she was at the meeting he got letter like mine his letter said he owed fourteen hundred dollars he did nt think he owed it he had paid all his taxes he had filed on time so he wrote letter asking for meeting the irs never wrote back just kept sending dunning letters he was afraid they would come after his bank account so he wrote to the bank and told them not to give the irs any money without court order the bank said sorry if the irs came after his checking account they were going to give it to them they had to it was the law next month the bank turned fifteen hundred dollars over to the irs pop was farmer stubborn he thought nobody was guilty until proven guilty he figured no one should take his money without court order acting as his own attorney he filed suit against his bank pop owed half of farmequipment loan for new tractor because the bank took the money out of his account without his permission he wrote saying he would nt be paying the note anymore in the first week of july the court issued an order for the bank allowing the tractor to be taken susan showed me news clipping from the little forks herald it said yesterday morning on the fourth of july deputy samuel dick and deputy jim frost of the little forks sheriff department went to donald cherry farm twenty miles south of town they took truck with them planning to take his tractor they said he had nt paid his loan sheriff johnson said the deputies arrived at the scene at 1130 am the deputies claim they met someone at the sight who said cherry did nt want the equipment moved they were told cherry had gun and knew how to use it the deputies hitched the tractor to the truck and started back to little forks one sheriff car was ahead of the truck another was behind it miller said cherry car approached the convoy from behind cherry passed the rear car and the truck cherry cut in front of the truck forcing it to pull over the deputy in the front car pulled across the road blocking it cherry had his wife jane and daughter susan in the car he jumped out and exchanged words with the deputies the deputy in the front car told cherry over the loudspeaker to get back in his car and leave quietly cherry refused the deputy than said he was under arrest that he should raise his hands and stand quietly cherry refused the order and got back in the car he drove toward the deputy car which was still blocking the road the deputy claimed to see something that looked like pistol in cherry hand no pistol was found in the car the deputy ordered cherry to halt but he kept driving the deputy fired two rounds from his twelvegauge shotgun into the cherry car mr cherry was taken to the hospital where he died shortly after arrival mrs cherry was treated for minor wounds and released the daughter was unharmed cherry had no criminal record susan told me how terrible it was her father would have never fired at sheriff deputy even if he had gun which he did nt he had not been expecting any violence that why he took his wife and daughter susan said her father believed in his country he could nt believe the irs could take his money without court trial he thought he was free man living in free country it was nt over susan and her mother were charged with attempted murder if they had nt charged susan and her mom for felony the deputies could nt justify the shooting susan left rather than face the charges she was still on the run did nt know that nobody creditor the federal government another citizen foreign power has the right to seize property without due process of law except the irs the president would have to declare martial law to get away with something like this did nt know what to say that must have been incredible horrible she started to cryi put my arm around shoulder to comfort her she cried and cried after the crying we talked and talked until the small hours of the morning finally looked at the time and said should go home it late susan said do nt go please it so nice having you here the next thing knew we were kissing said gee maybe we should stop for while susan started unbuttoning my shirt the next thing knew we were headed to the bedroom susan sat me down on the edge of the bed and said do nt go away was nt going anywhere she disappeared when she came back she had on even less than before she lit some candles she said they made her feel sexy did nt think she needed help she took off all my clothes slowly she pulled back the covers on the bed and pushed me on my back tried to grab her but she pushed me back on the bed and asked do you like being tied up did nt know had never tried it before was too excited to say no she reached into the nightstand and pulled out some ribbons she tied the ribbons around my wrists and my wrists to the headboard then she tied my ankles to the footboard she said you ve been verrrry naughty susan is going to have to punish you she took out huge feather and started stroking it up and down my body was going bullshit was dying to grab her and could nt could nt believe how much fun this kinky stuff was next she brought out an ice cube and started working me over with it this left me gasping for air she was telling me what to do the whole time loved it then she started kissing me all over my lips neck down my chest then blowjob do nt know why the call it blow job she was nt doing much blowing she grabbed my balls in one hand she started squeezing just as came she broke vial of something under my nose found out later it was popper amyl nitrate it was intense it felt like nasa moonshot had never been tied up before but could nt wait to try it again it even made me forget about the irs for while chapter four susan was up early she said she had things to do did nt know where she worked did nt know if fugitives worked for living showered and dressed went out for coffee then went home would nt have believed susan story about her dad few weeks back after my own visits with revenue agent lincoln anything seemed possible from that night susan and spent all our free time together we had much in common liked being tied up she liked tying me up we both disliked the irs susan was working for political organization this explained the odd hours she worked she said they knew she was in trouble with the irs and the law had nt seen my accountant yet was hoping the irs would go away if ignored them long enough it was only january seventeenth did nt think anything would happen fast had been spending nights at susan that morning was supposed to drive to sunnyvale to see client the client had custom printing needs and would have to do some programming for them had to see them to estimate job was running late to work went downstairsand opened the front door did nt see my car

though did nt have the cash hoofed it down to the city towing lot it was depressing there was long line of people trying to get their cars out of hock it took me 45 minutes of standing in line to get up to the bullet proof window and see the copinabox he said they did nt have my car and asked why did nt just call first he told me they did nt have any record of my car and that the street had parked on was nt towaway zone anyway he asked me if would like to file stolen vehicle report told him no that think knew who had it would have to let my boss know so they could get someone else to attend the meeting in sunnyvale took the bus to the office when got there lois the receptionist said the boss had been looking for me and wanted me to meet him in accounting immediately on the way to accounting

irs and said that everything owned had been confiscated by the united states government took it off the door folded it up and put it in my pocket the door was unlocked went inside everything was gone the place had been picked clean they had even taken the beer out of the refrigerator found note taped to the refrigerator from my landlord asking me to see him as soon as possible something about having to give my rent money to the irs dumped few papers that were left into my box and left it in the bedroom there were few clothes they did nt take still in the closet left on the way out saw that there were letters in my mailbox opened the box and got them out they looked like bounce notices from the bank they were bounce notices from the bank use my personal computer to balance my checkbook have never bounced check when opened the envelopes saw all my checks were bouncing could guess who had the money that used to be in my checking account no car no job no apartment no money all in one morning did have dollar so took the bus to susan she was home when got there she took me inside put me on the couch and gave me beer told her about my morning she said those bastards someone should

spot but maybe could still get it fixed told her would like to do whatever you think is best she said this will work out just fine your going to get an opportunity to fight back chapter five was angry but it came with wierd sense of freedom life had never held surprises like these went to college because my folks thought should studied computer science because my advisor thought it was good idea got job did what you re supposed to do worked paid most of my taxes had quiet predictable life nobody landlord mediocre job broken stereo car that did nt own told susan that was ready for anything susan went to talk to her friends about me she came back happy she said talked with everyone they already knew we are dating everyone wants to meet you tonight after dinner we went to house in the haightashbury that neighborhood has changed even though some of the people are still trapped in timewarp the old head shops have been remodeled to sell coffee beans and imported cheese to yuppies the group was nondescript until they talked they all had an axe to grind we were talking serious tax protestors here there were six people four men and two women beside susan and me one of the men steve started talking to me this group is dedicated to the elimination of the irs we believe that politicians have ignored the constitution and sold out american workers and the middle class taxes have transformed american workers from free men to slaves you think slaves wear legirons and are confined and beaten free man owns what he produces and slave does nt in the middle ages serfs gave over to their lord twentyfive percent of everything they produced in return they received protection how does serf gving up twentyfive percent differ from the american worker who gives up thirtyfive percent increasing taxation driven by government greed and incompetence has made slaves out of america working people by 1972 government expenditures equaled eightythreepointfive percent of the total gross product of all us manufacturing all us agriculture all us mining all petroleum and natural gas production all us communications and all electrical gas and sanitation services combined by 1979 the irs had over eighty seven thousand employees and spent well over two billion dollars to collect the equivalent of two thousand and eightythree dollars from every person in america over sixty percent over one and quarter billion dollars of the revenues the irs collect are budgeted to enforcing collection collection procedures auditing investigating and prosecuting this is the harassment and intimidation of american taxpayers even more money is wasted on lawyers accountants and record keeping needed to feed the irs bureaucracy in order to allow the irs to enforce the collection of usurious taxes politicians have sold our constitutional rights down the river the irs extorts people into waiving their constitutional rights by demanding signed return they force you into perjury the irs has irs courts where most of the judges are exirs employees the irs maintains their own hit list the irs has over three thousand armed agents they enlist the aid of the fbi and local police forces as they see fit the irs collects massive amounts of information on private citizens any other agency would be prohibited from having this information the irs is willing to drive businesses into bankruptcy to collect taxes the irs can take all your property without due process of law irs procedures are designed to intimidate harass and suppress the individual the irs goes to extraordinary lengths to prevent the taxpayer from seeking relief or redress outside the agency they make it almost impossible for taxpayer to be judged in court of law by his peers the irs goes to great lengths to hide their abuses from the public it protects itself by ruining the careers of elected officials who oppose them destroying files that would prove irs misconduct and scaring the average taxpayer in enforcing the sixteenth amendment the irs has thrown away the first fourth fifth sixth seventh eight ninth and tenth amendments to the constitution the irs encourages confrontations with tax protestors the irs does not dislike tax protestors it needs protestors to create fear in the mind of the average taxpayer the the irs encourages confrontations with the patriotic americans who struggle against irs tyranny politicians have unleashed bureaucracy of terror called irs this irs has grown so powerful that even the politicians who created the monster are scared of it no politician dares investigate it when politician is either brave enough or foolish enough to oppose the irs the irs will harass that politician up to and including the rigging of elections our organization is dedicated to the destruction of the irs we like the american patriots who founded country in rebellion against oppression and tyranny and excessive taxation are fighting this modern tyranny and oppression like our ancestors before us we are dedicated to the struggle for human rights and dignity granted to every american by the constitution we will defend this constitution with our own blood if need be where the politicians are too weak to make stand chapter six other political groups provided our support and funds foundations gave money like the americans for americans foundation liberals who had supported the antiwar groups of the late sixties kicked in money surprising amounts of money we were even nonprofit taxfree organization the events team was always busy the regular media would nt give us the time of day they were afraid of the irs too we were nt republican or democrat or large so we did nt get media coverage we worked with groups that focused on environmental or nuclear issues when they held rallies or events we supported them later they would support us we were well organized there was even personal computer fell into working with the computer automated the mailing list for the newsletter and put fundraising information into data base stopped hearing from the irs they did nt have forwarding address and was nt going to give them one owed them money so they claimed but had nt done anything yet that was illegal when was nt working or with susan was at rallies remember my first one we were protesting foreclosures of farms in the midwest we had been working to gain support for noontime rally downtown there was terrific amount of work in organizing permits and speakers and sound equipment and all the million things needed for political rally more rallies were held over the months more newsletters sent out the daytoday grind of political activism when signed up had thought every day would be an adventure but no things moved slowly and no adventure reared its head we made big push at tax time to send out extra editions of the newsletter we tried to capture the interest of the popular press and television the press and television would nt cover us the best we could get was few paragraphs in the bay guardian we could nt even get into the san francisco chronicle even though just about anything else could it was frustrating anyone talked to would listen to my irs horror stories then give me polite brushoff you re kidding they ca nt do that if had nt experienced trouble with the irs would nt have believed susan story nobody was interested in the irs everybody was busy trying to file before the deadline on the fifteenth the world got through tax time just as it always did except that did nt file was finally breaking the law people just kept on paying thankful that the system left them as much as it did withholding taxes makes it easier for people to ignore taxes people get used to withholding they think in terms of what left in each paycheck there was factory in the south years back that started taking all of month withholding out of one paycheck this made it clear just how big the bite was this did nt last long and the irs made it mandatory that withholding be taken out of wages as they were earned nice psychological buffer withholding just think how people would react if at christmas time the irs said by the way you owe us fifteen thousand dollars the average taxpayer was complacent did nt see what we could do to blast away that average complacency mr and ms middle america were still dancing down the yellow brick road to april fifteenth there are many tax protestors perhaps millions some people do nt file taxes and stay in the underground economy some brave foolhardy souls file fifth amendment returns these have names and statement against paying taxes just an unsigned form 1040 with note that says signing it would violate fifth amendment rights about selfincrimination these folks were too loosely organized to be effective some of what we were doing like not filing our income tax returns was illegal but we were nt into any of the big stuff nobody was shooting at us and did nt feel we were changing the irs chapter seven several months went quietly by was happy nice job nice girl nice computer spent more time outdoors with rallies can remember when it ended it was my fault we were back from rally at the university of california medical laboratories we were there in support of animal rights the school board of directors was meeting and we arranged demonstration for them show of force by people who did nt have any force and would nt have used it if they did it was successful ten of the animal rights activists were arrested for being disorderly in public and had their pictures taken by the tac squad had been to so many demonstrations that was on firstname basis with the tac squad proanimal support was far afield but we owed favors someone had called in political debt there were print reporters and one television crew it looked like we might get press on this we got back late everybody was tired we decided to have supper together eating always cheered us up we had homemade pizza vegetarian in honor of the day activities we had beer too my favorite afterdemonstration beverage was digesting the pizza and reading computer magazine there was interesting new stuff it always amazed mo to see equipment get smaller faster and cheaper gear that would have cost millions five years back only cost thousands now the new stuff does things the old gear would never do it was tuesday night and no interesting sports were on the tube everyone was lounging around waiting for the peppers on the pizza to wear off spontaneous meeting sent steve into one of his eloquent tirades against the irs everyone went on and on listened then dozed off into day dreams was thinking about what would do to the irs if had the bucks had an idea patently simple batted it around inside my head for while held it up to the light looked underneath it the more thought about it the more it seemed like good idea got out note paper and while everyone else was talking started writing the more thought about my plan the better it looked starting outlining what would be needed people machinery supplies then put times on everything and figured what equipment and supplies would cost it seemed like wonderful idea until added up the numbers nine to ten months and bunch of money already knew that the irs had all the money we kept getting enough to eke by but this involved serious bucks grew depressed again my idea seemed like an adolescent fantasy started thinking what an edge in material and resources the irs had over us only couple of us were still sitting around talking finally someone said we need stop the irs we need to stop the bastards responded you know it just shame we ca nt do anything effective the guy snarled oh yeah so what makes you so smart asshole what would mr programmer do said look busting the irs would be duck soup could stop them dead in their tracks the trouble is it would be expensive steve said what expensive looked down at my scribbles and said about two hundred thousand dollars steve got up walked over to me looked me straight in the eye and said can probably get two hundred thousand dollars this is when my life stopped being easy was about to make my first runin with the irs look like friendship day at gay bathhouse told everyone my plan they tried to poke holes in it but the more they listened the more they liked it like all good plans and even if say so myself it was good this plan was simple it was easy to the point of foolproof you just had to have the right idea the right people the right funding and the right equipment all at the right time all of which we could get except the money maybe had to spend lot of time explaining the equipment would use how it would work where you could get it my idea was technology trip this required serious explaining to the troops most of these people could nt tell computer from toaster susan for example had trouble getting mr coffee to come on at the right time in the morning it looked as if we could fuck the irs if we could get the money steve said he would check about the money first thing in the morning thought two hundred thousand dollars or more was big money did nt see anyone giving it to group like us if we were the republican party two hundred thousand dollars would nt be big deal but who would give it to us we went home for the night when we got back home she was excited and bit drunk she loved my plan we had more to drink and headed for the bedroom one thing lead to another and before could say blow up the irs was tied to the bed frame susan said you have been verrry verrry bad and have something special for you she was talking with long again so knew was in for big treat wo nt tell you everything she did far too shy but just let me say it was great
