microscope now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in triumph it is glue watson said he unquestionably it is glue have look at these scattered objects in the field stooped to the eyepiece and focussed for my vision those hairs are threads from tweed coat the irregular gray masses are dust there are epithelial scales on the left those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue well said laughing am prepared to take your word for it does anything depend upon it it is very fine demonstration he answered in the st pancras case you may remember that cap was found beside the dead policeman the accused man denies that it is his but he is pictureframe maker who habitually handles glue is it one of your cases no my friend merivale of the yard asked me to look into the case since ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope he looked impatiently at his watch had new client calling but he is overdue by the way watson you know something of racing ought to pay for it with about half my wound pension then ll make you my handy guide to the turf what about sir robert norberton does the name recall anything well should say so he lives at shoscombe old place and know it well for my summer quarters were down there once norberton nearly came within your province once how was that it was when he horsewhipped sam brewer the wellknown curzon street moneylender on newmarket heath he nearly killed the man ah he sounds interesting does he often indulge in that way well he has the name of being dangerous man he is about the most daredevil rider in england second in the grand national few years back he is one of those men who have overshot their true generation he should have been buck in the days of the regency boxer an athlete plunger on the turf lover of fair ladies and by all account so far down queer street that he may never find his way back again capital watson thumbnail sketch seem to know the man now can you give me some idea of shoscombe old place only that it is in the centre of shoscombe park and that the famous shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there and the head trainer said holmes is john mason you need not look surprised at my knowledge watson for this is letter from him which am unfolding but let us have some more about shoscombe seem to have struck rich vein there are the shoscombe spaniels said you hear of them at every dog show the most exclusive breed in england they are the special pride of the lady of shoscombe old place sir robert norberton wife presume sir robert has never married just as well think consider ing his prospects he lives with his widowed sister lady beatrice falder you mean that she lives with him no no the place belonged to her late husband sir james norberton has no claim on it at all it is only life interest and reverts to her husband brother meantime she draws the rents every year and brother robert suppose spends the said rents that is about the size of it he is devil of fellow and must lead her most uneasy life yet have heard that she is devoted to him but what is amiss at shoscombe ah that is just what want to know and here expect is the man who can tell us the door had opened and the page had shown in tall cleanshaven man with the firm austere expression which is only seen upon those who have to control horses or boys mr john mason had many of both under his sway and he looked equal to the task he bowed with cold selfpossession and seated himself upon the chair to which holmes had waved him you had my note mr holmes yes but it explained nothing it was too delicate thing for me to put the details on paper and too complicated it was only face to face could do it well we are at your disposal first of all mr holmes think that my employer sir robert has gone mad holmes raised his eyebrows this is baker street not harley street said he but why do you say so well sir when man does one queer thing or two queer things there may be meaning to it but when everything he does is queer then you begin to wonder believe shoscombe prince and the derby have turned his brain that is colt you are running the best in england mr holmes should know if anyone does now ll be plain with you for know you are gentlemen of honour and that it wo nt go beyond the room sir robert has got to win this derby he up to the neck and it his last chance everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse and at fine odds too you can get forties now but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him but how is that if the horse is so good the public do nt know how good he is sir robert has been too clever for the touts he has the prince halfbrother out for spins you ca nt tell em apart but there are two lengths in furlong between them when it comes to gallop he thinks of nothing but the horse and the race his whole life is on it hes holding off the jews till then if the prince fails him he is done it seems rather desperate gamble but where does the madness come in well first of all you have only to look at him dont believe he sleeps at night he is down at the stables at all hours his eyes are wild it has all been too much for his nerves then there is his conduct to lady beatrice ah what is that they have always been the best of friends they had the same tastes the two of them and she loved the horses as much as he did every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them and above all she loved the prince he would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar but that all over now why well she seems to have lost all interest in the horses for week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as goodmorning you think there has been quarrel and bitter savage spitelful quarrel at that why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child he gave it few days ago to old barnes what keeps the green dragon three miles off at crendall that certainly did seem strange of course with her weak heart and dropsy one couldnt expect that she could get about with him but he spent two hours every evening in her room he might well do what he could for she has been rare good friend to him but that all over too he never goes near her and she takes it to heart she is brooding and sulky and drinking mr holmes drinking like fish did she drink before this estrangement well she took her glass but now it is often whole bottle of an evening so stephens the butler told me it all changed mr holmes and there is something damned rotten about it but then again what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night and who is the man that meets him there holmes rubbed his hands go on mr mason you get more and more interesting it was the butler who saw him go twelve oclock at night and raining hard so next night was up at the house and sure enough master was off again stephens and went after him but it was jumpy work for it would have been bad job if he had seen us he terrible man with his fists if he gets started and no respecter of persons so we were shy of getting too near but we marked him down all light it was the haunted crypt that he was making for and there was man waiting for him there what is this haunted cryp well sir there is an old ruined chapel in the park it is so old that nobody could fix its date and under it there crypt which has bad name among us it dark damp lonely place by day but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night but master not afraid he never feared anything in his life but what is he doing there in the nighttime wait bit said holmes you say there is another man there it must be one of your own stablemen or someone from the house surely you have only to spot who it is and question him it no one know how can you say that because have seen him mr holmes it was on that second night sir robert turned and passed us me and stephens quak ing in the bushes like two bunnyrabbits for there was bit of moon that night but we could hear the other moving about behind we were not afraid of him so we up when sir robert was gone and pretended we were just having walk like in the moonlight and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please hullo mate who may you be says guess he had not heard us coming so he looked over his shoulder with face as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell he let out yell and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness he could run ll give him that in minute he was out of sight and hearing and who he was or what he was we never found but you saw him clearly in the moonlight yes would swear to his yellow face mean dog should say what could he have in common with sir robert holmes sat for some time lost in thought who keeps lady beatrice falder company he asked at last there is her maid carrie evans she has been with her this five years and is no doubt devoted mr mason shuffled uncomfortably she devoted enough he answered at last but wont say to whom ah said holmes ca nt tell tales out of school quite understand mr mason of course the situation is clear enough from dr watson description of sir robert can realize that no woman is safe from him do nt you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there well the scandal has been pretty clear for long time but she may not have seen it before let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out she wants to get rid of the woman her brother will not permit it the invalid with her weak heart and inability to get about has no means of enforcing her will the hated maid is still tied to her the lady refuses to speak sulks takes to drink sir robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her does not all this hang together well it might do so far as it goes exactly as far as it goes how would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt we ca nt fit that into our plot no sir and there is something more that ca nt fit in why should sir robert want to dig up dead body holmes sat up abruptly we only found it out yesterday after had written to you yesterday sir robert had gone to london so stephens and went down to the crypt it was all in order sir except that in one corner was bit of human body you informed the police suppose our visitor smiled grimly well sir think it would hardly interest them it was just the head and few bones of mummy it may have been thousand years old but it was nt there before that ll swear and so will stephens it had been stowed away in corner and covered over with board but that corner had always been empty before what did you do with it well we just left it there that was wise you say sir robert was away yesterday has he returned we expect him back today when did sir robert give away his sister dog it was just week ago today the creature was howling outside the old wellhouse and sir robert was in one of his tantrums that morning he caught it up and thought he would have killed it then he gave it to sandy bain the jockey and told him to take the dog to old barnes at the green dragon for he never wished to see it again holmes sat for some time in silent thought he had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter mr mason he said at last ca nt you make it more definite perhaps this will make it more definite mr holmes said our visltor he took paper from his pocket and unwrapping it care fully he exposed charred fragment of bone holmes examined it with interest where did you get it there is central heating furnace in the cellar under lady beatrice room it been off for some time but sir robert complained of cold and had it on again harvey runs it he one of my lads this very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders he did nt like the look of it nor do said holmes what do you make of it watson it was burned to black cinder but there could be no question as to its anatomical significance it the upper condyle of human femur said exactly holmes had become very serious when does this lad tend to the furnace he makes it up every evening and then leaves it then anyone could visit it during the night yes sir can you enter it from outside there is one door from outside there is another which leads up by stair to the passage in which lady beatrice room is situated these are deep waters mr mason deep and rather dirty you say that sir robert was not at home last night no sir then whoever was burning bones it was not he that true sir what is the name of that inn you spoke of the green dragon is there good fishing in that part of berkshire the honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life well sir ve heard there are trout in the millstream and pike in the hall lake that good enough watson and are famous fishermen are we not watson you may address us in future at the green dragon we should reach it tonight need not say that we do nt want to see you mr mason but note will reach us and no doubt could find you if want you when we have gone little farther into the matter will let you have considered opinion thus it was that on bright may evening holmes and found ourselves alone in firstclass carriage and bound for the little haltondemand station of shoscombe the rack above us was covered with formidable litter of rods reels and baskets on reaching our destination short drive took us to an oldfashioned tavern where sporting host josiah barnes entered eagerly into our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood what about the hall lake and the chance of pike said holmes the face of the innkeeper clouded that would nt do sir you might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through how that then it sir robert sir he terrible jealous of touts if you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that he be after you as sure as fate he ai nt taking no chances sir robert ai nt ve heard he has horse entered for the derby yes and good colt too he carries all our money for the race and all sir robert into the bargain by the way he looked at us with thoughtful eyes suppose you ai nt on the turf yourselves no indeed just two weary londoners who badly need some good berkshire air well you are in the right place for that there is deal of it lying about but mind what have told you about sir robert he the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards keep clear of the park surely mr barnes we certainly shall by the way that was most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall should say it was that was the real shoscombe breed there ai nt better in england am dogfancier myself said holmes now if it is fair question what would prize dog like that cost more than could pay sir it was sir robert himself who gave me this one that why have to keep it on lead it would be off to the hall in jiffy if gave it its head we are getting some cards in our hand watson said holmes when the landlord had left us it not an easy one to play but we may see our way in day or two by the way sir robert is still in london hear we might perhaps enter the sacred domain tonight without fear of bodily assault there are one or two points on which should like reassurance have you any theory holmes only this watson that something happened week or so ago which has cut deep into the life of the shoscombe house hold what is that something we can only guess at it from its effects they seem to be of curiously mixed character but that should surely help us it is only the colourless uneventful case which is hopeless let us consider our data the brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister he gives away her favourite dog her dog watson does that suggest nothing to you nothing but the brother spite well it might be so or well there is an alternative now to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel if there is quarrel began the lady keeps her room alters her habits is not seen save when she drives out with her maid refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse and apparently takes to drink that covers the case does it not save for the business in the crypt that is another line of thought there are two and beg you will not tangle them line which concerns lady beatrice has vaguely sinister flavour has it not can make nothing of it well now let us take up line which concerns sir robert he is mad keen upon winning the derby he is in the hands of the jews and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors he is daring and desperate man he derives his income from his sister his sister maid is his willing tool so far we seem to be on fairly safe ground do we not but the crypt ah yes the crypt let us suppose watson it is merely scandalous supposition hypothesis put forward for arguments sake that sir robert has done away with his sister my dear holmes it is out of the question very possibly watson sir robert is man of an honourable stock but you do occasionally find carrion crow among the eagles let us for moment argue upon this supposition he could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with shoscombe prince therefore he has still to stand his ground to do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim and he would also have to find substitute who would imperson ate her with the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible the woman body might be conveyed to the crypt which is place so seldom visited and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen what say you to that watson wel it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition think that there is small experiment which we may try tomorrow watson in order to throw some light on the matter meanwhile if we mean to keep up our characters suggest that we have our host in for glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace which seems to be the straight road to his affections we may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process in the morning holmes discovered that we had come without our spoonbait for jack which absolved us from fishing for the day about eleven oclock we started for walk and he obtained leave to take the black spaniel with us this is the place said he as we came to two high park gates with heraldic griffins towering above them about mid day mr barnes informs me the old lady takes drive and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened when it comes through and before it gathers speed want you watson to stop the coachman with some question never mind me shall stand behind this hollybush and see what can see it was not long vigil within quarter of an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue with two splendid highstepping gray carriage horses in the shafts holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog stood uncon cemedly swinging cane in the roadway keeper ran out and the gates swung open the carriage had slowed to walk and was able to get good look at the occupants highly coloured young woman with flaxen hair and impudent eyes sat on the left at her right was an elderly person with rounded back and huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which proclaimed the invalid when the horses reached the highroad held up my hand with an authoritative gesture and as the coachman pulled up inquired if sir robert was at shoscombe old place at the same moment holmes stepped out and released the spaniel with joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step then in moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage and it snapped at the black skirt above it drive on drive on shrieked harsh voice the coachman lashed the horses and we were left standing in the roadway well watson that done it said holmes as he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited spaniel he thought it was his mistress and he found it was stranger dogs do nt make mistakes but it was the voice of man cried exactly we have added one card to our hand watson but it needs careful playing all the same my companion seemed to have no further plans for the day and we did actually use our fishing tackle in the millstream with the result that we had dish of trout for our supper it was only after that meal that holmes showed signs of renewed activ ity once more we found ourselves upon the same road as in the morning which led us to the park gates tall dark figure was awaiting us there who proved to be our london acquaintance mr john mason the trainer goodevening gentlemen said he got your note mr holmes sir robert has not returned yet but hear that he is expected tonight how far is this crypt from the house asked holmes good quarter of mile then think we can disregard him altogether ca nt afford to do that mr holmes the moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of shoscombe prince see in that case we must work without you mr mason you can show us the crypt and then leave us it was pitchdark and without moon but mason led us over the grasslands until dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to be the ancient chapel we entered the broken gap which was once the porch and our guide stumbling among heaps of loose masonry picked his way to the corner of the building where steep stair led down into the crypt striking match he illuminated the melancholy place dismal and evilsmelling with ancient crumbling walls of roughhewn stone and piles of cof fins some of lead and some of stone extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads holmes had lit his lantern which shot tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene its rays were reflected back from the coffinplates many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to the gate of death you spoke of some bones mr mason could you show them before you go they are here in this corner the trainer strode across and then stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place they are gone said he so expected said holmes chuckling fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed part but why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of man who has been dead thousand years asked john mason that is what we are here to find out said holmes it may mean long search and we need not detain you fancy that we shall get our solution before morning when john mason had left us holmes set to work making very careful examination of the graves ranging from very ancient one which appeared to be saxon in the centre through long line of norman hugos and odos until we reached the sir william and sir denis falder of the eighteenth century it was an hour or more before holmes came to leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault heard his little cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried but purposeful move ments that he had reached goal with his lens he was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid then he drew from his pocket short jemmy boxopener which he thrust into chink levering back the whole front which seemed to be se cured by only couple of clamps there was rending tearing sound as it gave way but it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen interruption someone was walking in the chapel above it was the firm rapid step of one who came with definite purpose and knew well the ground upon which he walked light streamed down the stairs and an instant later the man who bore it was framed in the gothic archway he was terrible figure huge in stature and fierce in manner large stablelantern which he held in front of him shone upward upon strong heavily moustached face and angry eyes which glared round him into every recess of the vault finally fixing themselves with deadly stare upon my companion and myself who the devil are you he thundered and what are you doing upon my property then as holmes returned no answer he took couple of steps forward and raised heavy stick which he carried do you hear me he cried who are you what are you doing here his cudgel quivered in the air but instead of shrinking holmes advanced to meet him also have question to ask you sir robert he said in his sternest tone who is this and what is it doing here he turned and tore open the coffinlid behind him in the glare of the lantern saw body swathed in sheet from head to foot with dreadful witchlike features all nose and chin projecting at one end the dim glazed eyes staring from discoloured and crumbling face the baronet had staggered back with cry and supported himself against stone sarcophagus how came you to know of this he cried and then with some return of his truculent manner what business is it of yours my name is sherlock holmes said my companion pos sibly it is familiar to you in any case my business is that of every other good citizen to uphold the law it seems to me that you have much to answer for sir robert glared for moment but holmes quiet voice and cool assured manner had their effect fore god mr holmes it all right said he appear ances are against me ll admit but could act no otherwise should be happy to think so but fear your explanations must be before the police sir robert shrugged his broad shoulders well if it must be it must come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what judge from the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers to be the gunroom of the old house it was comfortably furnished and here sir robert left us for few moments when he returned he had two companions with him the one the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage the other small ratfaced man with disagreeably furtive manner these two wore an appearance of utter bewilderment which showed that the baronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken there said sir robert with wave of his hand are mr and mrs norlett mrs norlett under her maiden name of evans has for some years been my sister confidential maid have brought them here because feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what say is this necessary sir robert have you thought what you are doing cried the woman as to me entirely disclaim all responsibility said her husband sir robert gave him glance of contempt will take all responsibility said he now mr holmes listen to plain statement of the facts you have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or should not have found you where did therefore you know already in all probability that am running dark horse for the derby and that everything depends upon my success if win all is easy if lose well dare not think of that understand the position said holmes am dependent upon my sister lady beatrice for every thing but it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only for myself am deeply in the hands of the jews have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like flock of vultures everything would be seized my stables my horses everything well mr holmes my sister did die just week ago and you told no one what could do absolute ruin faced me if could stave things off for three weeks all would be well her maid husband this man here is an actor it came into our heads it came into my head that he could for that short period personate my sister it was but case of appearing daily in the carriage for no one need enter her room save the maid it was not difficult to arrange my sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her that will be for coroner to decide her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end well what did you do the body could not remain there on the first night norlett and carried it out to the old wellhouse which is now never used we were followed however by her pet spaniel which yapped continually at the door so felt some safer place was needed got rid of the spaniel and we carried the body to the crypt of the church there was no indignity or irreverence mr holmes do not feel that have wronged the dead your conduct seems to me inexcusable sir robert the baronet shook his head impatiently it is easy to preach said he perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position one can not see all one hopes and all one plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them it seemed to me that it would be no unworthy restingplace if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husband ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground we opened such coffin removed the contents and placed her as you have seen her as to the old relics which we took out we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt norlett and removed them and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace there is my story mr holmes though how you forced my hand so that have to tell it is more than can say holmes sat for some time lost in thought there is one flaw in your narrative sir robert he said at last your bets on the race and therefore your hopes for the future would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate the horse would be part of the estate what do they care for my bets as likely as not they would not run him at all my chief creditor is unhappily my most bitter enemy rascally fellow sam brewer whom was once compelled to horsewhip on newmarket heath do you suppose that he would try to save me well sir robert said holmes rising this matter must of course be referred to the police it was my duty to bring the facts to light and there must leave it as to the morality or decency of your conduct it is not for me to express an opinion it is nearly midnight watson and think we may make our way back to our humble abode it is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon happier note than sir robert actions deserved shoscombe prince did win the derby the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in bets and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over when they were paid in full and enough was left to reestablish sir robert in fair position in life both police and coroner took lenient view of the transaction and beyond mild censure for the delay in registering the ladys decease the lucky owner got away scatheless from this strange incident in career which has now outlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age
