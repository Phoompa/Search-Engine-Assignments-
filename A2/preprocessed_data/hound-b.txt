those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night was seated at the breakfast table stood upon the hearthrug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before it was fine thick piece of wood bulbousheaded of the sort which is known as penang law yer just under the head was broad silver band nearly an inch across to james mortimer mrcs from his friends of the cch was engraved upon it with the date 1884 it was just such stick as the oldfashioned family practitioner used to carry dignified solid and reassuring well watson what do you make of it holmes was sitting with his back to me and had given him no sign of my occupation how did you know what was doing believe you have eyes in the back of your head have at least wellpolished silverplated coffeepot in front of me said he but tell me watson what do you make of our visitor stick since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand this accidental souvenir becomes of importance let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it think said following as far as could the methods of my companion that dr mortimer is successful elderly medical man wellesteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation good said holmes excellent think also that the probability is in favour of his being country practitioner who does great deal of his visiting on foot why so because this stick though originally very handsome one has been so knocked about that can hardly imagine town practitioner carrying it the thickiron ferrule is worn down so it is evident that he has done great amount of walking with it perfectly sound said holmes and then again there is the friends of the cch should guess that to be the something hunt the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance and which has made him small presentation in return really watson you excel yourself said holmes pushing back his chair and lighting cigarette am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities it may be that you are not yourself luminous but you are conductor of light some people without possessing genius have remarkable power of stimulating it confess my dear fellow that am very much in your debt he had never said as much before and must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure for had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which had made to give publicity to his methods was proud too to think that had so far mastered his system as to apply it in way which earned his approval he now took the stick from my hands and examined it for few minutes with his naked eyes then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette and carrying the cane to the window he looked over it again with convex lens interesting though elementary said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee there are certainly one or two indications upon the stick it gives us the basis for several deductions has anything escaped me asked with some self importance trust that there is nothing of consequence which have overlooked am afraid my dear watson that most of your conclusions were erroneous when said that you stimulated me meant to be frank that in noting your fallacies was occasionally guided towards the truth not that you are entirely wrong in this in stance the man is certainly country practitioner and he walks good deal then was right to that extent but that was all no no my dear watson not all by no means all would suggest for example that presentation to doctor is more likely to come from hospital than from hunt and that when the initials cc are placed before that hospital the words charing cross very naturally suggest themselves you may be right the probability lies in that direction and if we take this as working hypothesis we have fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor well then supposing that cch does stand for charing cross hospital what further inferences may we draw do none suggest themselves you know my methods apply them can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country think that we might venture little farther than this look at it in this light on what occasion would it be most probable that such presentation would be made when would his friends unite to give him pledge of their good will obviously at the moment when dr mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself we know there has been presentation we believe there has been change from town hospital to country practice is it then stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change it certainly seems probable now you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of ohe hospital since only man wellestablished in london practice could hold such position and such one would not drift into the country what was he then if he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been housesurpeon or housephysician little more than senior student and he left five years ago the date is on the stick so your grave middleaged family practitioner vanishes into thin air my dear watson and there emerges young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absentminded and the possessor of favourite dog which should describe roughly as being larger than terrier and smaller than mastiff laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling as to the latter part have no means of checking you said but at least it is not difficult to find out few particulars about the man age and professional career from my small medical shelf took down the medical directory and turned up the name there were several mortimers but only one who could be our visitor read his record aloud mortimer james mrcs 1882 grimpen dartmoor devon housesurgeon from 1882 to 1884 at charing cross hospital winner of the jackson prize for compara tive pathology with essay entitled is disease reversion corresponding member of the swedish pathological soci ety author of some freaks of atavism lancet 1882 do we progress journal of psychology march 1883 medical officer for the parishes of grimpen thorsley and high barrow no mention of that local hunt watson said holmes with mischievous smile but country doctor as you very astutely observed think that am fairly justified in my inferences as to the adjectives said if remember right amiable unambi tious and absentminded it is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials only an unambitious one who abandons london career for the country and only an absentminded one who leaves his stick and not his visitingcard after waiting an hour in your room and the dog has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master being heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible the dog jaw as shown in the space between these marks is too broad in my opinion for terrier and not broad enough for mastiff it may have been yes by jove it is curlyhaired spaniel he had risen and paced the room as he spoke now he halted in the recess of the window there was such ring of conviction in his voice that glanced up in surprise my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that for the very simple reason that see the dog himself on our very doorstep and there is the ring of its owner do nt move beg you watson he is professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to me now is the dramatic moment of fate watson when you hear step upon the stair which is walking into your life and you know not whether for good or ill what does dr james mortimer the man of science ask of sherlock holmes the specialist in crime come in the appearance of our visitor was surprise to me since had expected typical country practitioner he was very tall thin man with long nose like beak which jutted out between two keen gray eyes set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind pair of goldrimmed glasses he was clad in professional but rather slovenly fashion for his frockcoat was dingy and his trousers frayed though young his long back was already bowed and he walked with forward thrust of his head and general air of peering benevolence as he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in holmes hand and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy am so very glad said he was not sure whether had left it here or in the shipping office would not lose that stick for the world presentation see said holmes yes sir from charing cross hospital from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage dear dear that bad said holmes shaking his head dr mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment why was it bad only that you have disarranged our little deductions your marriage you say yes sir married and so left the hospital and with it all hopes of consulting practice it was necessary to make home of my own come come we are not so far wrong after all said holmes and now dr james mortimer mister sir mister humble mrcs and man of precise mind evidently dabbler in science mr holmes picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean presume that it is mr sherlock holmes whom am addressing and not no this is my friend dr watson glad to meet you sir have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend you interest me very much mr holmes had hardly expected so dolichocephalic skull or such wellmarked supraorbital development would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure cast of your skull sir until the original is available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum it is not my intention to be fulsome but confess that covet your skull sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into chair you are an enthusiast in your line of thought perceive sir as am in mine said he observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes have no hesitation in lighting one the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity he had long quivering fin gers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect holmes was silent but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion presume sir said he at last that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today no sir no though am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well came to you mr holmes because recognized that am myself an unpractical man and because am suddenly confronted with most serious and extraordinary prob lem recognizing as do that you are the second highest expert in europe indeed sir may inquire who has the honour to be the first asked holmes with some asperity to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of mon sieur bertillon must always appeal strongly then had you not better consult him said sir to the precisely scientific mind but as practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone trust sir that have not inadvertently just little said holmes think dr mortimer you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance chapter the curse of the baskervilles have in my pocket manuscript said dr james mortimer observed it as you entered the room said holmes it is an old manuscript early eighteenth century unless it is forgery how can you say that sir you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking it would be poor expert who could not give the date of document within decade or so you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject put that at 1730 the exact date is 1742 dr mortimer drew it from his breastpocket this family paper was committed to my care by sir charles baskerville whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in devonshire may say that was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant he was strongminded man sir shrewd practical and as unimaginative as am myself yet he took this document very seriously and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee you will observe watson the alternative use of the long and the short it is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script at the head was written baskerville hall and below in large scrawling figures 1742 it appears to be statement of some sort yes it is statement of certain legend which runs in the baskerville family but understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me most modern most practical pressing matter which must be decided within twentyfour hours but the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair with your permission will read it to you holmes leaned back in his chair placed his fingertips to gether and closed his eyes with an air of resignation dr mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in high cracking voice the following curious oldworld narrative of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have been many statements yet as come in direct line from hugo baskerville and as had the story from my father who also had it from his have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth and would have you believe my sons that the same justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past but rather to be circumspect in the future that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing know then that in the time of the great rebellion the history of which by the learned lord clarendon most earnestly commend to your attention this manor of basker ville was held by hugo of that name nor can it be gainsaid that he was most wild profane and godless man this in truth his neighbours might have pardoned seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts but there was in him certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name by word through the west it chanced that this hugo came to love if indeed so dark passion may be known under so bright name the daughter of yeoman who held lands near the baskerville estate but the young maiden being discreet and of good repute would ever avoid him for she feared his evil name so it came to pass that one michaelmas this hugo with five or six of his idle and wicked compan ions stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden her father and brothers being from home as he well knew when they had brought her to the hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber while hugo and his friends sat down to long carouse as was their nightly custom now the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below for they say that the words used by hugo baskerville when he was in wine were such as might blast the man who said them at last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered and still covers the south wall she came down from under the eaves and so homeward across the moor there being three leagues betwixt the hall and her fathers farm it chanced that some little time later hugo left his guests to carry food and drink with other worse things perchance to his captive and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped then as it would seem he became as one that hath devil for rushing down the stairs into the dininghall he sprang upon the great table flagons and trenchers flying before him and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the wench and while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man one more wicked or it may be more drunken than the rest cried out that they should put the hounds upon her whereat hugo ran from the house crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack and giving the hounds kerchief of the maid he swung them to the line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor now for some space the revellers stood agape unable to understand all that had been done in such haste but anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands everything was now in an uproar some calling for their pistols some for their horses and some for another flask of wine but at length some sense came back to their crazed minds and the whole of them thirteen in number took horse and started in pursuit the moon shone clear above them and they rode swiftly abreast taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home they had gone mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt and the man as the story goes was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden with the hounds upon her track but have seen more than that said he for hugo baskerville passed me upon his black mare and there ran mute behind him such hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward but soon their skins turned cold for there came galloping across the moor and the black mare dabbled with white froth went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle then the revellers rode close together for great fear was on them but they still followed over the moor though each had he been alone would have been right glad to have turned his horse head riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds these though known for their valour and their breed were whim pering in cluster at the head of deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the moor some slinking away and some with starting hackles and staring eyes gazing down the narrow valley before them the company had come to halt more sober men as you may guess than when they started the most of them would by no means advance but three of them the boldest or it may be the most drunken rode forward down the goyal now it opened into broad space in which stood two of those great stones still to be seen there which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old the moon was shining bright upon the clearing and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen dead of fear and of fatigue but it was not the sight of her body nor yet was it that of the body of hugo baskerviile lying near her which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare devil roysterers but it was that standing over hugo and plucking at his throat there stood foul thing great black beast shaped like hound yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon and even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of hugo baskerville on which as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life still screaming across the moor one it is said died that very night of what he had seen and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days such is the tale my sons of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since if have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths which have been sudden bloody and mysterious yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence which would not for ever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth genera tion which is threatened in holy writ to that providence my sons hereby commend you and counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister elizabeth when dr mortimer had finished reading this singular narra tive he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr sherlock holmes the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire well said he do you not find it interesting to collector of fairy tales dr mortimer drew folded newspaper out of his pocket now mr holmes we will give you something little more recent this is the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year it is short account of the facts elicited at the death of sir charles baskerville which occurred few days before that date my friend leaned little forward and his expression became intent our visitor readjusted his glasses and began the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville whose name has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate for middevon at the next election has cast gloom over the county though sir charles had resided at baskerville hall for comparatively short period his amia bility of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him in these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line sir charles as is well known made large sums of money in south african speculation more wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them he realized his gains and returned to england with them it is only two years since he took up his resi dence at baskerville hall and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death being himself childless it was his openly expressed desire that the whole country side should within his own lifetime profit by his good fortune and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end his generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles can not be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes sir charles was widower and man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes and bis indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of mar ried couple named barrymore the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper their evidence corroborated by that of several friends tends to show that sir charless health has for some time been impaired and points espe cially to some affection of the heart manifesting itself in changes of colour breathlessness and acute attacks of ner vous depression dr james mortimer the friend and medi cal attendant of the deceased has given evidence to the same effect the facts of the case are simple sir charles baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall the evi dence of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his intention of starting next day for london and had ordered barrymore to prepare his luggage that night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking cigar he never returned at twelve oclock barrymore finding the hall door still open became alarmed and lighting lantern went in search of his master the day had been wet and sir charles foot marks were easily traced down the alley halfway down this walk there is gate which leads out on to the moor there were indications that sir charles had stood for some little time here he then proceeded down the alley and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered one fact which has not been explained is the statement of barrymore that his master footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moorgate and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes one murphy gipsy horsedealer was on the moor at no great distance at the time but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink he declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came no signs of violence were to be discovered upon sir charles person and though the doctor evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion so great that dr mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him it was explained that that is symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion this expla nation was borne out by the postmortem examination which showed longstanding organic disease and the coroners jury returned verdict in accordance with the medical evi dence it is well that this is so for it is obviously of the utmost importance that sir charles heir should settle at the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair it might have been difficult to find tenant for baskerville hall it is under stood that the next of kin is mr henry baskerville if he be still alive the son of sir charles baskerville younger brother the young man when last heard of was in america and inquiries are being instituted with view to informing him of his good fortune dr mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket those are the public facts mr holmes in connection with the death of sir charles baskerville must thank you said sherlock holmes for calling my attention to case which certainly presents some features of interest had observed some newspaper comment at the time but was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the vatican cameos and in my anxiety to oblige the pope lost touch with several interesting english cases this article you say contains all the public facts it does then let me have the private ones he leaned back put his fingertips together and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression in doing so said dr mortimer who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion am telling that which have not confided to anyone my motive for withholding it from the coroner inquiry is that man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse popular superstition had the further motive that baskerville hall as the paper says would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation for both these reasons thought that was justified in telling rather less than knew since no practical good could result from it but with you there is no reason why should not be perfectly frank the moor is very sparsely inhabited and those who live near each other are thrown very much together for this reason saw good deal of sir charles baskerville with the exception of mr frankland of lafter hall and mr stapleton the naturalist there are no other men of education within many miles sir charles was retiring man but the chance of his illness brought us together and community of interests in science kept us so he had brought back much scientific information from south africa and many charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that sir charles nervous system was strained to the break ing point he had taken this legend which have read you exceedingly to heart so much so that although he would walk in his own grounds nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night incredible as it may appear to you mr holmes he was honestly convinced that dreadful fate overhung his family and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of hound the latter question he put to me several times and always with voice which vibrated with excitement can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event he chanced to be at his hall door had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him when saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror whisked round and had just time to catch glimpse of something which took to be large black calf passing at the head of the drive so excited and alarmed was he that was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it it was gone however and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind stayed with him all the evening and it was on that occasion to explain the emotion which he had shown that he confided to my keeping that narrative which read to you when first came mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed but was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excite ment had no justification it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london his heart was knew affected and the constant anxi ety in which he lived however chimerical the cause of it might be was evidently having serious effect upon his health thought that few months among the distractions of town would send him back new man mr stapleton mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health was of the same opinion at the last instant came this terrible catastrophe on the night of sir charles death barrymore the butler who made the discovery sent perkins the groom on horseback to me and as was sitting up late was able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of the event checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest followed the footsteps down the yew alley saw the spot at the moorgate where he seemed to have waited remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point noted that there were no other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel and finally carefully examined the body which had not been touched until my arrival sir charles lay on his face his arms out his fingers dug into the ground and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that could hardly have sworn to his identity thefe was certainly no physical injury of any kind but one false statement was made by barrymore at the inquest he said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body he did not observe any but did some little distance off but fresh and clear footprints footprints man or woman dr mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant and his voice sank almost to whisper as he answered mr holmes they were the footprints of gigantic hound chapter the problem confess at these words shudder passed through me there was thrill in the doctor voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested you saw this as clearly as see you and you said nothing what was the use how was it that no one else saw it the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them thought do nt suppose should have done so had not known this legend there are many sheepdogs on the moor no doubt but this was no sheepdog you say it was large enormous but it had not approached the body no what sort of night was it damp and raw but not actually raining no what is the alley like there are two lines of old yew hedge twelve feet high and impenetrable the walk in the centre is about eight feet across is there anything between the hedges and the walk yes there is strip of grass about six feet broad on either side understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by gate yes the wicketgate which leads on to the moor is there any other opening none so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moorgate there is an exit through summerhouse at the far end had sir charles reached this no he lay about fifty yards from it now tell me dr mortimer and this is important the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass no marks could show on the grass were they on the same side of the path as the moorgate yes they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moorgate you interest me exceedingly another point was the wicket gate closed closed and padlocked how high was it about four feet high then anyone could have got over it yes and what marks did you see by the wicketgate none in particular good heaven did no one examine yes examined myself and found nothing it was all very confused sir charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes how do you know that because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar excellent this is colleague watson after our own heart but the marks he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel could discern no others sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture if had only been there he cried it is evidently case of extraordinary interest and one which presented immense opportu nities to the scientific expert that gravel page upon which might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants oh dr mortimer dr mortimer to think that you should not have called me in you have indeed much to answer for could not call you in mr holmes without disclosing these facts to the world and have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so besides besides why do you hesitate there is realm in which the most acute and most experi enced of detectives is helpless you mean that the thing is supernatural did not positively say so no but you evidently think it since the tragedy mr holmes there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of nature for example find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen creature upon the moor which corresponds with this baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal known to science they all agreed that it was huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral have crossexamined these men one of them hardheaded countryman one farrier and one moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly corresponding to the hellhound of the legend assure you that there is reign of terror in the district and that it is hardy man who will cross the moor at night and you trained man of science believe it to be super natural do not know what to believe holmes shrugged his shoulders have hitherto confined my investigations to this world said he in modest way have combated evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious task yet you must admit that the footmark is material the original hound was material enough to tug mans throat out and yet he was diabolical as well see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists but now dr mortimer tell me this if you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate sir charles death and that you desire me to do it did not say that desired you to do it then how can assist you by advising me as to what should do with sir henry baskerville who arrives at waterloo station dr mortimer looked at his watch in exactly one hour and quarter he being the heir yes on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada from the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way speak now not as medical man but as trustee and executor of sir charles will there is no other claimant presume none the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger baskerville the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles was the elder the second brother who died young is the father of this lad henry the third rodger was the black sheep of the family he came of the old masterful baskerville strain and was the very image they tell me of the family picture of old hugo he made england too hot to hold him fled to central america and died there in 1876 of yellow fever henry is the last of the baskervilles in one hour and five minutes meet him at waterloo station have had wire that he arrived at southampton this morning now mr holmes what would you advise me to do with him why should he not go to the home of his fathers it seems natural does it not and yet consider that every baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate feel sure that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place and yet it can not be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak countryside depends upon his presence all the good work which has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall fear lest should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter and that is why bring the case before you and ask for your advice holmes considered for little time put into plain words the matter is this said he in your opinion there is diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an unsafe abode for baskerville that is your opinion at least might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so exactly but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire devil with merely local powers like parish vestry would be too inconceivable thing you put the matter more flippantly mr holmes than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things your advice then as understand it is that the young man will be as safe in devonshire as in london he comes in fifty minutes what would you recommend recommend sir that you take cab call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry baskerville and then and then you will say nothing to him at all until have made up my mind about the matter how long will it take you to make up your mind twentyfour hours at ten oclock tomorrow dr morti mer will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir henry baskerville with you will do so mr holmes he scribbled the appointment on his shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange peering absent minded fashion holmes stopped him at the head of the stair only one more question dr mortimer you say that before sir charles baskerville death several people saw this apparition upon the moor three people did did any see it after have not heard of any thank you goodmorning holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had congenial task before him going out watson unless can help you no my dear fellow it is at the hour of action that turn to you for aid but this is splendid really unique from some points of view when you pass bradley would you ask him to send up pound of the strongest shag tobacco thank you it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening then should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submined to us this morning knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence constructed alter native theories balanced one against the other and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker street until evening it was nearly nine oclock when found myself in the sittingroom once more my first impression as opened the door was that fire had broken out for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it as entered however my fears were set at rest for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing through the haze had vague vision of holmes in his dressinggown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips several rolls of paper lay around him caught cold watson said he no it this poisonous atmosphere suppose it is pretty thick now that you mention it thick it is intolerable open the window then you have been at your club all day perceive my dear holmes am right certainly but how he laughed at my bewildered expression there is delightful freshness about you watson which makes it pleasure to exercise any small powers which possess at your expense gentleman goes forth on showery and miry day he returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots he has been fixture therefore all day he is not man with intimate friends where then could he have been is it not obvious well it is rather obvious the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes where do you think that have been fixture also on the contrary have been to devonshire in spirit exactly my body has remained in this armchair and has regret to observe consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco after you left sent down to stamford for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor and my spirit has hovered over it all day flatter myself that could find my way about largescale map presume very large he unrolled one section and held it over his knee here you have the particular district which concerns us that is baskerville hall in the middle with wood round it exactly fancy the yew alley though not marked under that name must stretch along this line with the moor as you per ceive upon the right of it this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr mortimer has his headquarters within radius of five miles there are as you see only very few scattered dwellings here is lafter hall which was mentioned in the narrative there is house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton if remember right was his name here are two moorland farm houses high tor and foulmire then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown between and around these scattered points extends the desolate lifeless moor this then is the stage upon which tragedy has been played and upon which we may help to play it again it must be wild place yes the setting is worthy one if the devil did desire to have hand in the affairs of men then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation the devil agents may be of flesh and blood may they not there are two questions waiting for us at the outset the one is whether any crime has been committed at all the second is what is the crime and how was it committed of course if dr mortimer surmise should be correct and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature there is an end of our investigation but we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one think we ll shut that window again if you do nt mind it is singular thing but find that concentrated atmosphere helps concentration of thought have not pushed it to the length of getting into box to think but that is the logical outcome of my convictions have you turned the case over in your mind yes have thought good deal of it in the course of the day what do you make of it it is very bewildering it has certainly character of its own there are points of distinction about it that change in the footprints for example what do you make of that mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest why should man walk on tiptoe down the alley what then he was running watson running desperately running for his life running until he burst his heartand fell dead upon his face running from what there lies our problem there are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run how can you say that am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor if that were so and it seems most probable only man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it if the gipsy evidence may be taken as true he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be then again whom was he waiting for that night and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house you think that he was waiting for someone the man was elderly and infirm we can understand his taking an evening stroll but the ground was damp and the night inclement is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes as dr mortimer with more practical sense than should have given him credit for deduced from the cigar ash but he went out every evening think it unlikely that he waited at the moorgate every evening on the contrary the evidence is that he avoided the moor that night he waited there it was the night before he made his departure for london the thing takes shape watson it becomes coherent might ask you to hand me my violin and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting dr mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning chapter sir henry baskerville our breakfast table was cleared early and holmes waited in his dressinggown for the promised interview our clients were punc tual to their appointment for the clock had just struck ten when dr mortimer was shown up followed by the young baronet the latter was small alert darkeyed man about thirty years of age very sturdily built with thick black eyebrows and strong pugnacious face he wore ruddytinted tweed suit and had the weatherbeaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman this is sir henry baskerville said dr mortimer why yes said he and the strange thing is mr sherlock holmes that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning should have come on my own account understand that you think out little puzzles and ve had one this morning which wants more thinking out than am able to give it pray take seat sir henry do understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london nothing of much importance mr holmes only joke as like as not it was this letter if you can call it letter which reached me this morning he laid an envelope upon the table and we all bent over it it was of common quality grayish in colour the address sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel was printed in rough characters the postmark charing cross and the date of posting the preceding evening who knew that you were going to the northumberland ho tel asked holmes glancing keenly across at our visitor no one could have known we only decided after met dr mortimer but dr mortimer was no doubt already stopping there no had been staying with friend said the doctor there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel hum someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements out of the envelope he took halfsheet of fools cap paper folded into four this he opened and spread flat upon the table across the middle of it single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it it ran as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor the word moor only was printed in ink now said sir henry baskerville perhaps you will tell me mr holmes what in thunder is the meaning of that and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs what do you make of it dr mortimer you must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this at any rate no sir but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural what business asked sir henry sharply it seems to me that all you gentlemen know great deal more than do about my own affairs you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir henry promise you that said sherlock holmes we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening have you yesterday times watson it is here in the corner might trouble you for it the inside page please with the leading articles he glanced swiftly over it running his eyes up and down the columns capital article this on free trade permit me to give you an extract from it you may be cajoled into imagining that your own spe cial trade or your own industry will be encouraged by protective tariff but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country diminish the value of our imports and lower the general conditions of life in this island what do you think of that watson cried holmes in high glee rubbing his hands together with satisfaction do nt you think that is an admirable sentiment dr mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional interest and sir henry baskerville turned pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me do nt know much about the tariff and things of that kind said he but it seems to me we ve got bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned on the contrary think we are particularly hot upon the trail sir henry watson here knows more about my methods than you do but fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence no confess that see no connection and yet my dear watson there is so very close connec tion that the one is extracted out of the other you your your life reason value keep away from the dont you see now whence these words have been taken by thunder you re right well if that is nt smart cried sir henry if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that keep away and from the are cut out in one piece well now so it is really mr holmes this exceeds anything which could have imagined said dr mortimer gazing at my friend in amazement could understand anyone saying that the words were from newspaper but that you should name which and add that it came from the leading article is really one of the most remarkable things which have ever known how did you do it presume doctor that you could tell the skull of negro from that of an esquimau most certainly but how because that is my special hobby the differences are obvi ous the supraorbital crest the facial angle the maxillary curve the but this is my special hobby and the differences are equally obvious there is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of times article and the slovenly print of an evening halfpenny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau the detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime though confess that once when was very young confused the leeds mercury with the western morning news but times leader is entirely distinctive and these words could have been taken from nothing else as it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yester day issue so far as can follow you then mr holmes said sir henry baskerville someone cut out this message with scissors nailscissors said holmes you can see that it was very shortbladed scissors since the cutter had to take two snips over keep away that is so someone then cut out the message with pair of shortbladed scissors pasted it with paste gum said holmes with gum on to the paper but want to know why the word moor should have been written because he could not find it in print the other words were all simple and might be found in any issue but moor would be less common why of course that would explain it have you read any thing else in this message mr holmes there are one or two indications and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues the address you observe is printed in rough characters but the times is paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated we may take it therefore that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known or come to be known by you again you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line but that some are much higher than others life for example is quite out of its proper place that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter on the whole incline to the latter view since the matter was evidently important and it is unlikely that the composer of such letter would be careless if he were in hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in hurry since any letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he would leave his hotel did the composer fear an interruption and from whom we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork said dr mortimer say rather into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely it is the scientific use of the imagina tion but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation now you would call it guess no doubt but am almost certain that this address has been written in hotel how in the world can you say that if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble the pen has spluttered twice in single word and has run dry three times in short address showing that there was very little ink in the bottle now private pen or inkbottle is seldom allowed to be in such state and the combination of the two must be quite rare but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it is rare to get anything else yes have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the wastepaper baskets of the hotels around charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message halloa halloa what this he was carefully examining the foolscap upon which the words were pasted holding it only an inch or two from his eyes well nothing said he throwing it down it is blank half sheet of paper without even watermark upon it think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter and now sir henry has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in london why no mr holmes think not you have not observed anyone follow or watch you seem to have walked right into the thick of dime novel said our visitor why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me we are coming to that you have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter well it depends upon what you think worth reporting think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting sir henry smiled do nt know much of british life yet for have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada but hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here you have lost one of your boots my dear sir cried dr mortimer it is only mislaid you will find it when you return to the hotel what is the use of troubling mr holmes with trifles of this kind well he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine exactly said holmes however foolish the incident may seem you have lost one of your boots you say well mislaid it anyhow put them both outside my door last night and there was only one in the morning could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them the worst of it is that only bought the pair last night in the strand and have never had them on if you have never worn them why did you put them out to be cleaned they were tan boots and had never been varnished that was why put them out then understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you went out at once and bought pair of boots did good deal of shopping dr mortimer here went round with me you see if am to be squire down there must dress the part and it may be that have got little careless in my ways out west among other things bought these brown boots gave six dollars for them and had one stolen before ever had them on my feet it seems singularly useless thing to steal said sherlock holmes confess that share dr mortimer belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found and now gentlemen said the baronet with decision it seems to me that have spoken quite enough about the little that know it is time that you kept your promise and gave me full account of what we are all driving at your request is very reasonable one holmes answered dr mortimer think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us thus encouraged our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise well seem to have come into an inheritance with ven geance said he when the long narrative was finished of course ve heard of the hound ever since was in the nursery it the pet story of the family though never thought of taking it seriously before but as to my uncle death well it all seems boiling up in my head and ca nt get it clear yet you do nt seem quite to have made up your mind whether it case for policeman or clergyman precisely and now there this affair of the letter to me at the hotel suppose that fits into its place it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor said dr mortimer and also said holmes that someone is not illdisposed towards you since they warn you of danger or it may be that they wish for their own purposes to scare me away well of course that is possible also am very much indebted to you dr mortimer for introducing me to problem which presents several interesting alternatives but the practical point which we now have to decide sir henry is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall why should not go there seems to be danger do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings well that is what we have to find out whichever it is my answer is fixed there is no devil in hell mr holmes and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer his dark brows knitted and his face flushed to dusky red as he spoke it was evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative meanwhile said he have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me it big thing for man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting should like to have quiet hour by myself to make up my mind now look here mr holmes it halfpast eleven now and am going back right away to my hotel suppose you and your friend dr watson come round and lunch with us at two ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me is that convenient to you watson perfectly then you may expect us shall have cab called prefer to walk for this affair has flurried me rather ll join you in walk with pleasure said his companion then we meet again at two oclock au revoir and good morning we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door in an instant holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action your hat and boots watson quick not moment to lose he rushed into his room in his dressinggown and was back again in few seconds in frockcoat we hurried together down the stairs and into the street dr mortimer and baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street shall run on and stop them not for the world my dear watson am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine our friends are wise for it is certainly very fine morning for walk he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half then still keeping hundred yards behind we followed into oxford street and so down regent street once our friends stopped and stared into shop window upon which holmes did the same an instant after wards he gave little cry of satisfaction and following the direction of his eager eyes saw that hansom cab with man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again there our man watson come along we ll have good look at him if we can do no more at that instant was aware of bushy black beard and pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up something was screamed to the driver and the cab flew madly off down regent street holmes looked eagerly round for another but noempty one was in sight then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start was too great and already the cab was out of sight there now said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles was ever such bad luck and such bad management too watson watson if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes who was the man have not an idea spy well it was evident from what we have heard that basker ville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen if they had followed him the first day argued that they would follow him also the second you may have observed that twice strolled over to the window while dr mortimer was reading his legend yes remember was looking out for loiterers in the street but saw none we are dealing with clever man watson this matter cuts very deep and though have not finally made up my mind whether it is benevolent or malevolent agency which is in touch with us am conscious always of power and design when our friends left at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant so wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot but he had availed himself of cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take cab he was all ready to follow them it has however one obvious disadvantage it puts him in the power of the cabman exactly what pity we did not get the number my dear watson clumsy as have been you surely do not seriously imagine that neglected to get the number no 2704 is our man but that is no use to us for the moment fail to see how you could have done more on observing the cab should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction should then at my leisure have hired second cab and followed the first at respectful distance or better still have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited there when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for as it is by an indiscreet eagerness which was taken advantage of with extraor dinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this conversation and dr mortimer with his companion had long vanished in front of us there is no object in our following them said holmes the shadow has departed and will not return we must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision could you swear to that man face within the cab could swear only to the beard and so could from which gather that in all probability it was false one clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for beard save to conceal his features come in here watson he turned into one of the district messenger offices where he was warmly greeted by the manager ah wilson see you have not forgotten the little case in which had the good fortune to help you no sir indeed have not you saved my good name and perhaps my life my dear fellow you exaggerate have some recollection wilson that you had among your boys lad named cartwright who showed some ability during the investigation yes sir he is still with us could you ring him up thank you and should be glad to have change of this fivepound note lad of fourteen with bright keen face had obeyed the summons of the manager he stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective let me have the hotel directory said holmes thank you now cartwright there are the names of twentythree hotels here all in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross do you see yes sir you will visit each of these in turn yes sir you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling here are twentythree shillings yes sir you will tell him that you want to see the wastepaper of yesterday you will say that an important telegram has miscar ried and that you are looking for it you understand yes sir but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the times with some holes cut in it with scissors here is copy of the times it is this page you could easily recognize it could you not yes sir in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give shilling here are twentythree shillings you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twentythree that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed in the three other cases you will be shown heap of paper and you will look for this page of the times among it the odds are enormously against your finding it there are ten shillings over in case of emergencies let me have report by wire at baker street before evening and now watson it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no 2704 and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel chapter three broken threads sherlock holmes had in very remarkable degree the power of detaching his mind at will for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters he would talk of nothing but art of which he had the crudest ideas from our leaving the gallery until we found our selves at the northumberland hotel sir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you said the clerk he asked me to show you up at once when you came have you any objection to my looking at your register said holmes not in the least the book showed that two names had been added after that of baskerville one was theophilus johnson and family of new castle the other mrs oldmore and maid of high lodge alton surely that must be the same johnson whom used to know said holmes to the porter lawyer is he not gray headed and walks with limp no sir this is mr johnson the coalowner very active gentleman not older than yourself surely you are mistaken about his trade no sir he has used this hotel for many years and he is very well known to us ah that settles it mrs oldmore too seem to remember the name excuse my curiosity but often in calling upon one friend one finds another she is an invalid lady sir her husband was once mayor of gloucester she always comes to us when she is in town thank you am afraid can not claim her acquaintance we have established most important fact by these questions wat son he continued in low voice as we went upstairs together we know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel that means that while they are as we have seen very anxious to watch him they are equally anxious that he should not see them now this is most suggestive fact what does it suggest it suggests halloa my dear fellow what on earth is the matter as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against sir henry baskerville himself his face was flushed with anger and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands so furious was he that he was hardly articulate and when he did speak it was in much broader and more western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning seems to me they are playing me for sucker in this hotel he cried they ll find they ve stafted in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful by thunder if that chap cant find my missing boot there will be trouble can take joke with the best mr holmes but they ve got bit over the mark this time still looking for your boot yes sir and mean to find it but surely you said that it was new brown boot so it was sir and now it an old black one what you do nt mean to say that just what do mean to say only had three pairs in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leath ers which am wearing last night they took one of my brown ones and today they have sneaked one of the black well have you got it speak out man and do nt stand staring an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene no sir have made inquiry all over the hotel but can hear no word of it well either that boot comes back before sundown or ll see the manager and tell him that go right straight out of this hotel it shall be found sir promise you that if you will have little patience it will be found mind it is for it the last thing of mine that ll lose in this den of thieves well well mr holmes you ll excuse my troubling you about such trifle think it well worth troubling about why you look very serious over it how do you explain it just do nt attempt to explain it it seems the very maddest queerest thing that ever happened to me the queerest perhaps said holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well do nt profess to understand it yet this case of yours is very complex sir henry when taken in conjunction with your uncle death am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which have handled there is one which cuts so deep but we hold several threads in our hands and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth we may waste time in following the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right we had pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together it was in the private sittingroom to which we afterwards repaired that holmes asked baskerville what were his intentions to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole said holmes think that your decision is wise one have ample evidence that you are being dogged in london and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be if their intentions are evil they might do you mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you did not know dr moftimer that you were followed this morning from my house dr mortimer started violently followed by whom that unfortunately is what can not tell you have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on daftmoor any man with black full beard no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charless butler is man with full black beard ha where is baffymore he is in charge of the hall we had best ascertain if he is really there or if by any possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me telegraph form is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall what is the nearest telegraphoffice grimpen very good we will send second wire to the postmaster grimpen telegram to mr barrymore to be delivered into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his post in devonshire or not that so said baskerville by the way dr mortimer who is this barrymore anyhow he is the son of the old caretaker who is dead they have looked after the hall for four generations now so far as know he and his wife are as respectable couple as any in the county at the same time said baskerville it clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the hall these people have mighty fine home and nothing to do that is true did barrymore profit at all by sir charles will asked holmes he and his wife had five hundred pounds each ha did they know that they would receive this yes sir charles was very fond of talking about the provi sions of his wlll that is very interesting hope said dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received legacy from sir charles for also had thousand pounds left to me indeed and anyone else there were many insignificant sums to individuals and large number of public charities the residue all went to sir henry and how much was the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pounds holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise had no idea that so gigantic sum was involved said he sir charles had the reputation of being rich but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities the total value of the estate was close on to million dear me it is stake for which man might well play desperate game and one more question dr mortimer suppos ing that anything happened to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles younger brother died unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who are distant cousins james desmond is an elderly clergyman in westmoreland thank you these details are all of great interest have you met mr james desmond yes he once came down to visit sir charles he is man of venerable appearance and of saintly life remember that he refused to accept any settlement from sir charles though he pressed it upon him and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charles thousands he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed he would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he likes with it and have you made your will sir henry no mr holmes have not ve had no time for it was only yesterday that learned how matters stood but in any case feel that the money should go with the title and estate that was my poor uncle idea how is the owner going to restore the glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property house land and dollars must go together quite so well sir henry am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay there is only one provision which must make you certainly must not go alone dr mortimer returns with me but dr mortimer has his practice to attend to and his house is miles away from yours with all the good will in the world he may be unable to help you no sir henry you must take with you someone trusty man who will be always by your side is it possible that you could come yourself mr holmes if matters came to crisis should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive con sulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time at the present instant one of the most revered names in england is being besmirched by black mailer and only can stop disastrous scandal you will see how impossible it is for me to go to dartmoor whom would you recommend then holmes laid his hand upon my arm if my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in tight place no one can say so more confidently than the proposition took me completely by surprise but before had time to answer baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily well now that is real kind of you dr watson said he you see how it is with me and you know just as much about the matter as do if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through ll never forget it the promise of adventure had always fascination for me and was complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as companion will come with pleasure said do not know how could employ my time better and you will report very carefully to me said holmes when crisis comes as it will do will direct how you shall act suppose that by saturday all might be ready would that suit dr watson perfectly then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the tenthirty train from paddington we had risen to depart when baskerville gave cry of triumph and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew brown boot from under cabinet my missing boot he cried may all our difficulties vanish as easily said sherlock holmes but it is very singular thing dr mortimer remarked searched this room carefully before lunch and so did said baskerville every inch of it there was certainly no boot in it then in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly setting aside the whole grim story of sir charles death we had line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days which included the receipt of the printed letter the blackbearded spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the old black boot and now the return of the new brown boot holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to baker street and knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind like my own was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted all afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought just before dinner two telegrams were handed in the first ran have just heard that barrymore is at the hall baskerville the second visited twentythree hotels as directed but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of times cartwrlght there go two of my threads watson there is nothing more stimulating than case where everything goes against you we must cast round for another scent we have still the cabman who drove the spy exactly haw wired to get his name and address from the official registry should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question the ring at the bell proved to be something even more satis factory than an answer however for the door opened and roughlooking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself got message from the head office that gent at this address had been inquiring for no 2704 said he ve driven my cab this seven years and never word of complaint came here straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had against me have nothing in the world against you my good man said holmes on the contrary have half sovereign for you if you will give me clear answer to my questions well ve had good day and no mistake said the cabman with grin what was it you wanted to ask sir first of all your name and address in case want you again john clayton turpey street the borough my cab is out of shipley yard near waterloo station sherlock holmes made note of it now clayton tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten oclock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down regent street the man looked surprised and little embarrassed why there no good my telling you things for you seem to know as much as do already said he the truth is that the gentleman told me that he was detective and that was to say nothing about him to anyone my good fellow this is very serious business and you may find yourself in pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me you say that your fare told you that he was detective yes he did when did he say this when he left me did he say anything more he mentioned his name holmes cast swift glance of triumph at me oh he men tioned his name did he that was imprudent what was the name that he mentioned his name said the cabman was mr sherlock holmes never have seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman reply for an instant he sat in silent amazement then he burst into hearty laugh touch watson an undeniable touch said he feel foil as quick and supple as my own he got home upon me very prettily that time so his name was sherlock holmes was it yes sir that was the gentleman name excellent tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred he hailed me at halfpast nine in trafalgar square he said that he was detective and he offered me two guineas if would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions was glad enough to agree first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took cab from the rank we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here this very door said holmes well could nt be sure of that but dare say my fare knew all about it we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and half then the two gentlemen passed us walking and we followed down baker street and along know said holmes until we got threequarters down regent street then my gentleman threw up the trap and he cried that should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as could go whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes then he paid up his two guineas like good one and away he went into the station only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr sherlock holmes that how come to know the name see and you saw no more of him not after he went into the station and how would you describe mr sherlock holmes the cabman scratched his head well he was nt altogether such an easy gentleman to describe put him at forty years of age and he was of middle height two or three inches shorter than you sir he was dressed like toff and he had black beard cut square at the end and pale face do nt know as could say more than that colour of his eyes no ca nt say that nothing more that you can remember no sir nothing well then here is your halfsovereign there another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information goodnight goodnight sir and thank you john clayton departed chuckling and holmes turned to me with shrug of his shoulders and rueful smile snap goes our third thread and we end where we began said he the cunning rascal he knew our number knew that sir henry baskerville had consulted me spotted who was in regent street conjectured that had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver and so sent back this audacious message tell you watson this time we have got foeman who is worthy of our steel ve been checkmated in london can only wish you better luck in devonshire but im not easy in my mind about it about what about sending you it an ugly business watson an ugly dangerous business and the more see of it the less like it yes my dear fellow you may laugh but give you my word that shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more chapter baskerville hall sir henry baskerville and dr mortimer were ready upon the appointed day and we started as arranged for devonshire mr sherlock holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspi cions watson said he wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me and you can leave me to do the theorizing what sort of facts asked anything which may seem to have bearing however indi rect upon the case and especially the relations between young baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concern ing the death of sir charles have made some inquiries myself in the last few days but the results have fear been negative one thing only appears to be certain and that is that mr james desmond who is the next heir is an elderly gentleman of very amiable disposition so that this persecution does not arise from him really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations there remain the people who will actually surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor would it not be well in the first place to get rid ofl this barrymore couple by no means you could not make greater mistake if they are innocent it would be cruel injustice and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them no no we will preserve them upon our list of suspects then there is groom at the hall if remember right there are two moorland farmers there is our friend dr mortimer whom believe to be entirely honest and there is his wife of whom we know nothing there is this naturalist stapleton and there is his sister who is said to be young lady of attractions there is mr frankland of lafter hall who is also an unknown factor and there are one or two other neighbours these are the folk who must be your very special study will do my best you have arms suppose yes thought it as well to take them most certainly keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions our friends had already secured firstclass carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform no we have no news of any kind said dr mortimer in answer to my friend questions can swear to one thing and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days we have never gone out without keeping sharp watch and no one could have escaped our notice you have always kept together presume except yesterday afternoon usually give up one day to pure amusement when come to town so spent it at the museum of the college of surgeons and went to look at the folk in the park said baskerville but we had no trouble of any kind it was imprudent all the same said holmes shaking his head and looking very grave beg sir henry that you will not go about alone some great misfortune will befall you if you do did you get your other boot no sir it is gone forever indeed that is very interesting well goodbye he added as the train began to glide down the platform bear in mind sir henry one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted looked back at the plafform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall austere figure of holmes standing motionless and gazing after us the journey was swift and pleasant one and spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with dr mortimer spaniel in very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy the brick had changed to granite and red cows grazed in wellhedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of richer if damper climate young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the famil ar features of the devon scenery ve been over good part of the world since left it dr watson said he but have never seen place to compare with it never saw devonshire man who did not swear by his county remarked it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county said dr mortimer glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the celt which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment poor sir charless head was of very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristics but you were very young when you last saw baskerville hall were you not was boy in my teens at the time of my father death and had never seen the hall for he lived in little cottage on the south coast thence went straight to friend in america tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr watson and as keen as possible to see the moor are you then your wish is easily granted for there is your first sight of the moor said dr mortimer pointing out of the carriage window over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of wood there rose in the distance gray melancholy hill with strange jagged summit dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in dream baskerville sat for long time his eyes fixed upon it and read upon his eager face how much it meant to him this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep there he sat with his tweed suit and his american accent in the corner of prosaic railwaycarriage and yet as looked at his dark and expressive face felt more than ever how true descendant he was of that long line of highblooded fiery and masterful men there were pride valour and strength in his thick brows his sensitive nostrils and his large hazel eyes if on that forbidding moor difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us this was at least comrade for whom one might venture to take risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it the train pulled up at small wayside station and we all descended outside beyond the low white fence wagonette with pair of cobs was waiting our coming was evidently great event for stationmaster and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage it was sweet simple country spot but was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two sol dierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed the coachman hard faced gnarled little fellow saluted sir henry baskerville and in few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad white road rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever dark against the evening sky the long gloomy curve of the moor broken by the jagged and sinister hills the wagonette swung round into side road and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels high banks on either side heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hartstongue ferns bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun still steadily rising we passed over narrow granite bridge and skirted noisy stream which gushed swiftly down foaming and roaring amid the gray boul ders both road and stream wound up through valley dense with scrub oak and fir at every turn baskerville gave an excla mation of delight looking eagerly about him and asking count less questions to his eyes all seemed beautiful but to me tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed the rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation sad gifts as it seemed to me for nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles halloa cried dr mortimer what is this steep curve of heathclad land an outlying spur of the moor lay in front of us on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal was mounted soldier dark and stern his rifle poised ready over his forearm he was watching the road along which we travelled what is this perkins asked dr mortimer our driver half turned in his seat there convict escaped from princetown sir he been out three days now and the warders watch every road and every station but they ve had no sight of him yet the farmers about here do nt like it sir and that fact well understand that they get five pounds if they can give information yes sir but the chance of five pounds is but poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut you see it is nt like any ordinary convict this is man that would stick at nothing who is he then it is selden the notting hill murderer remembered the case well for it was one in which holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin the commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity so atrocious was his conduct our wagonette had topped rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor mottled with gnarled and craggy caims and tors cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering somewhere there on that desolate plain was lurking this fiendish man hiding in burrow like wild beast his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out it needed but this to complete the grim suggestive ness of the barren waste the chilling wind and the darkling sky even baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us we looked back on it now the slanting rays of low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands the road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes sprinkled with giant boulders now and then we passed moorland cottage walled and roofed with stone with no creeper to break its harsh outline suddenly we looked down into cuplike depression patched with stunted oaks and fus which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm two high narrow towers rose over the trees the driver pointed with his whip baskerville hall said he its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes few minutes later we had reached the lodge gates maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron with weather bitten pillars on either side blotched with lichens and summounted by the boars heads of the baskervilles the lodge was ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters but facing it was new building half constructed the first fruit of sir charles south african gold through the gateway we passed into the avenue where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves and the old trees shot their branches in sombre tunnelover our heads baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long dark drive to where the house glimmered like ghost at the farther end was it here he asked in low voice no no the yew alley is on the other side the young heir glanced round with gloomy face it no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such place as this said he it enough to scare any man ll have row of electric lamps up here inside of six months and you wo nt know it again with thousand candle power swan and edison right here in front of the hall door the avenue opened into broad expanse of turf and the house lay before us in the fading light could see that the centre was heavy block of building from which porch projected the whole front was draped in ivy with patch clipped bare here and there where window or coat of arms broke through the dark veil from this central block rose the twin towers ancient crenellated and pierced with many loopholes to right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep highangled roof there sprang single black column of smoke welcome sir henry welcome to baskerville hall tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette the figure of woman was silhouet ted against the yellow light of the hall she came out and helped the man to hand down our bags you do nt mind my driving straight home sir henry said dr mortimer my wife is expecting me surely you will stay and have some dinner no must go shall probably find some work awaiting me would stay to show you over the house but barrymore will be better guide than goodbye and never hesitate night or day to send for me if can be of service the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and turned into the hall and the door clanged heavily behind us it was fine apartment in which we found ourselves large lofty and heavily raftered with huge baulks of ageblackened oak in the great oldfashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs logfire crackled and snapped sir henry and held out our hands to it for we were numb from our long drive then we gazed round us at the high thin window of old stained glass the oak panelling the stags heads the coats of arms upon the walls all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp it just as imagined it said sir henry is it not the very picture of an old family home to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived it strikes me solemn to think of it saw his dark face lit up with boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him the light beat upon him where he stood but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like black canopy above him barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of welltrained servant he was remarkablelooking man tall handsome with square black beard and pale distinguished features would you wish dinner to be served at once sir is it ready in very few minutes sir you will find hot water in your rooms my wife and will be happy sir henry to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require considerable staff what new conditions only meant sir that sir charles led very retired life and we were able to look after his wants you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need changes in your household do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave only when it is quite convenient to you sir but your family have been with us for several generations have they not should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butlers white face feel that also sir and so does my wife but to tell the truth sir we were both very much attached to sir charles and his death gave us shock and made these surroundings very painful to us fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at baskerville hall but what do you intend to do have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business sir charles generosity has given us the means to do so and now sir perhaps had best show you to your rooms square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall approached by double stair from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building from which all the bedrooms opened my own was in the same wing as baskerville and almost next door to it these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind but the diningroom which opened out of the hall was place of shadow and gloom it was long chamber with step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents at one end minstrel gallery overlooked it black beams shot across above our heads with smokedarkened ceiling beyond them with rows of flaring torches to light it up and the colour and rude hilarity of an oldtime banquet it might have softened but now when two black clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by shaded lamp one voice became hushed and one spirit sub dued dim line of ancestors in every variety of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company we talked little and for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiardroom and smoke cigarette my word it is nt very cheerful place said sir henry suppose one can tone down to it but feel bit out of the picture at present do nt wonder that my uncle got little jumpy if he lived all alone in such house as this however if it suits you we will retire early tonight and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning drew aside my curtains before went to bed and looked out from my window it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door beyond two copses of trees moaned and swung in rising wind half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds in its cold light saw beyond the trees broken fringe of rocks and the long low curve of the melancholy moor closed the curtain feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest and yet it was not quite the last found myself weary and yet wakeful tossing restlessly from side to side seeking for the sleep which would not come far away chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours but otherwise deathly silence lay upon the old house and then suddenly in the very dead of the night there came sound to my ears clear resonant and unmistakable it was the sob of woman the muffled strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow sat up in bed and listened intently the noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house for half an hour waited with every nerve on the alert but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall chapter the stapletons of merripit house the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall as sir henry and sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such gloom into our souls upon the evening before guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame said the baronet we were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive so we took gray view of the place now we are fresh and well so it is all cheerful once more and yet it was not entirely question of imagination answered did you for example happen to hear someone woman think sobbing in the night that is curious for did when was half asleep fancy that heard something of the sort waited quite time but there was no more of it so concluded that it was all dream heard it distinctly and am sure that it was really the sob of woman we must ask about this right away he rang the bell and asked barrymore whether he could account for our experience it seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned shade paler still as he listened to his master question there are only two women in the house sir henry he answered one is the scullerymaid who sleeps in the other wing the other is my wife and can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her and yet he lied as he said it for it chanced that after breakfast met mrs barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face she was large impassive heavyfeatured woman with stern set expression of mouth but her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids it was she then who wept in the night and if she did so her husband must know it yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so why had he done this and why did she weep so bitterly already round this palefaced handsome blackbearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mys tery and of gloom it was he who had been the first to discover the body of sir charles and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man death was it possible that it was barrymore after all whom we had seen in the cab in regent street the beard might well have been the same the cabman had described somewhat shorter man but such an impression might easily have been erroneous how could settle the point forever obviously the first thing to do was to see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in barrymore own hands be the answer what it might should at least have something to report to sherlock holmes sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast so that the time was propitious for my excursion it was pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor leading me at last to small gray hamlet in which two larger buildings which proved to be the inn and the house of dr mortimer stood high above the rest the postmaster who was also the village grocer had clear recollection of the telegram certainly sir said he had the telegram delivered to mr barrymore exactly as directed who delivered it my boy here james you delivered that telegram to mr barrymore at the hall last week did you not yes father delivered it into his own hands asked well he was up in the loft at the time so that could not put it into his own hands but gave it into mrs barrymores hands and she promised to deliver it at once did you see mr barrymore no sir tell you he was in the loft if you did nt see him how do you know he was in the loft well surely his own wife ought to know where he is said the postmaster testily did nt he get the telegram if there is any mistake it is for mr barrymore himself to complain it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther but it was clear that in spite of holmes ruse we had no proof that barry more had not been in london all the time suppose that it were so suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen sir charles alive and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to england what then was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own what interest could he have in persecuting the baskerville family thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the times was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes the only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by sir henry that if the family could be scared away comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the barrymores but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young baronet holmes himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations prayed as walked back along the gray lonely road that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of run ning feet behind me and by voice which called me by name turned expecting to see dr mortimer but to my surprise it was stranger who was pursuing me he was small slim clean shaven primfaced man flaxenhaired and leanjawed between thirty and forty years of age dressed in gray suit and wearing straw hat tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried green butterflynet in one of his hands you will am sure excuse my presumption dr watson said he as he came panting up to where stood here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introduc tions you may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend mortimer am stapleton of merripit house your net and box would have told me as much said for knew that mr stapleton was naturalist but how did you know me have been calling on mortimer and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed as our road lay the same way thought that would overtake you and introduce myself trust that sir henry is none the worse for his journey he is very well thank you we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charles the new baronet might refuse to live here it is asking much of wealthy man to come down and bury himself in place of this kind but need not tell you that it means very great deal to the countryside sir henry has suppose no superstitious fears in the matter do not think that it is likely of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family have heard it it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such creature upon the moor he spoke with smile but seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seri ously the story took great hold upon the imagination of sir charles and have no doubt that it led to his tragic end but how his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had fatal effect upon his diseased heart fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley feared that some disaster might occur for was very fond of the old man and knew that his heart was weak how did you know that my friend mortimer told me you think then that some dog pursued sir charles and that he died of fright in consequence have you any better explanation have not come to any conclusion has mr sherlock holmes the words took away my breath for an instant but glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you dr watson said he the records of your detective have reached us here and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity if you are here then it follows that mr sherlock holmes is interesting himself in the matter and am naturally curious to know what view he may take am afraid that can not answer that question may ask if he is going to honour us with visit himsel he can not leave town at present he has other cases which engage his attention what pity he might throw some light on that which is so dark to us but as to your own researches if there is any possible way in which can be of service to you trust that you will command me if had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice assure you that am simply here upon visit to my friend sir henry and that need no help of any kind excellent said stapleton you are perfectly right to be wary and discreet am justly reproved for what feel was an unjustifiable intrusion and promise you that will not mention the matter again we had come to point where narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor steep bouldersprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into granite quarry the face which was turned towards us formed dark cliff with ferns and brambles growing in its niches from over distant rise there floated gray plume of smoke moderate walk along this moorpath brings us to merripit house said he perhaps you will spare an hour that may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister my first thought was that should be by sir henry side but then remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered it was certain that could not help with those and holmes had expressly said that should study the neighbours upon the moor accepted stapleton invitation and we turned together down the path it is wonderful place the moor said he looking round over the undulating downs long green rollers with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges you never tire of the moor you can not think the wonderful secrets which it contains it is so vast and so barren and so mysterious you know it well then have only been here two years the residents would call me newcomer we came shortly after sir charles settled but my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round and should think that there are few men who know it better than do is it hard to know very hard you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it do you observe anything remarkable about that it would be rare place for gallop you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now you notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it yes they seem more fertile than the rest stapleton laughed that is the great grimpen mire said he false step yonder means death to man or beast only yesterday saw one of the moor ponies wander into it he never came out saw his head for quite long time craning out of the boghole but it sucked him down at last even in dry seasons it is danger to cross it but after these autumn rains it is an awful place and yet can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive by george there is another of those miserable ponies something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges then long agonized writhing neck shot upward and dreadful cry echoed over the moor it turned me cold with horror but my companion nerves seemed to be stronger than mme it gone said he the mire has him two in two days and many more perhaps for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches it bad place the great grimpen mire and you say you can penetrate it yes there are one or two paths which very active man can take have found them out but why should you wish to go into so horrible place well you see the hills beyond they are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire which has crawled round them in the course of years that is where the rare plants and the butterflies are if you have the wit to reach them shall try my luck some day he looked at me with surprised face for god sake put such an idea out of your mind said he your blood would be upon my head assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive it is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that am able to do it halloa cried what is that long low moan indescribably sad swept over the moor it filled the whole air and yet it was impossible to say whence it came from dull murmur it swelled into deep roar and then sank back into melancholy throbbing murmur once again stapleton looked at me with curious expression in his face queer place the moor said he but what is it the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for its prey ve heard it once or twice before but never quite so loud looked round with chill of fear in my heart at the huge swelling plain mottled with the green patches of rushes nothing stirred over the vast expanse save pair of ravens which croaked loudly from tor behind us you are an educated man you do nt believe such nonsense as that said what do you think is the cause of so strange sound bogs make queer noises sometimes it the mud settling or the water rising or something no no that was living voice well perhaps it was did you ever hear bittern booming no never did it very rare bird practically extinct in england now but all things are possible upon the moor yes should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns it the weirdest strangest thing that ever heard in my life yes it rather an uncanny place altogether look at the hillside yonder what do you make of those the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone score of them at least what are they sheeppens no they are the homes of our worthy ancestors prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor and as no one in particular has lived there since we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them these are his wigwams with the roofs off you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside but it is quite town when was it inhabited neolithic man no date what did he do he grazed his cattle on these slopes and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe look at the great trench in the opposite hill that is his mark yes you will find some very singular points about the moor dr watson oh excuse me an instant it is surely cyclopides small fly or moth had fluttered across our path and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire and my acquaintance never paused for an instant bounding from tuft to tuft behind it his green net waving in the air his gray clothes and jerky zigzag irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself was standing watching his pursuit with mixture of admiration for his extraor dinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire when heard the sound of steps and turning round found woman near me upon the path she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom had been told since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor and remembered that had heard someone describe her as being beauty the woman who approached me was certainly that and of most uncommon type there could not have been greater contrast between brother and sister for stapleton was neutral tinted with light hair and gray eyes while she was darker than any brunette whom have seen in england slim elegant and tall she had proud finely cut face so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark eager eyes with her perfect figure and elegant dress she was indeed strange apparition upon lonely moorland path her eyes were on her brother as turned and then she quickened her pace towards me had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into new channel go back she said go straight back to london instantly could only stare at her in stupid surprise her eyes blazed at me and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot why should go back asked can not explain she spoke in low eager voice with curious lisp in her utterance but for god sake do what ask you go back and never set foot upon the moor again but have only just come man man she cried can you not tell when warning is for your own good go back to london start tonight get away from this place at all costs hush my brother is coming not word of what have said would you mind getting that orchid for me among the marestails yonder we are very rich in orchids on the moor though of course you are rather late to see the beauties of the place stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions halloa beryl said he and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether cordial one well jack you are very hot yes was chasing cyclopides he is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn what pity that should have missed him he spoke unconcernedly but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me you have introduced yourselves can see yes was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor why who do you think this is imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville no no said only humble commoner but his friend my name is dr watson flush of vexation passed over her expressive face we have been talking at cross purposes said she why you had not very much time for talk her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes talked as if dr watson were resident instead of being merely visitor said she it can not much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids but you will come on will you not and see merripit house short walk brought us to it bleak moorland house once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days but now put into repair and turned into modern dwelling an orchard surrounded it but the trees as is usual upon the moor were stunted and nipped and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy we were admitted by strange wizened rusty coated old manservant who seemed in keeping with the house inside however there were large rooms furnished with an ele gance in which seemed to recognize the taste of the lady as looked from their windows at the interminable graniteflecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such place queer spot to choose is it not said he as if in answer to my thought and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl quite happy said she but there was no ring of conviction in her words had school said stapleton it was in the north coun try the work to man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of living with youth of helping to mould those young minds and of impressing them with ones own character and ideals was very dear to me however the fates were against us serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died it never recovered from the blow and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up and yet if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong tastes for botany and zoology find an unlimited field of work here and my sister is as devoted to nature as am all this dr watson has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window it certainly did cross my mind that it might be little dull less for you perhaps than for your sister no no am never dull said she quickly we have books we have our studies and we have interest ing neighbours dr mortimer is most learned man in his own line poor sir charles was also an admirable companion we knew him well and miss him more than can tell do you think that should intrude if were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of sir henry am sure that he would be delighted then perhaps you would mention that propose to do so we may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surround ings will you come upstairs dr watson and inspect my collection of lepidoptera think it is the most complete one in the southwest of england by the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready but was eager to get back to my charge the melancholy of the moor the death of the unfortunate pony the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the basker villes all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of miss stapleton delivered with such intense earnestness that could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it resisted all pressure to stay for lunch and set off at once upon my return journey taking the grassgrown path by which we had come it seems however that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it for before had reached the road was astounded to see miss stapleton sitting upon rock by the side of the track her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side have run all the way in order to cut you off dr watson said she had not even time to put on my hat must not stop or my brother may miss me wanted to say to you how sorry am about the stupid mistake made in thinking that you were sir henry please forget the words said which have no application whatever to you but ca nt forget them miss stapleton said am sir henry friend and his welfare is very close concern of mine tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should return to london woman whim dr watson when you know me better you will understand that can not always give reasons for what say or do no no remember the thrill in your voice remembe the look in your eyes please please be frank with me miss stapleton for ever since have been here have been conscious of shadows all round me life has become like that great grimpen mire with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track tell me then what it was that you meant and will promise to convey your warning to sir henry an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me you make too much of it dr watson said she my brother and were very much shocked by the death of sir charles we knew him very intimately for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family and when this tragedy came naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here and felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run that was all which intended to convey but what is the danger you know the story of the hound do not believe in such nonsense but do if you have any influence with sir henry take him away from place which has always been fatal to his family the world is wide why should he wish to live at the place of danger because it is the place of danger that is sir henry nature fear that unless you can give me some more definite informa tion than this it would be impossible to get him to move can not say anything definite for do not know anything definite would ask you one more question miss stapleton if you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said there is nothing to which he or anyone else could object my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor he would be very angry if he knew that have said anything which might induce sir henry to go away but have done my duty now and will say no more must go back or he will miss me and suspect that have seen you goodbye she turned and had disappeared in few minutes among the scattered boulders while with my soul full of vague fears pursued my way to baskerville hall chapter first report of dr watson from this point onward will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to mr sherlock holmes which lie before me on the table one page is missing but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory clear as it is upon these tragic events can possibly do baskerville hall october 13th my dear holmes my previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most godforsaken corner of the world the longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one soul its vastness and also its grim charm when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern england behind you but on the other hand you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people on all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples as you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you and if you were to see skinclad hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting flinttipped arrow on to the string of his bow you wouid feel that his presence there was more natural than your own the strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil am no antiquarian but could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy all this however is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun let me therefore return to the facts concerning sir henry baskerville if you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate then very surprising circumstance occurred which shall tell you in due course but first of all must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation one of these concerning which have said little is the escaped convict upon the moor there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away which is considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district fortnight has passed since his flight during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time of course so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all any one of these stone huts would give him hidingplace but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep we think therefore that he has gone and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence we are four ablebodied men in this household so that we could take good care of ourselves but confess that have had uneasy moments when have thought of the stapletons they live miles from any help there are one maid an old manser vant the sister and the brother the latter not very strong man they would be helpless in the hands of desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance both sir henry and were concerned at their situation and it was suggested that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there but stapleton would not hear of it the fact is that our friend the baronet begins to display considerable interest in our fair neighbour it is not to be won dered at for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him and she is very fascinating and beautiful woman there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires he has certainly very marked influence over her for have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said trust that he is kind to her there is dry glitter in his eyes and firm set of his thin lips which goes with positive and possibly harsh nature you would find him an interesting study he came over to call upon baskerville on that first day and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin it was an excursion of some miles across the moor to place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story we found short valley between rugged tors which led to an open grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass in the middle of it rose two great stones worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men he spoke lightly but it was evident that he was very much in earnest stapleton was guarded in his replies but it was easy to see that he said less than he might and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet he told us of similar cases where families had suffered from some evil influence and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house and it was there that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her and am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual he referred to her again and again on our walk home and since then hardly day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister they dine here tonight and there is some talk of our going to them next week one would imagine that such match would be very welcome to stapleton and yet have more than once caught look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when sir henry has been paying some attention to his sister he is much attached to her no doubt and would lead lonely life without her but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant marriage yet am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love and have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being teteatete by the way your instructions to me never to allow sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if love affair were to be added to our other difficulties my popularity would soon suffer if were to carry out your orders to the letter the other day thursday to be more exact dr mortimer lunched with us he has been excavating barrow at long down and has got prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy never was there such singleminded enthusiast as he the stapletons came in afterwards and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at sir henry request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night it is long dismal walk the yew alley between two high walls of clipped hedge with narrow band of grass upon either side at the far end is an old tumbledown summerhouse halfway down is the moor gate where the old gentleman left his cigarash it is white wooden gate with latch beyond it lies the wide moor remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred as the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion there was the long gloomy tunnel down which he fled and from what sheepdog of the moor or spectral hound black silent and monstrous was there human agency in the matter did the pale watchful barrymore know more than he cared to say it was all dim and vague but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it one other neighbour have met since wrote last this is mr frankland of lafter hall who lives some four miles to the south of us he is an elderly man redfaced whitehaired and cho leric his passion is for the british law and he has spent large fortune in litigation he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of question so that it is no wonder that he has found it costly amusement some times he will shut up right of way and defy the parish to make him open it at others he will with his own hands tear down some other man gate and declare that path has existed there from time immemorial defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass he is learned in old manorial and communal rights and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them so that he is periodi cally either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy according to his latest exploit he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future apart from the law he seems kindly goodnatured person and only mention him because you were particular that should send some descrip tion of the people who surround us he is curiously employed at present for being an amateur astronomer he has an excellent telescope with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching glimpse of the escaped convict if he would confine his energies to this all would be well but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute dr mortimer for opening grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on long down he helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives little comic relief where it is badly needed and now having brought you up to date in the escaped convict the stapletons dr mortimer and frankland of lafter hall let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the barrymores and especially about the surprising development of last night first of all about the test telegram which you sent from london in order to make sure that barrymore was really here have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other told sir henry how the matter stood and he at once in his downright fashion had barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself barrymore said that he had did the boy deliver it into your own hands asked sir henry barrymore looked surprised and considered for little time no said he was in the boxroom at the time and my wife brought it up to me did you answer it yourself no told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning sir henry said he trust that they do not mean that have done anything to forfeit your confidence sir henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him considerable part of his old wardrobe the london outfit having now all arrived mrs barrymore is of interest to me she is heavy solid person very limited intensely respectable and inclined to be puritanical you could hardly conceive less emotional subject yet have told you how on the first night here heard her sobbing bitterly and since then have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart sometimes wonder if she has guilty memory which haunts her and sometimes suspect barrymore of being domestic tyrant have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man character but the adven ture of last night brings all my suspicions to head and yet it may seem small matter in itself you are aware that am not very sound sleeper and since have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever last night about two in the morning was aroused by stealthy step passing my room rose opened my door and peeped out long black shadow was trailing down the corridor it was thrown by man who walked softly down the passage with candle held in his hand he was in shirt and trousers with no covering to his feet could merely see the outline but his height told me that it was barrymore he walked very slowly and circumspectly and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall but that it is resumed upon the farther side waited until he had passed out of sight and then followed him when came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor and could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms now all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever the light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless crept down the passage as noiselessly as could and peeped round the corner of the door barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass his profile was half turned towards me and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor for some minutes he stood watching intently then he gave deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly made my way back to my room and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey long afterwards when had fallen into light sleep heard key turn somewhere in lock but could not tell whence the sound came what it all means can not guess but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of do not trouble you with my theories for you asked me to furnish you only with facts have had long talk with sir henry this morning and we have made plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interesting reading chapter second report of dr watson the light upon the moor baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that am making up for lost time and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us in my last report ended upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now have quite budget already which will unless am much mistaken considera bly surprise you things have taken turn which could not have anticipated in some ways they have within the last forty eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated but will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning following my adventure went down the corridor and examined the room in which barry more had been on thenight before the western window through which he had stared so intently has noticed one peculiarity above all other windows in the house it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor there is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other windows it is only distant glimpse which can be obtained it follows therefore that barry more since only this window would serve the purpose must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor the night was very dark so that can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man is strikinglooking fellow very well equipped to steal the heart of country girl so that this theory seemed to have something to support it that opening of the door whlch had heard after had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment so reasoned with myself in the morning and tell you the direction of my suspicions however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore movements might be felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until could explain them was more than could bear had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and told him all that had seen he was less surprised than had expected knew that barrymore walked about nights and had mind to speak to him about it said he two or three times have heard hls steps in the passage coming and going just about the hour you name perhaps then he pays visit every night to that particular window suggested perhaps he does if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after wonder what your friend holmes would do if he were here believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest said he would follow barrymore and see what he did then we shall do it together but surely he would hear us the man is rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that we ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes sir henry rubbed his hands with pleasure and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for sir charles and with contractor from london so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon there have been decorators and furnishers up from plym outh and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house is renovated and refurnished all that he will need will be wife to make it complete between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing for have seldom seen man more infatuated with woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect today for example its surface was broken by very unexpected ripple which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which have quoted about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepared to go out as matter of course did the same what are you coming watson he asked looking at me in curious way that depends on whether you are going on the moor said yes am well you know what my instructions are am sorry to intrude but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with pleasant smile my dear fellow said he holmes with all his wisdom did not foresee some things which have happened since have been on the moor you understand me am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be spoilsport must go out alone it put me in most awkward position was at loss what to say or what to do and before had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone but when came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight imagined what my feelings would be if had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought it might not even now be too late to overtake him so set off at once in the direction of merripit house hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of sir henry until came to the point where the moor path branches off there fearing that perhaps had come in the wrong direction after all mounted hill from which could command view the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry thence saw him at once he was on the moor path about quarter of mile off and lady was by his side who could only be miss stapleton it was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by ap pointment they were walking slowly along in deep conversa tion and saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying while he listened intently and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent stood among the rocks watching them very much puzzled as to what should do next to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight to act the spy upon friend was hateful task still could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what had done it is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him was too far away to be of use and yet am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult and that there was nothing more which could do our friend sir henry and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation when was suddenly aware that was not the only witness of their interview wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye and another glance showed me that it was carried on stick by man who was moving among the broken ground it was stapleton with his butterflynet he was very much closer to the pair than was and he appeared to be moving in their direction at this instant sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side his arm was round her but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted he stooped his head to hers and she raised one hand as if in protest next moment saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton was the cause of the interruption he was running wildly towards them his absurd net dangling behind him he gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers what the scene meant could not imagine but it seemed to me that stapleton was abusing sir henry who offered explanations which became more angry as the other refused to accept them the lady stood by in haughty silence finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walked off by the side of her brother the naturalists angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displea sure the baronet stood for minute looking after them and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come his head hanging the very picture of dejection what all this meant could not imagine but was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate scene without my friend knowledge ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom his face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled like one who is at his wit ends what to do halloa watson where have you dropped from said he you do nt mean to say that you came after me in spite of all explained everything to him how had found it impossible to remain behind how had followed him and how had witnessed all that had occurred for an instant his eyes blazed at me but my frankness disarmed his anger and he broke at last into rather rueful laugh you would have thought the middle of that prairie fairly safe place for man to be private said he but by thunder the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing and mighty poor wooing at that where had you engaged seat was on that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother was well up to the front did you see him come out on us yes did did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers ca nt say that he ever did dare say not always thought him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or ought to be in straitjacket what the matter with me anyhow youve lived near me for some weeks watson tell me straight now is there anything that would prevent me from making good husband to woman that loved should say not he ca nt object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he has this down on what has he against me never hurt man or woman in my life that know of and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers did he say so that and deal more tell you watson ve only known her these few weeks but from the first just felt that she was made for me and she too she was happy when she was with me and that ll swear there light in woman eyes that speaks louder than words but he has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time that saw chance of having few words with her alone she was glad to meet me but when she did it was not love that she would talk about and she would nt have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it she kept coming back to it that this was place of danger and that she would never be happy until had left it told her that since had seen her was in no hurry to leave it and that if she really wanted me to go the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me with that offered in as many words to marry her but before she could answer down came this brother of hers running at us with face on him like madman he was just white with rage and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury what was doing with the lady how dared offer her attentions which were distasteful to her did think that because was baronet could do what liked if he had not been her brother should have known better how to answer him as it was told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as was not ashamed of and that hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife that seemed to make the matter no better so then lost my temper too and answered him rather more hotly than should perhaps consider ing that she was standing by so it ended by his going off with her as you saw and here am as badly puzzled man as any in this county just tell me what it all means watson and ll owe you more than ever can hope to pay tried one or two explanations but indeed was completely puzzled myself our friend title his fortune his age his character and his appearance are all in his favour and know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family that his advances should be rejected so brusquely with out any reference to the lady own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing however our conjectures were set at rest by visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning and after long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed and that we are to dine at merripit house next friday as sign of it do nt say now that he is nt crazy man said sir henry ca nt forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning but must allow that no man could make more handsome apology than he has done did he give any explanation of his conduct his sister is everything in his life he says that is natural enough and am glad that he should understand her value they have always been together and according to his account he has been very lonely man with only her as companion so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him he had not understood he said that was becoming attached to her but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so and that she might be taken away from him it gave him such shock that for time he was not responsible for what he said or did he was very sorry for all that had passed and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she had to leave him he had rather it was to neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it was blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady friendship during that time without claiming her love this promised and so the matter rests so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up it is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister suitor even when that suitor was so eligible one as sir henry and now pass on to another thread which have extricated out of the tangled skein the mystery of the sobs in the night of the tearstained face of mrs barrymore of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window congratulate me my dear holmes and tell me that have not disappointed you as an agent that you do not regret the confi dence which you showed in me when you sent me down all these things have by one night work been thoroughly cleared have said by one night work but in truth it was by two nights work for on the first we drew entirely blank sat up with sir henry in his rooms until nearly three oclock in the morning but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs it was most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs fortunately we were not discouraged and we determined to try again the next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander one struck and two and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more we had heard the creak of step in the passage very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness softly we stole along untii we had come into the other wing we were just in time to catch glimpse of the tall blackbearded figure his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage then he passed through the same door as before and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor we shuffled cautiously towards it trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it we had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us but even so the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread some times it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our ap proach however the man is fortunately rather deaf and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing when at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window candle in hand his white intent face pressed against the pane exactly as had seen him two nights before we had arranged no plan of campaign but the baronet is man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural he walked into the room and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with sharp hiss of his breath and stood livid and trembling before us his dark eyes glaring out of the white mask of his face were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me what are you doing here barrymore nothing sir his agitation was so great that he could hardly speak and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle it was the window sir go round at night to see that they are fastened on the second floor yes sir all the windows look here barrymore said sir henry sternly we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later come now no lies what were you doing at that window the fellow looked at us in helpless way and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery was doing no harm sir was holding candle to the window and why were you holding candle to the window do nt ask me sir henry do nt ask me give you my word sir that it is not my secret and that can not tell it if it concerned no one but myself would not try to keep it from you sudden idea occurred to me and took the candle from the trembling hand of the butler he must have been holding it as signal said let us see if there is any answer held it as he had done and stared out into the darkness of the night vaguely could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor for the moon was behind the clouds and then gave cry of exultation for tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window there it is cried no no sir it is nothing nothing at all the butler broke in assure you sir move your light across the window watson cried the baronet see the other moves also now you rascal do you deny that it is signal come speak up who is your confeder ate out yonder and what is this conspiracy that is going on the man face became openly defiant it is my business and not yours will not tell then you leave my employment right away very good sir if must must and you go in disgrace by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself your family has lived with mine for over hundred years under this roof and here find you deep in some dark plot against me no no sir no not against you it was woman voice and mrs barrymore paler and more horrorstruck than her husband was standing at the door her bulky figure in shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face we have to go eliza this is the end of it you can pack our things said the butler oh john john have brought you to this it is my doing sir henry all mine he has done nothing except for my sake and because asked him speak out then what does it mean my unhappy brother is starving on the moor we can not let him perish at our very gates the light is signal to him that food is ready for him and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it then your brother is the escaped convict sir selden the criminal that the truth sir said barrymore said that it was not my secret and that could not tell it to you but now you have heard it and you will see that if there was plot it was not against you this then was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window sir henry and both stared at the woman in amazement was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country yes sir my name was selden and he is my younger brother we humoured him too much when he was lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure and that he could do what he liked in it then as he grew older he met wicked companions and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother heart and dragged our name in the dirt from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold but to me sir he was always the little curlyheaded boy that had nursed and played with as an elder sister would that was why he broke prison sir he knew that was here and that we could not refuse to help him when he dragged himself here one night weary and starving with the warders hard at his heels what could we do we took him in and fed him and cared for him then you returned sir and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over so he lay in hiding there but every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting light in the window and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him every day we hoped that he was gone but as long as he was there we could not desert him that is the whole truth as am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he has done all that he has the woman words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them is this true barrymore yes sir henry every word of it well can not blame you for standing by your own wife forget what have said go to your room you two and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning when they were gone we looked out of the window again sir henry had flung it open and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light wonder he dares said sir henry it may be so placed as to be only visible from here very likely how far do you think it is out by the cleft tor think not more than mile or two off hardly that well it can not be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to it and he is waiting this villain beside that candle by thunder watson am going out to take that man the same thought had crossed my own mind it was not as if the barrymores had taken us into their confidence their secret had been forced from them the man was danger to the community an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was nei ther pity nor excuse we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm with his brutal and violent nature others would have to pay the price if we held our hands any night for example our neighbours the stapletons might be attacked by him and it may have been the thought of this which made sir henry so keen upon the adventure will come said then get your revolver and put on your boots the sooner we start the better as the fellow may put out his light and be off in five minutes we were outside the door starting upon our expedition we hurried through the dark shrubbery amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves the night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay now and again the moon peeped out for an instant but clouds were driving over the face of the sky and just as we came out on the moor thin rain began to fall the light still burned steadily in front are you armed asked have huntingcrop we must close in on him rapidly for he is said to be desperate fellow we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist say watson said the baronet what would holmes say to this how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire it came with the wind through the silence of the night long deep mutter then rising howl and then the sad moan in which it died away again and again it sounded the whole air throbbing with it strident wild and menacing the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness my god what that watson do nt know it sound they have on the moor heard it once before it died away and an absolute silence closed in upon us we stood straining our ears but nothing came watson said the baronet it was the cry of hound my blood ran cold in my veins for there was break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him what do they call this sound he asked who the folk on the countryside oh they are ignorant people why should you mind what they call it tell me watson what do they say of it hesitated but could not escape the question they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles he groaned and was silent for few moments hound it was he said at last but it seemed to come from miles away over yonder think it was hard to say whence it came it rose and fell with the wind is nt that the direction of the great grimpen mire yes it is well it was up there come now watson did nt you think yourself that it was the cry of hound am not child you need not fear to speak the truth stapleton was with me when heard it last he said that it might be the calling of strange bird no no it was hound my god can there be some truth in all these stories is it possible that am really in danger from so dark cause you do nt believe it do you watson no no and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such cry as that and my uncle there was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay it all fits together do nt think that am coward watson but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood feel my hand it was as cold as block of marble you ll be all right tomorrow do nt think ll get that cry out of my head what do you advise that we do now shall we turn back no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it we after the convict and hellhound as likely as not after us come on we ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor we stumbled slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of the craggy hills around us and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front there is nothing so deceptive as the distance of light upon pitchdark night and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within few yards of us but at last we could see whence it came and then we knew that we were indeed very close guttering candle was stuck in crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible save in the direction of baskerville hall boulder of granite concealed our approach and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light it was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor with no sign of life near it just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it what shall we do now whispered sir henry wait here he must be near his light let us see if we can get glimpse of him the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him over the rocks in the crevice of which the candle burned there was thrust out an evil yellow face terrible animal face all seamed and scored with vile passions foul with mire with bristling beard and hung with matted hair it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides the light beneath him was reflected in his small cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters something had evidently aroused his suspicions it may have been that barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well but could read his fears upon his wicked face any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness sprang forward therefore and sir henry did the same at the same moment the convict screamed out curse at us and hurled rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us caught one glimpse of his short squat strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run at the same moment by lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds we rushed over the brow of the hill and there was our man running with great speed down the other side springing over the stones in his way with the activity of mountain goat lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him but had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away we were both swift runners and in fairly good training but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him we saw him for long time in the moonlight until he was only small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of distant hill we ran and ran until we were completely blown but the space between us grew ever wider finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks while we watched him disappearing in the distance and it was at this moment that there occurred most strange and unexpected thing we had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home having abandoned the hopeless chase the moon was low upon the right and the jagged pinnacle of granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc there outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background saw the figure of man upon the tor do not think that it was delusion holmes assure you that have never in my life seen anything more clearly as far as could judge the figure was that of tall thin man he stood with his legs little separated his arms folded his head bowed as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him he might have been the very spirit of that terrible place it was not the convict this man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared besides he was much taller man with cry of surprise pointed him out to the baronet but in the instant during which had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone there was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure wished to go in that direction and to search the tor but it was some distance away the baronet nerves were still quivering from that cry which recalled the dark story of his family and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures he had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me warder no doubl said he the moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped well perhaps his explanation may be the right one but should like to have some further proof of it today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where they should look for their missing man but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner such are the adventures of last night and you must acknowledge my dear holmes that have done you very well in the matter of report much of what tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant but still feel that it is best that should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusilons we are certainly making some prog ress so far as the barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions and that has cleared up the situation very much but the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants re mains as inscrutable as ever perhaps in my next may be able to throw some light upon this also best of all would it be if you could come down to us in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days chapter 10 extract from the diary of dr watson so far have been able to quote from the reports which have forwarded during these early days to sherlock holmes now however have arrived at point in my narrative where am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections aided by the diary which kept at the time few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory proceed then from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor october 16th dull and foggy day with drizzle of rain the house is banked in with rolling clouds which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor with thin silver veins upon the sides of the hills and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces it is melancholy outside and in the baronet is in black reaction after the excitements of the night am conscious myself of weight at my heart and feeling of impending danger ever present dan ger which is the more terrible because am unable to define it and have not cause for such feeling consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us there is the death of the last occupant of the hall fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend and there are the repeated reports from peas ants of the appearance of strange creature upon the moor twice have with my own ears heard the sound which resem bled the distant baying of hound it is incredible impossible that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of stapleton may fall in with such superstition and mortimer also but if have one quality upon earth it is common sense and nothing will persuade me to believe in such thing to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who are not content with mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hellfire shooting from his mouth and eyes holmes would not listen to such fancies and am his agent but facts are facts and have twice heard this crying upon the moor suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it that would go far to explain everything but where could such hound lie concealed where did it get its food where did it come from how was it that no one saw it by day it must be confessed that the natural explana tion offers almost as many difficulties as the other and always apart from the hound there is the fact of the human agency in london the man in the cab and the letter which warned sir henry against the moor this at least was real but it might have been the work of protecting friend as easily as of an enemy where is that friend or enemy now has he remained in london or has he followed us down here could he could he be the stranger whom saw upon the tor it is true that have had only the one glance at him and yet there are some things to which am ready to swear he is no one whom have seen down here and have now met all the neighbours the figure was far taller than that of stapleton far thinner than that of frankland barrymore it might possibly have been but we had left him behind us and am certain that he could not have followed us stranger then is still dogging us just as stranger dogged us in london we have never shaken him off if could lay my hands upon that man then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties to this one purpose must now devote all my energies my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans my second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible ta anyone he is silent and distrait his nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor will say nothing to add to his anxieties but will take my own steps to attain my own end we had small scene this morning after breakfast barrymore asked leave to speak with sir henry and they were closeted in his study some little time sitting in the billiardroom more than once heard the sound of voices raised and had pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion after time the baronet opened his door and called for me barrymore considers that he has grievance he said he thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brotherinlaw down when he of his own free will had told us the secret the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us may have spoken too warmly sir said he and if have am sure that beg your pardon at the same time was very much surprised when heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing selden the poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track if you had told us of your own free will it would have been different thing said the baronet you only told us or rather your wife only told us when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself did nt think you would have taken advantage of it sir henry indeed did nt the man is public danger there are lonely houses scat tered over the moor and he is fellow who would stick at nothing you only want to get glimpse of his face to see that look at mr stapleton house for example with no one but himself to defend it there no safety for anyone untill he is under lock and key he ll break into no house sir give you my solemn word upon that but he will never trouble anyone in this country again assure you sir henry that in very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to south america for god sake sir beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor they have given up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him you ca nt tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble beg you sir to say nothing to the police what do you say watson shrugged my shoulders if he were safely out of the country it would relieve the taxpayer of burden but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes he would not do anything so mad sir we have provided him with all that he can want to commit crime would be to show where he was hiding that is true said sir henry well barrymore god bless you sir and thank you from my heart it would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again guess we are aiding and abetting felony watson but after what we have heard do nt feel as if could give the man up so there is an end of it all right barrymore you can go with few broken words of gratitude the man turned but he hesitated and then came back you ve been so kind to us sir that should like to do the best can for you in return know something sir henry and perhaps should have said it before but it was long after the inquest that found it out ve never breathed word about it yet to mortal man it about poor sir charles death the baronet and were both upon our feet do you know how he died no sir do nt know that what then know why he was at the gate at that hour it was to meet woman to meet woman he yes sir and the woman name ca nt give you the name sir but can give you the initials her initials were how do you know this barrymore well sir henry your uncle had letter that morning he had usually great many letters for he was public man and well known for his kind heart so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him but that morning as it chanced there was only this one letter so took the more notice of it it was from coombe tracey and it was addressed in womans hand well well sir thought no more of the matter and never would have done had it not been for my wife only few weeks ago she was cleaning out sir charles study it had never been touched since his death and she found the ashes of burned letter in the back of the grate the greater part of it was charred to pieces but one little slip the end of page hung together and the writing could still be read though it was gray on black ground it seemed to us to be postscript at the end of the letter and it said please please as you are gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten clock beneath it were signed the initials have you got that slip no sir it crumbled all to bits after we moved it had sir charles received any other lettefs in the same writting well sir took no particular notice of his letters should not have noticed this one only it happened to come alone and you have no idea who is no sir no more than you have but expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charless death can not understand barrymore how you came to conceal this important information well sir it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us and then again sir we were both of us very fond of sir charles as we well might be considering all that he has done for us to rake this up could nt help our poor master and it well to go carefully when there lady in the case even the best of us you thought it might injure his reputation well sir thought no good could come of it but now you have been kind to us and feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that know about the matter very good barrymore you can go when the butler had left us sir henry turned to me well watson what do you think of this new light it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before so think but if we can only trace it should clear up the whole business we have gained that much we know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her what do you think we should do let holmes know all about it at once it will give him the clue for which he has been seeking am much mistaken if it does not bring him down went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning conversation for holmes it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late for the notes which had from baker street were few and short with no comments upon the informa tion which had supplied and hardly any reference to my mis sion no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest wish that he were here october 17th all day today the rain poured down rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves thought of the convict out upon the bleak cold shelterless moor poor devil whatever his crimes he has suffered something to atone for them and then thought of that other one the face in the cab the figure against the moon was he also out in that deluged the unseen watcher the man of darkness in the evening put on my waterproof and walked far upon the sodden moor full of dark imaginings the rain beating upon my face and the wind whis tling about my ears god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm uplands are becoming morass found the black tor upon which had seen the solitary watcher and from its craggy summit looked out myself across the melancholy downs rain squalls drifted across their russet face and the heavy slatecoloured clouds hung low over the land scape trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills in the distant hollow on the left half hidden by the mist the two thin towers of baskerville hall rose above the trees they were the only signs of human life which could see save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom had seen on the same spot two nights before as walked back was overtaken by dr mortimer driving in his dogcart over rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of foulmire he has been very attentive to us and hardly day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on he insisted upon my climbing into his dogcart and he gave me lift homeward found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel it had wandered on to the moor and had never come back gave him such consolation as might but thought of the pony on the grimpen mire and do not fancy that he will see his little dog again by the way mortimer said as we jolted along the rough road suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know hardly any think can you then tell me the name of any woman whose initials are he thought for few minutes no said he there are few gipsies and labouring folk for whom ca nt answer but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those wait bit though he added after pause there is laura lyons her initials are but she lives in coombe tracey who is she asked she is frankland daughter what old frankland the crank exactly she married an artist named lyons who came sketching on the moor he proved to be blackguard and deserted her the fault from what hear may not have been entirely on one side her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and per haps for one or two other reasons as well so between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had pretty bad time how does she live fancy old frankland allows her pittance but it can not be more for his own affairs are considerably involved whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad her story got about and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living stapleton did for one and sir charles for another gave trifle myself it was to set her up in typewriting business he wanted to know the object of my inquiries but managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence tomorrow morning shall find my way to coombe tracey and if can see this mrs laura lyons of equivocal reputation long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent for when mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent asked him casually to what type frank land skull belonged and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day this was my conversation with barrymore just now which gives me one more strong card which can play in due time mortimer had stayed to dinner and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards the butler brought me my coffee into the library and took the chance to ask him few questions well said has this precious relation of yours departed or is he still lurking out yonder do nt know sir hope to heaven that he has gone for he has brought nothing but trouble here ve not heard of him since left out food for him last and that was three days ago did you see him then no sir but the food was gone when next went that way then he was certainly there so you would think sir unless it was the other man who took it sat with my coffeecup halfway to my lips and stared at barrymore you know that there is another man then yes sir there is another man upon the moor have you seen him no sir how do you know of him then selden told me of him sir week ago or more he in hiding too but he not convict as far as can make out do nt like it dr watson tell you straight sir that do nt like it he spoke with sudden passion of earnestness now listen to me barrymore have no interest in this matter but that of your master have come here with no object except to help him tell me frankly what it is that you dont like barrymore hesitated for moment as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words it all these goingson sir he cried at last waving his hand towards the rainlashed window which faced the moor there foul play somewhere and there black villainy brew ing to that ll swear very glad should be sir to see sir henry on his way back to london again but what is it that alarms you look at sir charles death that was bad enough for all that the coroner said look at the noises on the moor at night there not man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it look at this stranger hiding out yonder and watching and waiting what he waiting for what does it mean it means no good to anyone of the name of baskerville and very glad shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry new servants are ready to take over the hall but about this stranger said can you tell me anything about him what did selden say did he find out where he hid or what he was doing he saw him once or twice but he is deep one and gives nothing away at first he thought that he was the police but soon he found that he had some lay of his own kind of gentleman he was as far as he could see but what he was doing he could not make out and where did he say that he lived among the old houses on the hillside the stone huts where the old folk used to live but how about his food selden found out that he has got lad who works for him and brings all he needs dare say he goes to coombe tracey for what he wants very good barrymore we may talk further of this some other time when the butler had gone walked over to the black window and looked through blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the windswept trees it is wild night indoors and what must it be in stone hut upon the moor what passion of hatred can it be which leads man to lurk in such place at such time and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such trial there in that hut upon the moor seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely swear that another day shall not have passed before have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery chapter 11 the man on the tor the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion the incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection and can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time start them from the day which succeeded that upon which had established two facts of great importance the one that mrs laura lyons of coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside with these two facts in my possession felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if could not throw some further light upon these dark places had no opportunity to tell the baronet what had learned about mrs lyons upon the evening before for dr mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late at breakfast however informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to coombe tracey at first he was very eager to come but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if went alone the results might be better the more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain left sir henry behind therefore not without some prickings of conscience and drove off upon my new quest when reached coombe tracey told perkins to put up the horses and made inquiries for the lady whom had come to interrogate had no difficulty in finding her rooms which were central and well appointed maid showed me in without cere mony and as entered the sittingroom lady who was sitting before remington typewriter sprang up with pleasant smile of welcome her face fell however when she saw that was stranger and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit the first impression left by mrs lyons was one of extreme beauty her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour and her cheeks though considerably freckled were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose admiration was repeat the first impression but the second was criticism there was some thing subtly wrong with the face some coarseness of expres sion some hardness perhaps of eye some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty but these of course are after thoughts at the moment was simply conscious that was in the presence of very handsome woman and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was have the pleasure said of knowing your father it was clumsy introduction and the lady made me feel it there is nothing in common between my father and me she said owe him nothing and his friends are not mine if it were not for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts might have starved for all that my father cared it was about the late sir charles baskerville that have come here to see you the freckles started out on the lady face what can tell you about him she asked and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter you knew him did you not have already said that owe great deal to his kindness if am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation did you correspond with him the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes what is the object of these questions she asked sharply the object is to avoid public scandal it is better that should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control she was silent and her face was still very pale at last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner well ll answer she said what are your questions did you correspond with sir charles certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity have you the dates of those letters no have you ever met him yes once or twice when he came into coombe tracey he was very retiring man and he preferred to do good by stealth but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you as you say that he has done she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me one was mr stapleton neighbour and intimate friend of sir charles he was exceedingly kind and it was through him that sir charles learned about my affairs knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton his almoner upon several occasions so the lady statement bore the impress of truth upon it did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you continued mrs lyons flushed with anger again really sir this is very extraordinary question am sorry madam but must repeat it then answer certainly not not on the very day of sir charles death the flush had faded in an instant and deathly face was before me her dry lips could not speak the no which saw rather than heard surely your memory deceives you said could even quote passage of your letter it ran please please as you are gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten oclock thought that she had fainted but she recovered herself by supreme effort is there no such thing as gentleman she gasped you do sir charles an injustice he did burn the letter but sometimes letter may be legible even when burned you acknowledge now that you wrote it yes did write it she cried pouring out her soul in torrent of words did write it why should deny it have no reason to be ashamed of it wished him to help me believed that if had an interview could gain his help so asked him to meet me but why at such an hour because had only just learned that he was going to london next day and might be away for months there were reasons why could not get there earlier but why rendezvous in the garden instead of visit to the house do you think woman could go alone at that hour to bachelor house well what happened when you did get there never went mrs lyons no swear it to you on all hold sacred never went something intervened to prevent my going what was that that is private matter can not tell it you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death but you deny that you kept the appointment that is the truth again and again crossquestioned her but could never get past that point mrs lyons said as rose from this long and inconclu sive interview you are taking very great responsibility and putting yourself in very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know if have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compro mised if your position is innocent why did you in the first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that date because feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that might find myself involved in scandal and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy your letter if you have read the letter you will know did not say that had read all the letter you quoted some of it quoted the postscript the letter had as said been burned and it was not all legible ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death the matter is very private one the more reason why you should avoid public investigation will tell you then if you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that made rash marriage and had reason to regret it have heard so much my life has been one incessant persecution from husband whom abhor the law is upon his side and every day am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him at the time that wrote this letter to sir charles had learned that there was prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met it meant everything to me peace of mind happiness selfrespect everything knew sir charless generosity and thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me then how is it that you did not go because received help in the interval from another source why then did you not write to sir charles and explain this so should have done had not seen his death in the paper next morning the woman story hung coherently together and all my questions were unable to shake it could only check it by finding if she had indeed instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to baskerville hall if she really had been for trap would be necessary to take her there and could not have returned to coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning such an excursion could not be kept secret the probability was there fore that she was telling the truth or at least part of the truth came away baffled and disheartened once again had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which tried to get at the object of my mission and yet the more thought of the lady face and of her manner the more felt that something was being held back from me why should she turn so pale why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe for the moment could proceed no farther in that direction but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor and that was most vague direction realized it as drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people barrymore only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor but had my own experience for guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the black tor that then should be the centre of my search from there should explore every hut upon the moor until lighted upon the right one if this man were inside it should find out from his own lips at the point of my revolver if necessary who he was and why he had dogged us so long he might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor on the other hand if should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it must remain there however long the vigil until he returned holmes had missed him in london it would indeed be triumph for me if could run him to earth where my master had failed luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry but now at last it came to my aid and the messenger of good fortune was none other than mr frankland who was standing graywhiskered and redfaced outside the gate of bis garden which opened on to the highroad along which travelled goodday dr watson cried he with unwonted good humour you must really give your horses rest and come in to have glass of wine and to congratulate me my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what had heard of his treatment of his daughter but was anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home and the oppor tunity was good one alighted and sent message to sir henry that should walk over in time for dinner then fol lowed frankland into his diningroom it is great day for me sir one of the redletter days of my life he cried with many chuckles have brought off double event mean to teach them in these parts that law is law and that there is man here who does not fear to invoke it have established right of way through the centre of old middletons park slap across it sir within hundred yards of his own front door what do you think of that we ll teach these magnates that they can not ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners confound them and ve closed the wood where the fernworthy folk used to picnic these infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles both cases decided dr watson and both in my favour have nt had such day since had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren how on earth did you do that look it up in the books sir it will repay reading frankland morland court of queen bench it cost me 200 pounds but got my verdict did it do you any good none sir none am proud to say that had no interest in the matter act entirely from sense of public duty have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions the county constabu lary is in scandalous state sir and it has not afforded me the protection to which am entitled the case of frankland regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me and already my words have come true how so asked the oid man put on very knowing expression because could tell them what they are dying to know but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way had been casting round for some excuse by which could get away from his gossip but now began to wish to hear more of it had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences some poaching case no doubt said with an indifferent manner ha ha my boy very much more important matter than that what about the convict on the moor stared you do nt mean that you know where he is said may not know exactly where he is but am quite sure that could help the police to lay their hands on him has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth no doubt said but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor know it because have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food my heart sank for barrymore it was serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody but his next remark took weight from my mind you ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by child see him every day through my telescope upon the roof he passes along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be going except to the convict here was luck indeed and yet suppressed all appearance of interest child barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by boy it was on his track and not upon the convict that frankland had stumbled if could get his knowl edge it might save me long and weary hunt but incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father dinner the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat his eyes looked malignantly at me and his gray whis kers bristled like those of an angry cat indeed sir said he pointing out over the widestretching moor do you see that black tor over yonder well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it it is the stoniest part of the whole moor is that place where shepherd would be likely to take his station your suggestion sir is most absurd one meekly answered that had spoken without knowing all the facts my submission pleased him and led him to further confidences you may be sure sir that have very good grounds before come to an opinion have seen the boy again and again with his bundle every day and sometimes twice day have been able but wait moment dr watson do my eyes deceive me or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside it was several miles off but could distinctly see small dark dot against the dull green and gray come sir come cried frankland rushing upstairs you will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself the telescope formidable instrument mounted upon tri pod stood upon the flat leads of the house frankland clapped his eye to it and gave cry of satisfaction quick dr watson quick before he passes over the hill there he was sure enough small urchin with little bundle upon his shoulder toiling slowly up the hill when he reached the crest saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky he looked round him with furtive and stealthy air as one who dreads pursuit then he vanished over the hill well am right certainly there is boy who seems to have some secret errand and what the errand is even county constable could guess but not one word shall they have from me and bind you to secrecy also dr watson not word you understand just as you wish they have treated me shamefully shamefully when the facts come out in frankland regina venture to think that thrill of indignation will run through the country nothing would induce me to help the police in any way for all they cared it might have been me instead of my effigy which these rascals burned at the stake surely you are not going you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion but resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me kept the road as long as his eye was on me and then struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared everything was working in my favour and swore that it should not be through lack of energy or persever ance that should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way the sun was already sinking when reached the summit of the hill and the long slopes beneath me were all goldengreen on one side and gray shadow on the other haze lay low upon the farthest skyline out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of belliver and vixen tor over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement one great gray bird gull or curlew soared aloft in the blue heaven he and seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck chill into my heart the boy was nowhere to be seen but down beneath me in cleft of the hills there was circle of the old stone huts and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as screen against the weather my heart leaped within me as saw it this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked at last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place his secret was within my grasp as approached the hut walking as warily as stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as habita tion vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as door all was silent within the unknown might be lurking there or he might be prowling on the moor my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure throwing aside my cigarette closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and walking swiftly up to the door looked in the place was empty but there were ample signs that had not come upon false scent this was certainly where the man lived some blankets rolled in waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered the ashes of fire were heaped in rude grate beside it lay some cooking utensils and bucket halffull of water litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time and saw as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light pannikin and halffull bottle of spirits standing in the corner in the middle of the hut flat stone served the purpose of table and upon this stood small cloth bundle the same no doubt which had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy it contained loaf of bread tinned tongue and two tins of preserved peaches as set it down again after having examined it my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay sheet of paper with writing upon it raised it and this was what read roughly scrawled in pencil dr watson has gone to coombe tracey for minute stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message it was then and not sir henry who was being aogged by this secret man he had not followed me himself but he had set an agent the boy perhaps upon my track and this was his report possibly had taken no step since had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported always there was this feeling of an unseen force fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeedentangled in its meshes if there was one report there might be others so looked round the hut in search of them there was no trace however of anything of the kind nor could discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place save that he must be of spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life when thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode was he our malignant enemy or was he by chance our guardian angel swore that would not leave the hut until knew outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire there were the two towers of baskerville hall and there distant blur of smoke which marked the village of grimpen between the two behind the hill was the house of the stapletons all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light and yet as looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer with tingling nerves but fixed purpose sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant and then at last heard him far away came the sharp clink of boot striking upon stone then another and yet another coming nearer and nearer shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket determined not to discover myself until had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger there was long pause which showed that he had stopped then once more the footsteps approached and shadow fell across the opening of the hut it is lovely evening my dear watson said wellknown voice really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in chapter 12 death on the moor for moment or two sat breathless hardly able to believe my ears then my senses and my voice came back to me while crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul that cold incisive ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world holmes cried holmes come out said he and please be careful with the revolver stooped under the rude lintel and there he sat upon stone outside his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features he was thin and worn but clear and alert his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor and he had contrived with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in baker street never was more glad to see anyone in my life said as wrung him by the hand or more astonished eh well must confess to it the surprise was not all on one side assure you had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat still less that you were inside it until was within twenty paces of the door my footprint presume no watson fear that could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world if you seri ously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist for when see the stub of cigarette marked bradley oxford street know that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood you will see it there beside the path you threw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut exactly thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity was convinced that you were sitting in ambush weapon within reach waiting for the tenant to return so you actually thought that was the criminal did not know who you were but was determined to find out excellent watson and how did you localize me you saw me perhaps on the night of the convict hunt when was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me yes saw you then and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one no your boy had been observed and that gave me guide where to look the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt could not make it out when first saw the light flashing upon the lens he rose and peeped into the hut ha see that cartwright has brought up some supplies what this paper so you have been to coombe tracey have you yes to see mrs laura lyons exactly well done our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines and when we unite our results expect we shall have fairly full knowledge of the case well am glad from my heart that you are here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves but how in the name of wonder did you come here and what have you been doing thought that you were in baker street working out that case of blackmailing that was what wished you to think then you use me and yet do not trust me cried with some bitterness think that have deserved better at your hands holmes my dear fellow you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases and beg that you will forgive me if have seemed to play trick upon you in truth it was partly for your own sake that did it and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself had been with sir henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard as it is have been able to get about as could not possibly have done had been living in the hall and remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at critical moment but why keep me in the dark for you to know could not have helped us and might possi bly have led to my discovery you would have wished to tell me something or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run brought cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the express office and he has seen after my simple wants loaf of bread and clean collar what does man want more he has given me an extra pair of eyes upon very active pair of feet and both have been invaluable then my reports have all been wasted my voice trem bled as recalled the pains and the pride with which had composed them holmes took bundle of papers from his pocket here are your reports my dear fellow and very well thumbed assure you made excellent arrangements and they are only delayed one day upon their way must compliment you ex ceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me but the warmth of holmes praise drove my anger from my mind felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that should not have known that he was upon the moor that better said he seeing the shadow rise from my face and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs laura lyons it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone for am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter in fact if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that should have gone tomorrow the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor the air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth there sitting together in the twilight told holmes of my conversation with the lady so interested was he that had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied this is most important said he when had concluded it fills up gap which had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair you are aware perhaps that close intimacy exists between this lady and the man stapleton did not know of close intimacy there can be no doubt about the matter they meet they write there is complete understanding between them now this puts very powerful weapon into our hands if could only use it to detach his wife his wife am giving you some information now in return for all that you have given me the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is in reality his wife good heavens holmes are you sure of what you say how could he have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her sir henry falling in love could do no harm to anyone except sir henry he took particular care that sir henry did not make love to her as you have yourself observed repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister but why this elaborate deception because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of free woman all my unspoken instincts my vague suspicions suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist in that impassive colourless man with his straw hat and his butterflynet seemed to see something terrible creature of infinite patience and craft with smiling face and murderous heart it is he then who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in london so read the riddle and the warning it must have come from her exactly the shape of some monstrous villainy half seen half guessed loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long but are you sure of this holmes how do you know that the woman is his wife because he so far forgot himself as to tell you true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you and dare say he has many time regretted it since he was once schoolmaster in the north of england now there is no one more easy to trace than schoolmaster there are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession little investigation showed me that school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances and that the man who had owned it the name was different had disappeared with his wife the descriptions agreed when learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete the darkness was rising but much was still hidden by the shadows if this woman is in truth his wife where does mrs laura lyons come in asked that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed light your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much did not know about projected divorce between herself and her husband in that case regarding stapleton as an unmarried man she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife and when she is undeceived why then we may find the lady of service it must be our first duty to see her both of us tomorrow do nt you think watson that you are away from your charge rather long your place should be at baskerville hall the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor few faint stars were gleaming in violet sky one last question holmes said as rose surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me what is the meaning of it all what is he after holmes voice sank as he answered it is murder watson refined coldblooded deliberate mur der do not ask me for particulars my nets are closing upon him even as his are upon sir henry and with your help he is already almost at my mercy there is but one danger which can threaten us it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so another day two at the most and have my case com plete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever fond mother watched her ailing child your mission today has justi fied itself and yet could almost wish that you had not left his side hark terrible scream prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor that frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins oh my god gasped what is it what does it mean holmes had sprung to his feet and saw his dark athletic outline at the door of the hut his shoulders stooping his head thrust forward his face peering into the darkness hush he whispered hush the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain now it burst upon our ears nearer louder more urgent than before where is it holmes whispered and knew from the thrill of his voice that he the man of iron was shaken to the soul where is it watson there think pointed into the darkness no there again the agonized cry swept through the silent night louder and much nearer than ever and new sound mingled with it deep muttered rumble musical and yet menacing rising and falling like the low constant murmur of the sea the hound cried holmes come watson come great heavens if we are too late he had started running swiftly over the moor and had followed at his heels but now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell and then dull heavy thud we halted and listened not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like man dis tracted he stamped his feet upon the ground he has beaten us watson we are too late no no surely not fool that was to hold my hand and you watson see what comes of abandoning your charge but by heaven if the worst has happened we ll avenge him blindly we ran through the gloom blundering against boul ders forcing our way through gorse bushes panting up hills and rushing down slopes heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come at every rise holmes looked eagerly round him but the shadows were thick upon the moor and nothing moved upon its dreary face can you see anything nothing but hark what is that low moan had fallen upon our ears there it was again upon our left on that side ridge of rocks ended in sheer cliff which overlooked stonestrewn slope on its jagged face was spreadeagled some dark irregular object as we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into definite shape it was pros trate man face downward upon the ground the head doubled under him at horrible angle the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing somersault so grotesque was the attitude that could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul not whisper not rustle rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim and it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us the body of sir henry baskerville there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in baker street we caught the one clear glimpse of it and then the match flickered and went out even as the hope had gone out of our souls holmes groaned and his face glimmered white through the darkness the brute the brute cried with clenched hands oh holmes shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate am more to blame than you watson in order to have my case well rounded and complete have thrown away the life of my client it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career but how could know how could know that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings that we should have heard his screams my god those screams and yet have been unable to save him where is this brute of hound which drove him to his death it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant and stapleton where is he he shall answer for this deed he shall will see to that uncle and nephew have been murdered the one frightened to death by the very sight of beast which he thought to be supernatural the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast save from what we heard we can not even swear to the existence of the latter since sir henry has evidently died from the fall but by heavens cunning as he is the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past we stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor half silver and half gloom far away miles off in the direction of grimpen single steady yellow light was shining it could only come from the lonely abode of the stapletons with bitter curse shook my fist at it as gazed why should we not seize him at once our case is not complete the fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree it is not what we know but what we can prove if we make one false move the villain may escape us yet what can we do there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body black and clear against the silvered stones the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears we must send for help holmes we can not carry him all the way to the hall good heavens are you mad he had uttered cry and bent over the body now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand could this be my stern selfcontained friend these were hidden fires indeed beard beard the man has beard beard it is not the baronet it is why it is my neighbour the convict with feverish haste we had turned the body over and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold clear moon there could be no doubt about the beetling forehead the sunken animal eyes it was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden the criminal then in an instant it was all clear to me remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to barrymore barrymore had passed it on in order to help selden in his escape boots shirt cap it was all sir henry the tragedy was still black enough but this man had at least de served death by the laws of his country told holmes how the matter stood my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy then the clothes have been the poor devil death said he it is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of sir henry the boot which was abstracted in the hotel in all probability and so ran this man down there is one very singular thing however how came selden in the dark ness to know that the hound was on his trail he heard him to hear hound upon the moor would not work hard man like this convict into such paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help by his cries he must have run long way after he knew the animal was on his track how did he know greater mystery to me is why this hound presuming that all our conjectures are correct presume nothing well then why this hound should be loose tonight suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would be there my difficulty is the more formidable of the two for think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain forever mystery the question now is what shall we do with this poor wretch body we can not leave it here to the foxes and the ravens suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police exactly have no doubt that you and could carry it so far halloa watson what this it the man himself by all thats wonderful and audacious not word to show yow suspicions not word or my plans crumble to the ground figure was approaching us over the moor and saw the dull red glow of cigar the moon shone upon him and could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist he stopped when he saw us and then came on again why dr watson that not you is it you are the last man that should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night but dear me what this somebody hurt not dont tell me that it is our friend sir henry he hurried past me and stooped over the dead man heard sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers who who this he stammered it is selden the man who escaped from princetown stapleton turned ghastly face upon us but by supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment he looked sharply from holmes to me dear me what very shocking affair how did he die he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks my friend and were strolling on the moor when we heard cry heard cry also that was what brought me out was uneasy about sir henry why about sir henry in particular could not help asking because had suggested that he should come over when he did not come was surprised and naturally became alarmed for his safety when heard cries upon the moor by the way his eyes darted again from my face to holmes did you hear anything else besides cry no said holmes did you no what do you mean then oh you know the stories that the peasants tell about phantom hound and so on it is said to be heard at night upon the moor was wondering if there were any evidence of such sound tonight we heard nothing of the kind said and what is your theory of this poor fellow death have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head he has rushed about the moor in crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck that seems the most reasonable theory said stapleton and he gave sigh which took to indicate his relief what do you think about it mr sherlock holmes my friend bowed his compliments you are quick at identification said he we have been expecting you in these parts since dr watson came down you are in time to see tragedy yes indeed have no doubt that my friend explanation will cover the facts will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me tomorrow oh you return tomorrow that is my intention hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us holmes shrugged his shoulders one can not always have the success for which one hopes an investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours it has not been satisfactory case my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned man ner stapleton still looked hard at him then he turned to me would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house but it would give my sister such fright that do not feel justified in doing it think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning and so it was arranged resisting stapleton offer of hospi tality holmes and set off to baskerville hall leaving the naturalist to return alone looking back we saw the figure mov ing slowly away over the broad moor and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end chapter 13 fixing the nets we re at close grips at last said holmes as we walked together across the moor what nerve the fellow has how he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen victim to his plot told you in london watson and tell you now again that we have never had foeman more worthy of our steel am sorry that he has seen you and so was at first but there was no getting out of it what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here it may cause him to be more cautious or it may drive him to desperate measures at once like most clever criminals he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us why should we not arrest him at once my dear watson you were born to be man of action your instinct is always to do something energetic but supposing for argument sake that we had him arrested tonight what on earth the better off should we be for that we could prove nothing against him there the devilish cunning of it if he were acting through human agent we could get some evidence but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting rope round the neck of its master surely we have case not shadow of one only surmise and conjecture we should be laughed out of court if we came with such story and such evidence there is sir charles death found dead without mark upon him you and know that he died of sheer fright and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it what signs are there of hound where are the marks of its fangs of course we know that hound does not bite dead body and that sir charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him but we have to prove all this and we are not in position to do it well then tonight we are not much better off tonight again there was no direct connection between the hound and the man death we never saw the hound we heard it but we could not prove that it was running upon this man trail there is complete absence of motive no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one and how do you propose to do so have great hopes of what mrs laura lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her and have my own plan as well sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof but hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last could draw nothing further from him and he walked lost in thought as far as the baskerville gates are you coming up yes see no reason for further concealment but one last word watson say nothing of the hound to sir henry let him think that selden death was as stapleton would have us be lieve he will have better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he is engaged if remember your report aright to dine with these people and so am then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone that will be easily arranged and now if we are too late for dinner think that we are both ready for our suppers sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from london he did raise his eyebrows however when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence between us we soon supplied his wants and then over belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know but first had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to barrymore and his wife to him it may have been an unmitigated relief but she wept bitterly in her apron to all the world he was the man of violence half animal and half demon but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood the child who had clung to her hand evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him ve been moping in the house all day since watson went off in the morning said the baronet guess should have some credit for have kept my promise if had nt sworn not to go about alone might have had more lively evening for had message from stapleton asking me over there have no doubt that you would have had more lively evening said holmes drily by the way do nt suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck sir henry opened his eyes how was that this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police that is unlikely there was no mark on any of them as far as know that lucky for him in fact it lucky for all of you since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter am not sure that as conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household watson reports are most incriminating documents but how about the case asked the baronet have you made anything out of the tangle do nt know that watson and are much the wiser since we came down think that shall be in position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long it has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business there are several points upon which we still want light but it is coming all the same we ve had one experience as watson has no doubt told you we heard the hound on the moor so can swear that it is not all empty superstition had something to do with dogs when was out west and know one when hear one if you can muzzle that one and put him on chain ll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time think will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help whatever you tell me to do will do very good and will ask you also to do it blindly without always asking the reason just as you like if you will do this think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved have no doubt he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air the lamp beat upon his face and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of clearcut classical statue personification of alertness and expectation what is it we both cried could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion his features were still composed but his eyes shone with amused exultation excuse the admiration of connoisseur said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall watson wo nt allow that know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ now these are really very fine series of portraits well glad to hear you say so said sir henry glancing with some surprise at my friend do nt pretend to know much about these things and be better judge of horse or steer than of picture did nt know that you found time for such things know what is good when see it and see it now that kneller ll swear that lady in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be reynolds they are all family portraits presume every one do you know the names barrymore has been coaching me in them and think can say my lessons fairly well who is the gentleman with the telescope that is rearadmiral baskerville who served under rodney in the west indies the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is sir william baskerville who was chairman of commit tees of the house of commons under pitt and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet and the lace ah you have right to know about him that is the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who started the hound of the baskervilles we re not likely to forget him gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait dear me said holmes he seems quiet meekmannered man enough but dare say that there was lurking devil in his eyes had pictured him as more robust and ruffianly person there no doubt about the authenticity for the name and the date 1647 are on the back of the canvas holmes said little more but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have fascination for him and his eyes were continu ally fixed upon it during supper it was not until later when sir henry had gone to his room that was able to follow the trend of his thoughts he led me back into the banquetinghall his bedroom candle in his hand and he held it up against the timestained portrait on the wall do you see anything there looked at the broad plumed hat the curling lovelocks the white lace collar and the straight severe face which was framed between them lt was not brutal countenance but it was prim hard and stern with firmset thinlipped mouth and coldly intolerant eye is it like anyone you know there is something of sir henry about the jaw just suggestion perhaps but wait an instant he stood upon chair and holding up the light in his left hand he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets good heavens cried in amazement the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas ha you see it now my eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings it is the first quality of criminal investigator that he should see through disguise but this is marvellous it might be his portrait yes it is an interesting instance of throwback which appears to be both physical and spiritual study of family portraits is enough to convert man to the doctrine of reincarna tion the fellow is baskerville that is evident with designs upon the succession exactly this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links we have him watson we have him and dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies pin cork and card and we add him to the baker street collection he burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture have not heard him laugh often and it has always boded ill to somebody was up betimes in the morning but holmes was afoot earlier still for saw him as dressed coming up the drive yes we should have full day today he remarked and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action the nets are all in place and the drag is about to begin we ll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big leanjawed pike or whether he has got through the meshes have you been on the moor already have sent report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden think can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter and have also communicated with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut as dog does at his master grave if had not set his mind at rest about my safety what is the next move to see sir henry ah here he is goodmorning holmes said the baronet you look like general who is planning battle with his chief of the staff that is the exact situation watson was asking for orders and so do very good you are engaged as understand to dine with our friends the stapletons tonight hope that you will come also they are very hospitable people and am sure that they would be very glad to see you fear that watson and must go to london to london yes think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture the baronet face perceptibly lengthened hoped that you were going to see me through this business the hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone my dear fellow you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what tell you you can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you but that urgent business required us to be in town we hope very soon to return to devonshire will you remember to give them that message if you insist upon it there is no alternative assure you saw by the baronet clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion when do you desire to go he asked coldly immediately after breakfast we will drive in to coombe tracey but watson will leave his things as pledge that he will come back to you watson you will send note to stapleton to tell him that you regret that you can not come have good mind to go to london with you said the baronet why should stay here alone because it is your post of duty because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told and tell you to stay all right then ll stay one more direction wish you to drive to merripit house send back your trap however and let them know that you intend to walk home to walk across the moor yes but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do this time you may do it with safety if had not every confidence in your nerve and courage would not suggest it but it is essential that you should do it then will do it and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit house to the grimpen road and is your natural way home will do just what you say very good should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon was much astounded by this programme though remem bered that holmes had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day it had not crossed my mind however that he would wish me to go with him nor could understand how we could both be absent at moment which he himself declared to be critical there was nothing for it how ever but implicit obedience so we bade goodbye to our rueful friend and couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of coombe tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey small boy was waiting upon the platform any orders sir you will take this train to town cartwright the moment you arrive you will send wire to sir henry baskerville in my name to say that if he finds the pocketbook which have dropped he is to send it by registered post to baker street yes sir and ask at the station office if there is message for me the boy returned with telegram which holmes handed to me it ran wire received coming down with unsigned warrant arrive fiveforty lestrade that is in answer to mine of this morning he is the best of the professionals think and we may need his assistance now watson think that we can not employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance mrs laura lyons his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed that telegram from london if mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons must remove the last suspicions from their minds already seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike mrs laura lyons was in her office and sherlock holmes opened his interview with frankness and directness which considerably amazed her am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late sir charles baskerville said he my friend here dr watson has informed me of what you have communi cated and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter what have withheld she asked defiantly you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten oclock we know that that was the place and hour of his death you have withheld what the connection is between these events there is no connection in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one but think that we shall succeed in establishing connec tion after all wish to be perfectly frank with you mrs lyons we regard this case as one of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your friend mr stapleton but his wife as well the lady sprang from her chair his wife she cried the fact is no longer secret the person who has passed for his sister is really his wife mrs lyons had resumed her seat her hands were grasping the arms of her chair and saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip his wife she said again his wife he is not married man sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders prove it to me prove it to me and if you can do so the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words have come prepared to do so said holmes drawing several papers from his pocket here is photograph of the couple taken in york four years ago it is indorsed mr and mrs vandeleur but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him and her also if you know her by sight here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of mr and mrs vandeleur who at that time kept st oliver private school read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people she glanced at them and then looked up at us with the set rigid face of desperate woman mr holmes she said this man had offered me marriage on condition that could get divorce from my husband he has lied to me the villain in every conceivable way not one word of truth has he ever told me and why why imagined that all was for my own sake but now see that was never anything but tool in his hands why should preserve faith with him who never kept any with me why should try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts ask me what you like and there is nothing which shall hold back one thing swear to you and that is that when wrote the letter never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman who had been my kindest friend entirely believe you madam said sherlock holmes the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if tell you what occurred and you can check me if make any material mistake the sending of this letter was suggested to you by stapleton he dictated it presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce exactly and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment he told me that it would hurt his selfrespect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he was poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us he appears to be very consistent character and then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper no and he made you swear to say nothing about your appoint ment with sir charles he did he said that the death was very mysterious one and that should certainly be suspected if the facts came out he frightened me into remaining silent quite so but you had your suspicions she hesitated and looked down knew him she said but if he had kept faith with me should always have done so with him think that on the whole you have had fortunate escape said sherlock holmes you have had him in your power and he knew it and yet you are alive you have been walking for some months very near to the edge of precipice we must wish you goodmorning now mrs lyons and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again our case becomes rounded off and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us said holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town shall soon be in the position of being able to put into single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in godno in little russia in the year 66 and of course there are the anderson murders in north carolina but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own even now we have no clear case against this very wily man but shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night the london express came roaring into the station and small wiry bulldog of man had sprung from firstclass carriage we all three shook hands and saw at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned good deal since the days when they had first worked together could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man anything good he asked the biggest thing for years said holmes we have two hours before we need think of starting think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by giving you breath of the pure night air of dartmoor never been there ah well dont suppose you will forget your first visit chapter 14 the hound of the baskervilles one of sherlock holmes defects if indeed one may call it defect was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him partly also from his professional caution which urged him never to take any chances the result however was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants had often suffered under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness the great ordeal was in front of us at last we were about to make our final effort and yet holmes had said nothing and could only surmise what his course of action would be my nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipa tion it was relief to me after that unnatural restraint when we at last passed frankland house and knew that we were drawing near to the hall and to the scene of action we did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue the wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to coombe tracey forthwith while we started to walk to merripit house are you armed lestrade the little detective smiled as long as have my trousers have hippocket and as long as have my hippocket have something in it good my friend and are also ready for emergencies you re mighty close about this affair mr holmes whats the game now waiting game my word it does not seem very cheerful place said the detective with shiver glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the grimpen mire see the lights of house ahead of us that is merripit house and the end of our journey must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above whisper we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it this will do said he these rocks upon the right make an admirable screen we are to wait here yes we shall make our little ambush here get into this hollow lestrade you have been inside the house have you not watson can you tell the position of the rooms what are those latticed windows at this end think they are the kitchen windows and the one beyond which shines so brightly that is certainly the diningroom the blinds are up you know the lie of the land best creep forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heavens sake do nt let them know that they are watched tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard creeping in its shadow reached point whence could look straight through the uncurtained window there were only two men in the room sir henry and stapleton they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table both of them were smoking cigars and coffee and wine were in front of them stapleton was talking with anima tion but the baronet looked pale and distrait perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the illomened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind as watched them stapleton rose and left the room while sir henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair puffing at his cigar heard the creak of door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel the steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which crouched looking over saw the naturalist pause at the door of an outhouse in the corner of the orchard key turned in lock and as he passed in there was curious scuffling noise from within he was only minute or so inside and then heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the house saw him rejoin his guest and crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what had seen you say watson that the lady is not there holmes asked when had finished my report no where can she be then since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen can not think where she is have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung dense white fog it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like wall on that side of us low but thick and well defined the moon shone on it and it looked like great shimmering icefield with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface holmes face was turned towards it and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift it moving towards us watson is that serious very serious indeed the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans he ca nt be very long now it is already ten oclock our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path the night was clear and fine above us the stars shone cold and bright while halfmoon bathed the whole scene in soft uncertain light before us lay the dark bulk of the house its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silverspangled sky broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor one of them was suddenly shut off the servants had left the kitchen there only remained the lamp in the diningroom where the two men the muderous host and the unconscious guest still chatted over their cigars every minute that white woolly plain which covered onehalf of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window the farther wall of the orchard was already invisible and the trees were standing out of swirl of white vapour as we watched it the fogwreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like strange ship upon shadowy sea holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience if he is nt out in quarter of an hour the path will be covered in half an hour we wo nt be able to see our hands in front of us shall we move farther back upon higher ground yes think it would be as well so as the fogbank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half mile from the house and still that dense white sea with the moon silvering its upper edge swept slowly and inexorably on we are going too far said holmes we dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us at all costs we must hold our ground where we are he dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground thank god think that hear him coming sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor crouch ing among the stones we stared intently at the silvertipped bank in front of us the steps grew louder and through the fog as through curtain there stepped the man whom we were await ing he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear starlit night then he came swiftly along the path passed close to where we lay and went on up the long slope behind us as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder like man who is ill at ease hist cried holmes and heard the sharp click of cock ing pistol look out it coming there was thin crisp continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank the cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay and we glared at it all three uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it was at holmess elbow and glanced for an instant at his face it was pale and exultant his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight but sud denly they started forward in rigid fixed stare and his lips parted in amazement at the same instant lestrade gave yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground sprang to my feet my inert hand grasping my pistol my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog hound it was an enormous coalblack hound but not such hound as mortal eyes have ever seen fire burst from its open mouth its eyes glowed with smouldering glare its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame never in the delirious dream of disordered brain could anything more savage more appalling more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog with long bounds the huge black creatwe was leaping down the track following hard upon the footsteps of our friend so paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve then holmes and both fired together and the creature gave hideous howl which showed that one at least had hit him he did not pause however but bounded onward far away on the path we saw sir henry looking back his face white in the moonlight his hands raised in horror glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunt ing him down but that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds if he was vulnerable he was mortal and if we could wound him we could kill him never have seen man run as holmes ran that night am reckoned fleet of foot but he outpaced me as much as outpaced the little professional in front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henry and the deep roar of the hound was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim hurl him to the ground and worry at his throat but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature flank with last howl of agony and vicious snap in the air it rolled upon its back four feet pawing furiously and then fell limp upon its side stooped panting and pressed my pistol to the dreadful shimmering head but it was useless to press the trigger the giant hound was dead sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen we tore away his collar and holmes breathed prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of wound and that the rescue had been in time already our friend eyelids shivered and he made feeble effort to move lestrade thrust his brandyflask between the baronet teeth and two frightened eyes were looking up at us my god he whispered what was it what in heavens name was it it dead whatever it is said holmes we ve laid the family ghost once and forever in mere size and strength it was terrible creature which was lying stretched before us it was not pure bloodhound and it was not pure mastiff but it appeared to be combination of the two gaunt savage and as large as small lioness even now in the stillness of death the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with bluish flame and the small deepset cruel eyes were ringed with fire placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle and as held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness phosphorus said cunning preparation of it said holmes sniffing at the dead animal there is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent we owe you deep apology sir henry for having exposed you to this fright was prepared for hound but not for such creature as this and the fog gave us little time to receive him you have saved my life having first endangered it are you strong enough to stand give me another mouthful of that brandy and shall be ready for anything so now if you will help me up what do you propose to do to leave you here you are not fit for further adventures tonight if you will wait one or other of us will go back with you to the hall he tried to stagger to his feet but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb we helped him to rock where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands we must leave you now said holmes the rest of our work must be done and every moment is of importance we have our case and now we only want our man it thousand to one against our finding him at the house he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path those shots must have told him that the game was up we were some distance off and this fog may have deadened them he followed the hound to call him off of that you may be certain no no he gone by this time but we ll search the house and make sure the front door was open so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of doddering old manservant who met us in the passage there was no light save in the diningroom but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing on the upper floor however one of the bedroom doors was locked there someone in here cried lestrade can hear movement open this door faint moaning and rustling came from within holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open pistol in hand we all three rushed into the room but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for moment staring at it in amazement the room had been fashioned into small museum and the walls were lined by number of glasstopped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man in the centre of this room there was an upright beam which had been placed at some period as support for the old wormeaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof to this post figure was tied so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of man or woman one towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar another covered the lower part of the face and over it two dark eyes eyes full of grief and shame and dreadful questioning stared back at us in minute we had torn off the gag unswathed the bonds and mrs stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us as her beautiful head fell upon her chest saw the clear red weal of whiplash across her neck the brute cried holmes here lestrade your brandy bottle put her in the chair she has fainted from illusage and exhaustion she opened her eyes again is he safe she asked has he escaped he can not escape us madam no no did not mean my husband sir henry is he safe yes and the hound it is dead she gave long sigh of satisfaction thank god thank god oh this villain see how he has treated me she shot her arms out from her sleeves and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises but this is nothing nothing it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled could endure it all illusage solitude life of deception everything as long as could still cling to the hope that had his love but now know that in this also have been his dupe and his tool she broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke you bear him no good will madam said holmes tell us then where we shall find him if you have ever aided him in evil help us now and so atone there is but one place where he can have fled she an swered there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have refuge that is where he would fly the fogbank lay like white wool against the window holmes held the lamp towards it see said he no one could find his way into the grimpen mire tonight she laughed and clapped her hands her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment he may find his way in but never out she cried how can he see the guiding wands tonight we planted them to gether he and to mark the pathway through the mire oh if could only have plucked them out today then indeed you would have had him at your mercy it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and went back with the baronet to baskerville hall the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved but the shock of the night adventures had shattered his nerves and before morning he lay delirious in high fever under the care of dr mortimer the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale hearty man that he had been before he became master of that illomened estate and now come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative in which have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic manner on the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs stapleton to the point where they had found pathway through the bog it helped us to realize the horror of this woman life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband track we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog from the end of it small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those greenscummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger rank reeds and lush slimy waterplants sent an odour of decay and heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces while false step plunged us more than once thighdeep into the dark quivering mire which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us once only we saw trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us from amid tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again he held an old black boot in the air meyers toronto was printed on the leather inside it is worth mud bath said he it is our friend sir henry missing boot thrown there by stapleton in his flight exactly he retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track he fled when he knew the game was up still clutching it and he hurled it away at this point of his flight we know at least that he came so far in safety but more than that we were never destined to know though there was much which we might surmise there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them but no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes if the earth told true story then stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in this cold and cruel hearted man is forever buried many traces we found of him in the boggirt island where he had hid his savage ally huge drivingwheel and shaft halffilled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp in one of these staple and chain with quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined skeleton with tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris dog said holmes by jove curlyhaired spaniel poor mortimer will never see his pet again well do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fath omed he could hide his hound but he could not hush its voice and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear on an emergency he could keep the hound in the outhouse at merripit but it was always risk and it was only on the supreme day which he regarded as the end of all his efforts that he dared do it this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed it was suggested of course by the story of the family hellhound and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death no wonder the poor devil of convict ran and screamed even as our friend did and as we ourselves might have done when he saw such creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track it was cunning device for apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such creature should he get sight of it as many have done upon the moor said it in london watson and say it again now that never yet have we helped to hunt down more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor chapter 15 retrospection it was the end of november and holmes and sat upon raw and foggy night on either side of blazing fire in our sitting room in baker street since the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the nonpareil club while in the second he had defended the unfortunate mme montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her stepdaughter mlle carere the young lady who as it will be remembered was found six months later alive and married in new york my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended succession of difficult and important cases so that was able to induce him to discuss the details of the baskerville mystery had waited patiently for the opportunity for was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past sir henry and dr mortimer were however in london on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves they had called upon us that very after noon so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion the whole course of events said holmes from the point of view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and direct although to us who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts it all appeared exceedingly complex have had the advantage of two conversations with mrs stapleton and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that am not aware that there is anything which has remained secret to us you will find few notes upon the matter under the heading in my indexed list of cases perhaps you would kindly give me sketch of the course of events from memory certainly though can not guarantee that carry all the facts in my mind intense mental concentration has curious way of blotting out what has passed the barrister who has his case at his fingers ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more so each of my cases displaces the last and mlle carere has blurred my recollection of baskerville hall tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous upwood so far as the case of the hound goes however will give you the course of events as nearly as can and you will suggest anything which may have forgotten my inquiries show beyond all question that the family por trait did not lie and that this fellow was indeed baskerville he was son of that rodger baskerville the younger brother of sir charles who fled with sinister reputation to south america where he was said to have died unmarried he did as matter of fact marry and had one child this fellow whose real name is the same as his father he married beryl garcia one of the beauties of costa rica and having purloined considerable sum of public money he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england where he established school in the east of yorkshire his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with consumptive tutor upon the voyage home and that he had used this mans ability to make the undertaking success fraser the tutor died however and the school which had begun well sank from disre pute into infamy the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton and he brought the remains of his fortune his schemes for the future and his taste for entomology to the south of england learned at the british museum that he was recognized authority upon the subject and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to certain moth which he had in his yorkshire days been the first to describe we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us the fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and valuable estate when he went to devonshire his plans were believe exceedingly hazy but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister the idea of using her as decoy was clearly already in his mind though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged he meant in the end to have the estate and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end his first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could and his second was to cultivate friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbours the baronet himself told him about the family hound and so prepared the way for his own death stapleton as will continue to call him knew that the old man heart was weak and that shock would kill him so much he had learned from dr morti mer he had heard also that sir charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously his ingenious mind instantly suggested way by which the baronet could be done to death and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse an ordinary schemer would have been content to work with savage hound the use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was flash of genius upon his part the dog he bought in london from ross and mangles the dealers in fulham road it was the strongest and most savage in their possession he brought it down by the north devon line and walked great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any remarks he had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the grimpen mire and so had found safe hidingplace for the creature here he kennelled it and waited his chance but it was some time coming the old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night several times stapleton lurked about with his hound but without avail it was during these fruitless quests that he or rather his ally was seen by peasants and that the legend of the demon dog received new confirmation he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles to his ruin but here she proved unexpectedly independent she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in senti mental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy threats and even am sorry to say blows refused to move her she would have nothing to do with it and for time stapleton was at deadlock he found way out of his difficulties through the chance that sir charles who had conceived friendship for him made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman mrs laura lyons by representing himself as single man he acquired complete influence over her and he gave her to understandthat in the event of her obtaining divorce from her husband he would marry her his plans were suddenly brought to head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the hall on the advice of dr mortimer with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide he must act at once or his victim might get beyond his power he therefore put pressure upon mrs lyons to write this letter imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for london he then by specious argument prevented her from going and so had the chance for which he had waited driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to get his hound to treat it with his infernal paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting the dog incited by its master sprang over the wicketgate and pursued the unfortunate baronet who fled screaming down the yew alley in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been dreadful sight to see that huge black creature with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes bounding after its victim he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror the hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path so that no track but the man was visible on seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him but finding him dead had turned away again it was then that it left the print which was actually observed by dr mortimer the hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire and mystery was left which puzzled the authorities alarmed the countryside and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation so much for the death of sir charles baskerville you perceive the devilish cunning of it for really it would be almost impossible to make case against the real murderer his only accomplice was one who could never give him away and the grotesque inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective both of the women concerned in the case mrs stapleton and mrs laura lyons were left with strong suspicion against stapleton mrs stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man and also of the existence of the hound mrs lyons knew neither of these things but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him however both of them were under his influence and he had nothing to fear from them the first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr mortimer and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville stapleton first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying trap for the old man and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her it was for this reason that he took her to london with him they lodged find at the mexborough private hotel in craven street which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he disguised in beard followed dr mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the north umberland hotel his wife had some inkling of his plans but she had such fear of her husband fear founded upon brutal illtreatment that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger if the letter should fall into stapletons hands her own life would not be safe eventually as we know she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message and addressing the letter in disguised hand it reached the baronet and gave him the first warning of his danger it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir henry attire so that in case he was driven to use the dog he might always have the means of setting him upon his track with characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once and we can not doubt that the boots or chambermaid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design by chance however the first boot which was procured for him was new one and therefore useless for his purpose he then had it returned and obtained another most instructive incident since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with real hound as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to new one the more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined and the very point which appears to complicate case is when duly considered and scientifically handled the one which is most likely to elucidate it then we had the visit from our friends next morning shad owed always by stapleton in the cab from his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance as well as from his general con duct am inclined to think that stapleton career of crime has been by no means limited to this single baskerville affair it is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country for none of which was any criminal ever arrested the last of these at folkestone court in may was remarkable for the coldblooded pistolling of the page who surprised the masked and solitary burglar can not doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion and that for years he has been desperate and dangerous man we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman from that moment he understood that had taken over the case in london and that therefore there was no chance for him there he returned to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet one moment said you have no doubt described the sequence of events correctly but there is one point which you have left unexplained what became of the hound when its master was in london have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubt edly of importance there can be no question that stapleton had confidant though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him there was an old manservant at merripit house whose name was anthony his connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years as far back as the schoolmastering days so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife this man has disappeared and has escaped from the country it is suggestive that anthony is not common name in england while antonio is so in all spanish or spanishamerican coun tries the man like mrs stapleton herself spoke good english but with curious lisping accent have myself seen this old man cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had marked out it is very probable therefore that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used the stapletons then went down to devonshire whither they were soon followed by sir henry and you one word now as to how stood myself at that time it may possibly recur to your memory that when examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened made close inspection for the water mark in doing so held it within few inches of my eyes and was conscious of faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine there are seventyfive perfumes which it is very necessary that criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition the scent suggested the presence of lady and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons thus had made certain of the hound and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country it was my game to watch stapleton it was evident how ever that could not do this if were with you since he would be keenly on his guard deceived everybody therefore your self included and came down secretly when was supposed to be in london my hardships were not so great as you imagined though such trifling details must never interfere with the investi gation of case stayed for the most part at coombe tracey and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action cartwright had come down with me and in his disguise as country boy he was of great assistance to me was dependent upon him for food and clean linen when was watching stapleton cartwright was frequently watching you so that was able to keep my hand upon all the strings have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly being forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey they were of great service to me and especially that one inci dentally truthful piece of biography of stapleton was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how stood the case had been considerably compli cated through the incident of the escaped convict and the rela tions between him and the barrymores this also you cleared up in very effective way though had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations by the time that you discovered me upon the moor had complete knowledge of the whole business but had not case which could go to jury even stapleton attempt upon sir henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man there seemed to be no alternative but to catch him redhanded and to do so we had to use sir henry alone and apparently unprotected as bait we did so and at the cost of severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving stapleton to his destruction that sir henry should have been exposed to this is must confess reproach to my management of the case but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice we succeeded in our object at cost which both the specialist and dr mortimer assure me will be tempo rary one long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feel ings his love for the lady was deep and sincere and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her it only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear or very possibly both since they are by no means incom patible emotions it was at least absolutely effective at his command she consented to pass as his sister though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder she was ready to warn sir henry so far as she could without implicating her husband and again and again she tried to do so stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady even though it was part of his own plan still he could not help interrupting with passionate out burst which revealed the fiery soul which his selfcontained manner so cleverly concealed by encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired on the day of the crisis however his wife turned suddenly against him she had learned something of the death of the convict and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner she taxed her husband with his intended crime and furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had rival in his love her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him he tied her up therefore that she might have no chance of warning sir henry and he hoped no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the baronet death to the curse of his family as they certainly would do he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew in this fancy that in any case he made miscalculation and that if we had not been there his doom would none the less have been sealed woman of spanish blood does not condone such an irjury so lightly and now my dear watson without referring to my notes can not give you more detailed account of this curious case do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound the beast was savage and halfstarved if its appearance did not frighten its victim to death at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered no doubt there only remains one difficulty if stapleton came into the succession how could he explain the fact that he the heir had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property how could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry it is fomlidable difficulty and fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry but what man may do in the future is hard question to answer mrs stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions there were three possible courses he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers putting him in as heir and retaining claim upon some proportion of his income we can not doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty and now my dear watson we have had some weeks of severe work and for one evening think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels have box for les huguenots have you heard the de reszkes might trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcini for little dinner on the way
