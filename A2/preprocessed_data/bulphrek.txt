phreak encounter barringer had always been bothered by phones not just because people called as he stepped into the shower or because he sometimes got trapped on hold and was forced to listen to muzak or because wrong numbers always waited until he was asleep it was more than that he was bothered by the whole idea of telephones by the way they made people act by the elaborate and unwritten rule of behavior and even language that had evolved to accomodate collection of wires and plastic he was thrown when he was told someone was at certain number as if they actually lived or at least existed at some locus inside switching center some point inside computer defined by an area code an exchange prefix and fourdigit number none of this would have mattered so much if cliff barringer had worked for someone beside the phone company on the other hand if barringer had worked for someone else or had even worked for another department of telephone he probably would nt have given so much thought to the meaning of phones he capitalized it that way in his head the way some people capitalized the meaning of life but even working for the phone company would nt have mattered so much so long as someone at the bank had had better handwriting year before barringer had gotten car loan since he had signed for the loan on the fourth of the month on the fourth of each month thereafter he was expected to pay up but some unknown person had scribbled down the so it looked like and much more common date for loan payment that mistake had taken root somehow become enshrined in some file and now promptly at 1000 on the third of each month mr phillip ramsey called barringer from the bank to tell him that his car payment was fortyeight hours overdue after year of ramsey calls barringer had gotten used to them they were part of the scheme of things just as the sun coming up proved it was new day or seeing new episode of masterpiece theater proved it was sunday night ramsey call was sure sign that march or june or september or whatever month it was had indeed begun the call was just the start of the beginningofthemonth ritual barringer worked out of bethesda office but his job took him all over the washington area and had him on the road practically every day he was out of the office almost every time ramsey called and so each month barringer had to call ramsey back in late afternoon and straighten the whole thing out again ramsey would put barringer on hold and force him to listen to muzak while he checked some other file the ramsey would recall going through it all the month before apologize and forget all about it until the next month when it came time to harass barringer again there was something perfect in the machinelike regularity of it all so it went from month to month until the late afternoon of the third of october 1986 when barringer got the message that ramsey had called that morning he returned the call and got perfectly routine recorded announcement saying that the number had been disconnected barringer had an overactive imagination he tended to worry too much and it was the end of hard day and so that recording gave him chills down his spine barringer had always had the idea that ramsey was his phone number that the man and the number were one and the same combined thing ramsey answered the phone that way each month when barringer called back phillip ramsey 8441754 the name did nt sound complete without the number maybe barringer thought it was ramsey himself who had been disconnected that had ceased to exist barringer had never actually seen ramsey anyway to barringer his loan officer was but slightly nasal voice that was compelled to call him each month on fool errand voice that did its appointed task with the same demented relentlessness of any automatic machine left to its own devices in earlier times disembodied voices had come with messages from god today they demanded that 21315 be remitted promptly there were certainly enough people out there who would delight in the idea that their loan officer had vanished in the hopes that records had vanished along with the man but cliff barringer was good guy also to the point his work for telephone left him wide open to the idea that people and phones could do very strange things to each other he worried besides ramsey had never actually been cruel or unfair just incompetent barringer bore ramsey no ill will had no desire to see him disconnected besides if it could happen to ramsey it could happen to anyone barringer himself might be next it was enlightened selfinterest to see what was up the bank wasnt far away and it never hurt to check the long and short of it was that barringer rushed over to the bank arrived just before closing blundered his way past the best defense three layers of receptionists could put up and found himself in the loan department up against the last of the receptionists friendlylooking woman named miss mcgillicutty mcgillicutty listened to barringer ask for mr ramsey and gave him long hard look the loan department attracted its share of kooks and it was mcgillicutty job to decide who were the dangerous ones the types who would threaten to blow the place because the bank wanted its money back this guy looked pretty much okay bushy brown beard and hair still there but thinning on top clever capable stronglooking hands that had done some manual labor although not recently medium height little pudgy dressed in fairly new work clothes with shirt pocket full of pens and phone company photo id hung on chain around his neck round soft face and eyes that looked neither crazed or threatening or panicked but concerned the eyes decided her this guy did nt want to hurt anyone mr ramsey is busy mr ah barringer but if you could wait perhaps he could talk to you in few minutes thanks but do nt need to talk to him just want to see him make sure he all right barringer said now that he was here in reallooking office talking to real person the idea that man could disappear because of phone number seemed little less likely though still not impossible on the other hand maybe it would be best if he did nt try to explain his worries is he all right see mcgillicutty said although she did nt can promise you mr ramsey is fine there is he across the office third desk from the wall that him the thin guy in the gray suit sort of pale that could be practically anyone around here mcgillicutty thought that him fit as fiddle why did you think he might not be all right that really him somehow the bland looking man across the room still did nt look faceless enough robotic enough to match the nasal monotonous nagging he had endured over the last year you re sure that phillip ramsey 8441754 that is mr ramsey she said carefully right over there but that not his phone number anymore they had to disconnect it this morning because of all the wrong numbers mr ramseys phone was the worst so they unplugged him altogether and he does nt have new phone yet see from your id you re with the phone company are you here to work on the problem what oh no here for myself not on business but it was just wrong numbers he asked feeling both relieved and foolish that all not exactly all she was interrupted by the phone ringing excuse me she picked up the handset to talk loan depart oh damn here mr barringer listen for yourself with certain trepidation cliff barringer took the handset and put it to his ear there was high pitched beeeeeeeep beeeeeeeep that went on and on ah see he said breathing sigh of relief this was suddenly familiar turf this was what he spent his working days on he hung up the phone and spoke that carrier signal from some computer out there somebody is trying to contact computer over phone lines and hook his own computer up to it he programmed his computer to do its own dialing and then told it to call wrong number so it gets you but then we get other calls as soon as anyone answers the person calling just says sorry and hangs up or else does nt say anything at all and hangs up that be people with less fancy computers who are misdialing manually they re expecting to get tone like the one you re getting if they get it they throw the switch and the signal goes into the computer when they hear person they know it must be wrong number and drop the handset that almost makes sense mmmph listen let me do little work on this tonight just on my own can probably get to the computer they re all calling and leave message on it for people to dial more carefully would nt want you to oh no it no trouble fooling with phones and computers is my hobby what do you do for the phone company fool with phones and computers at least you must enjoy your work yeah suppose dr frankenstein probably enjoyed working on the monster at first too that bit extreme is nt it maybe but my job put me in touch with things that scare me track down computerandphone systems that are out of control illegal computer hackers and phone phreaks there are some very weird people out there ve seen what they can do worry what they re going to do next jean mcgillicutty took long look at barringer she was starting to revise her opinion oh barringer was kind of weird all right but past that he seemed pleasant more than pleasant kindly and he looked harmless she thought he looked like he might even be worth talking to in her world that simply meant he did nt look like banker but he was probably shy type she would have to do the pushing hold it its quitting time and mcdonald raw bar is just down the block they sell draught beer cheap it been rough day was planning on having one and hate drinking alone let me be real forward and offer to buy you one barringer blushed and then grinned daddy raised me never to turn down free beer oh it not free in return you have to explain what the hell you re talking about sold fifteen minutes later they were perched on pair of tired old bar stools in dark almost murky tavern that looked like it had nearly been torn down dozen times it was one of the few surviving singlestory buildings in that part of bethesda surrounded on all sides by new construction and new roads all good bars have always looked like they belonged to previous age and the raw bar was no exception mug of beer in one hand and the bowl of peanuts close by the other mcgillicutty was ready to listen comfortably ramshackle bar beat banker office all hollow for conversation okay hackers ve heard of but what freak it spelled little oddly phreak so it ll star the same way phone does people usually draw the sound out little to make the distinction spell it as you will but what phreak ever hear of captain crunch kid cereal right well that where he got the name captain crunch was one of the first phone phreaks from maybe fifteen years ago and he was one of the best he got his name from toy that came in boxes of the cereal toy whistle that just happened to have exactly the right tone so that if you held it up to the phone and blew into it you could cut in some parts of ma bell that civilians were nt supposed to be able to reach the whistle let anyone enter tone commands that the sort of thing phone phreak does he likes to play games with the telco telco telephone company phreaks learn access codes find ways to bill long distance calls to say number at the pentagon mostly it kids fooling around supposedly one guy used one public phone to call the next phone booth over except he routed the call through 50 states and something like four communications satellites and that was maybe twelve years ago long before the first of the personal computers hit the marker you can imagine what phone phreak can do with computer if he can pull those kinds of tricks without one they get sneakier all the time my job is to keep step or two ahead of them what happens when you get behind barringer grinned never happens at least not for long know some stuff ve got some people you know the old saying set thief to catch thief you mean you re an exphreak who gone straight oh no no allergic to cliches what meant was parttimer on the phone police phorce about half the time trouble shooter solving problems when people are having legit phone and computer systems installed that where learned enough to be phone cop in fact six months ago was sworn in as montgomery county deputy sheriff telephone and atlantic bell were involved in so many busts against people doing computer crime that the county decided it was less paper work if few of us had some police powers figure if the regular cops can have stool pigeons so can the phone cops ive got files on twenty or thirty basically harmless kids who have pulled stunts they should nt have if nab kids like that and turn them over to the real cops all ve done is give em an arrest sheet that makes it tough for them later on maybe keeps them out of job makes them mad makes them want to get even with the big bad phone company instead give them good scare then when it looks like they are in deep tell them wo nt pull em in leave em alone and tell them to keep fooling around but not to go overboard in return they get to play spy and let me know if any really bad stuff is happening you do nt look like cop none of the good ones do so give me the facts maam just the facts give me the other numbers in your office that got lot of these calls and lem me buy the next round when barringer got to work on tracking down the computer in question some of his original paranoia came back to him things were little strange but that might have been the our what with getting home and making dinner and playing with the cats and so forth it was midnight before he even got started on the other hand late night was the traditional time for hackers to come out and play finding the computer everyone was trying to call was easy there are four or five basic kinds of mistakes people made when dialing phone numbers transposing certain pairs of digits reading for or vice versa finger slipping from one touchtone button to another and with list of the numbers people actually got when they made mistakes it was easy for barringer to back into the number they had been trying for in five minutes he had list of the most likely numbers barringer had few computers around the house and he powered up clunky ugly lovable old kaypro for the job at hand he brought up his telecommunications program made sure the printer was ready to get down hard copy of everything that happened for later reference and started trying numbers maybe he had been fighting hackers too long it did nt even occur to him that the guy he reached on the first try would nt be too wild over getting call and being hung up on at that hour barringer simply poked his finger down on the hangup switch when he heard hello instead of beep but then barringer had always felt that strangers on the phone were nt real people on the second try he raised carrier tone he pushed some buttons and piped the signal to the kaypro he had been expecting to find business computer system or financial database service something that would attract lot of daytime calls instead signon message that said friendly neighbors electronic bulletin board service popped up on his screen and that was decidedly strange bulletin board service bbs was usually pretty quiet during the day bbss were places where computer hobbyists fooled around leaving each other messages praising or insulting piece of software passing around gossip jokes and computer files it was nighttime stuff most hobbyists had daytime jobs and could nt make calls to the board during business hours barringer had personal rule of thumb for every hundred correctly dialed numbers there was one wrongo for the number of wrongos that had been bugging ramsey and his coworkers there had to be an enormous number of calls made to this number way too many for the average bbs from 900 to 500 this was one popular board what is your first and last name the computer on the other end of the phone asked barringer typed in william heller one of the many realsounding fake names he used in his work are you first time user yes please enter password you will need to enter this password to get access to friendly neighbors so please remember it barringer smiled to himself and typed in ramsey after all ramsey had started this your friendly neighbors bid you welcome following is list of services and programs available on this board the rules of this board are simple for every use of friendly neighbors service you must first tell us new and interesting fact one service one fact we have plenty of phone lines no time limit on use enjoy the friendly sysop it was menudriven system where you were presented with numbered list of things to do each only general description you entered the number of your choice and submenu came up with more detailed list of possibilities you choose from one of those and subsubmenu came up each item on it detailed description of more goodies only at the fourth level did you get down to work menus were good way to run system with lot of things on it and there sure was lot here hell of lot barringer decided the system operator the sysop was one real nice guy the options offered on the menus made his mouth water if ten percent of it was true this was the happy hunting ground for every hacker and hobbyist every wirehead and computer nerd and phone phreak in the world there were working programs and games for every computer he had ever heard of some of them legal public domain stuff but lot of obviously bootlegs of copyrighted progs there were patch lines into practically every college and university computer system in the country there was service that allowed user to call any phoneequipped computer anywhere in the world without charge by calling up the friendly neighbors board and letting it route the call there was search program patched into database with nationwide phone directory including long distance and unlisted numbers you could look up the numbers by name or name by number or either by address you could get the zip code or local equivalent for any place in the world the encyclopaedia brittanica and americana were available not just abstracts but the whole shooting works there online to browse through along with larousse and the great soviet encyclopedia and dozen barringer had never heard of there was complete legal services library search service and patch into the medfax medical research database the ap upi reuters agence france pravda pap the dowjones news service every wire and news service in the world was there the electronic card catalog of the library of congress was online and that just scratched the surface it took halfhour for barringer to get through the various menus all free just give the friendly neighbors sysop an interesting fact care to give us try barringer had to see if it was for real the temptation was too great yes then tell me an interesting fact well what would sysop who had instant access to all that find interesting barringer shrugged the battle of bunker hill really took place on breed hill that is correct thank you what your pleasure he did something he could have done in person something that he could easily do at work he got jean mcgillicutty phone number and address want more tell me another interesting fact ted williams was the greatest player in baseball history an interesting opinion but need facts could it catch fib the potomac is the longest river in the world that is incorrect tell me correct and interesting fact and is that is not interesting you have one more chance or will have to sign you off the aircraft carrier the uss theodore roosevelt is the largest vehicle ever built by man that is correct thank you what your pleasure he checked the latest betting line for the world series and signed off barringer sat there staring at the kaypro screen for ten minutes motionless this had to be the biggest most blatant most thoroughgoing datatheft he had ever seen the friendly neighbors system operator was good at what he did obviously incredibly good but threequarters of the stuff on that board had to be stolen there had to be lot of gossip out there about friendly neighbors the sort of thing most pholks wouldnt tell phone cop for fear he spoil all the phun barringer decided he had to do some talking with certain friend press for some information he used the kaypro to call another board the baker street irregulars bbs barringer got in on the first try something he had never managed before the bsi board was nearly always tied up well who call anything else with the friendly neighbors around all the regular boards would fall on hard times in the face of such competition too bad too the bsi bbs was good board full of fun things to do and try all of then legal it was run by sidney zamoiski one of barringer rephormed phreaks one of his sources of information barringer signed in went to the message section and left brief note garbled in its historical and literary roots but clear to sender and receiver doctor watson come here need you the game afoot he did nt leave his name zamoiski would be in barringer office no later than noon the next day barringer shoved the cats to one side of the bed and tried to get some sleep the next day was saturday but it was nt at all unusual to see barringer in the office on weekends it gave him the chance to catch up on things to clear his decks for the new eek it was easier for him to concentrate without the usual bustle of people around for that matter barringer spent more time out of the office away from the weekday crowds than was really expected of him he was nervous around too many people that did nt matter now it was bright clear morning the place was deserted he had fresh hot thermos of coffee along and he could track down friendly neighbors the first thing to try was the lazy way he called private line internal services operator yes this is employee clifford barringer hey cliff joe walker here how are you oh all right walker was another person cliff had never actually seen and therefore did nt quite believe in got some business to do sure do okay let go by the book punch up your access authority code cliff used his phone touchtone buttons to enter an eight digit number thanks cliff you re you all right what do you need gim me customer name and address on this number he punched in the friendly neighbors number that maryland area code 301 sure is cliff where you been that exchange is nt even hooked up get serious reached that number last night ll run the cnl but telling you that ai nt live exchange barringer waited as walker ran the query not in service cliff run it again swear called that number last night okay there was another slight pause nothing zip it not there check your own books man that not live exchange ll do that thanks joe barringer was beginning to get sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach he checked the telco handbooks it was deader but that was impossible people had very occasionally managed to tap bandit phone line into the system though few even bothered to try it was just too tough too hard to hide too expensive but one bandit phone line would be child play up against creating bandit exchange and why do it to have access to lots of lines but there were up to 10000 phone numbers on an exchange who could possibly need that many walker computer and the handbook must be dated billing he talk to billing they were always up to date he picked up the phone ten minutes later he hung it up again in cold sweat billing had never charged dime to that number it didnt exist and billing confirmed that the whole exchange had never been hooked up in desperation he tried the crisscross directory which listed phone numbers in order against the customers nothing of course he nearly jumped foot when his own phone rang he picked it up as if it were possessed this morning he was starting to get confirmation of his most secret fear that all telephones everywhere were and always had been possessed but it was only security downstairs asking if sid zamoiski could be escorted up barringer said yes and five minutes later one of the uniforms from downstairs delivered zamoiski doctor watson presume barringer said as he stood to shake zamoiski hand hey cliff zamoiski said ve been waiting for your call for while now zamoiski sat himself down in the visitors chair and grinned he did nt look like hacker he looked more like surfer or lumberjack big darkhaired burly young man with handlebar moustache it was hard to imagine him hunched over computer fooling with disk drives and monitors thought you might be friendly neighbors barringer said uhhuh what name did you get in under william heller why thought so try it now under your own name barringer looked oddly at zamoiski and turned to the ibm pc on his desk thirty seconds later he was online to friendly neighbors what is your first and last name cliff barringer you ll never take me alive copper and next time do nt bother calling from telco office number the pc screen filled with gibberish as friendly neighbors cut the connection my god zamoiski said did nt know it could trace the line it knows who am barringer thought he might faint doctor devious you know the pet shop owner in takoma park who runs board told me that he had told friendly neighbors who all the phone cops were that was an interesting fact but if it can trace calls surprised it allowed call from your home phone listen with all you wireheads out there ready to do me in ve got the most unlisted number on earth the telco switching system thinks my phone is across the county line in prince george county ve got three lines crossconnected through legal cheeseboxes to keep phreaks from finding my home okayed it mmmph and if you breathe word of that you ve had your last chinese dinner on me how long has friendly neighbors been in business not long somebody left the message on my bbs about month ago that there was great new board to try has it grown since or did it start out with all that stuff few goodies around the edges but mostly the sysop had it ready to go when he started what the hell is this interesting fact routine got me and do nt ask me why it asks for facts and then tells you that is correct if it knows why ask and heres another weird thing it programmed so it wo nt let me repeat fact ve already given but up to point it ll let me tell it something know it heard from one of the other guys but if over do it it tells me being lazy and demands fresh facts tried to fib to it and it caught me barringer said how could program be that smart think this guy actually licked the artificial intelligence problem you know my theory holmes we wo nt get anywhere on artificial intelligence unless we perfect artificial stupidity first dunno maybe this sysop has done it and get this devious said he tried reading it cards from trivial pursuit friendly neighbors caught him and told him to knock it off jesus this is getting me more and more worried especially since ca nt find them barringer quickly ran through his attempt to get an address for the board that creepy zamoiski thought for moment and suddenly laughed out loud wait second think know how we can find them but not from here we ll go to my place zamoiski lived in blankfaced high rise apartment building in silver spring the place was strangely neat and spare for bachelor home it looked almost barren as if zamoiski camped there instead of living there only one part of the place looked truly occupied mammoth desk covered with hardware and manuals and tools and carryout food containers zamoiski used sanyo for most of his hacking he went straight to it and signed on to friendly neighbors because he was an experienced user the system skipped the rules and the catalog of services and went straight to tell me something more about the battle of midway uhoh zamoiski said every once in while it gets interested in topic you ve told it something about and does this let see the ships of the opposing fleets never saw each other that is correct what your pleasure zamoiski called up the crisscrossing section of the phonebook service let just see how dumb this genius computer is he asked for the home address matching friendly neighbors phone number friendly neighbors obediently betrayed its own location stratford land bethesda barringer read zamoiski you re genius not really but glad to prove my theory about artificial stupidity never seen machine that was nt dumb if you asked it the right question now what well barringer said could act police and wait until monday and get warrant and go in there with some regular cops and so on but dammit got ta meet this guy we go over now yeah who could resist stratford lane was one block long quiet little suburban road cut into the side of gentle hill full of sixtyyearold brick houses children played in the yards and ran back and forth across the quiet street all the lawns were neatly kept all the houses were well cared for except one toward the wilson lane end of the block barringer checked the address again it matched but it could nt be right the house set back bit from the road and on the uphill side of the street was barely visible from the road hidden behind bramble and high trees and tangle of undergrowth that seemed not just to have grown but evolved from lawn left unmowed for quartercentury what could be seen of the house itself did not inspire confidence it had been painted brick many years before but the paint had faded and flaked off until it required more imagination that honesty to call the exterior walls white the shutters were closed but looked rotted and about to fall off the slate roof seemed ready to slide off in one piece worn broken halfcollapsed stone steps led up to an overgrown path through the frontyard forest to the front door an ancient and decrepit blue and white anglia two door resting on four flat tires blocked the way up the stairs the two friends pushed the bramble far enough out of the way to squeeze around the car and headed for the front door of the house barringer happened to glance up as they made their way along the short path he stopped short and grabbed zamoiskis sleeve sid look up at the utility pole what the hell hanging from the pole and running into the second floor of the house was cable as thick as man arm it was dark green and it did nt look so much connected to the junction box on the pole as melted to it barringer shook his head and headed for the front door zamoiski was impressed with barringer for having the nerve to knock not at all surprised when nothing happened taken aback when barringer tried the knob and astonished when he was able to open the door it had nt been locked barringer stepped inside the door turned and called to zamoiski you got flashlight in your car yeah ll get it zamoiski was glad of reason to get away from the house but not at all happy about having to go back the door was wide open and barringer stood in it waiting impatiently zamoiski stepped inside and handed his friend the light barringer flicked on the flashlight and looked around the entire interior of the house had been removed down to the lath the floor was slab of pinkish concrete and barringer had the feeling the concrete filled the houses foundation from the cellar to ground level in one solid block that melted green cable came through the wall over the door and led to thing barringer did nt know what to call it it was boxy shape about four feet square of the same dark green color as the cable it looked halfmelted too its shape softened rounded droopy another green cable led to device barringer and zamoiski both recognized instantly there are certain machines that must be certain shapes if they are to work square wheel can not roll lever must be long and thin to do any good knife must have cutting edge zamoiski gasped as barringer shone the light on twelve foot diameter brightgreen wellpolished very handsome parabolic dish antenna they have to do some measurements and get some tracking done but to zamoiski that would merely be confirmation somewhere in deep space the system operator of the friendly neighbor bulletin board was hard at work always said hackers and phreaks were weird enough to get along with anyone zamoiski said try weird enough to talk to aliens without noticing barringer said he was surprised because he was nt surprised somehow he had always been expecting this suddenly understand the interesting fact rule our friendly neighbors tap into all the great data sources somehow but they have no idea what what which is the junk no one cares about garbage that just accumulated and clogged up the world databases which is the good stuff the people really care about we tell them what we find interesting and they do nt mind two people telling the same fact because that just tells them its interesting to more than one person shudder to think they re getting their view of mankind from hackers zamoiski said gave the poor guys some really dumb stuff very few civilians would care about how to do automatic baudrate shifting for sanyo mbc dunno what do we do now barringer looked at the halfmelted green box we talk to them their mainframe here does nt have local terminal guess we get to phone and sign on let go to my place its closer tell me an interesting fact barringer looked at his friend well what do we say how do you politely say we caught you spying on our planet they are nt spying just looking around and that door was nt locked they must be expecting us lem me get their attention the sysop of this board is an extraterrestrial he typed for the first time there was pause before the program responded then finally message came up on the screen hello neighbor you are no longer limited to the smaller beginner board you have just qualified for provisional membership in the main bulletin board system do you wish to join damn straight do zamoiski said yes he typed the rules of the board are simple tell us about you and well tell you about us answer one of our questions and gain access to one service make sure your printer is engaged and saving hard copy then enter ready we will display an overview listing of services and information available zamoiski switched on the printer and typed ready the choices scrolled past the screen none of them made sense at first but lot of them seemed like fun what looked like databases on hundred planetary systems instructions on how to build some extremely entertaining gadgets telecomputer courses on any number of subjects games that he just had to try zamoiski suddenly felt worried about losing it all before he had chance to play if the local authorities or the feds or even worse the phone company found out they might shut it down for failure to pay one hell of long distance bill zamoiski had an oddly parochial world view cliff he asked we do nt have to tell anyone else about this do we mean earth people like the air force sid this is nt something little like the time you busted into the bank and corrected your balance this is big this is for real the history of humanity and all that we got ta tell the feds have to get started and find out some stuff who are these guys just alien hackers fooling around an invasion and what kind of information are they going to want from us anthropology missile secrets we still do nt know if theyre really friendly the listing finally ended now then our first request again pause barringer held his breath and debated yanking the keyboard back from his friend but zamoiski could simply go to any computer in the world and call on his own the cat was out of the bag the can of worms was opened and zamoiski was just crazy enough to show the neighbors how he had patched into the lawrence livermore lab computer that time in exchange for an hour of gaming what would they want to know the screen cleared another pause and then on the screen tell us more about ted williams barringer sighed in relief think he said it going to be all right roger macbride allen analog science fictionscience fact vol cvi no may 1986 pirated without permission by jolly roger but with hopes of increasing their sales
