healertxt ben blumenberg reality software po box 105 waldoboro me 04572 june 26 1992 the soul healer ve got someone here that you should meet sam seven foot tall magnificence was granite hard and impassive but his voice wavered slightly enough sam enough no not enough you survived and want you to talk to her no yes damn it you will do nt care if you ve decided to die in an avalanche of self pity ve lost all patience with your guilt and selfinflicted torment you survived you are the only survivor you escaped from andersonville revel in it you are alive and life remains and revenge is possible the small slight man sitting opposite sam turned slowly on his stool he stared at sam with look of hate death and indescribable torment his mouth twitched his eyes went blank and unfocused then quickly chaotic and mad then dead then the cycle repeated itself endlessly his eyes with their madness and death seemed unconnected to the rest of the man face or being judging from the eyes the man was truly mad judging from his missing left hand that had been replaced by metal claw the past contained genuine horrors sam took all of this in at glance the sight was familiar he had been closeted with this deranged little man ever since the fellow space shuttle landed on the fringes of akabahs spaceport had he gone too far inwardly sam felt enormous pity and sorrow mixed with bit of admiration for the human wreckage before him andersonville used to be the federation maximum security prison planet it was now run by the gorgons they were certainly benovolent despots except for the activities rumored to take place on andersonville after conquering this quadrant of the galaxy over century ago they soon left the daily governance of most hominid planets intact tax collection and the legal system excepted what could they want with the galaxys most violent incorrigible criminals who were beyond any possibility of rehabilitation rumors abounded about torture bionic engineering and hideous experiments that were performed upon the living and the dead andersonville had acquired reputation as chamber of horrors designed to test the limits not only of human pyschic endurance but human genetic material as well however rumor was rumor and nothing more the fact was noone knew precisely what the gorgons did on their prison planet because no humans had been permitted to either enter or leave andersonville for several decades besides such gossip had all the ear marks of space opera cliche certainly it only reflected racist human attitudes towards their reptilian overlords vicious sadistic criminals were themselves hardly human the federation was best rid of them all of this flashed through sam mind as he confronted the small mad man with the metal hand before him was he truly the first escapee from andersonville his shuttle craft computer memory was coded for andersonville as the place of embarkation no coordinates were given the location of the prison planet remained unknown had the compulog been altered was better evidence of the reality of andersonville the man madness or his metal claw wo nt talk to her ca nt mad you know so is she the man lifted his face to the tygor giant next you ll tell me she also escaped from andersonville no wo nt this girl is not human she is the only soul healer known in our entire universe and she herself claims to be the only one she might possibly be able to help you to calm the whirlwind in your head she might give you hope for the possibility of life after so much pain possibly possibly to sam surprise he heard himself muttering such noble motives tall green one the man metallic voice dripped with contempt what you want is information all can give you about the gorgon dark side true odd thought sam the eyes are mad but the words are not those other possibilities are real false hope neither need nor want simply wish to die the man voice was now monotonic and flat no inflection or emotion infused his words he might have been perhaps was robot so deficient in programming that it could not even imitate human feelings now there is thought mused sam dealing with defective android possibly one of those trained killers replicant ve told you repeatedly ca nt give you any information do nt remember andersonville speak the truth and your metal claw that is also mystery to me sometime events too horrible to encompass are blocked out from the brain recall process but remain within its memory banks this selective unconscious amnesia is common process many people do it with childhood trauma the soul healer can help you penetrate that fear and remember do nt wish to remember do nt wish anything except to be left alone now considering where you ve been the federation can hardly do that sam chuckled audibly but was again the reply was stony silence he sighed very well then he thought without your permission sam opened side door to the windowless grey metallic cubicle in which the interogation had been taking place come in please the soul healer entered she walked slowly glancing neither to the right or left but straight ahead into the future of her dreams tiny petite and voluptuous the girl exuded surprisingly little sexuality considering her appearance rather she gave off an aura of great sadness mixed with hints of awesome power magic truly transcended sex her curly brown hair glistened ringlets cascaded to her shoulders pugnacious upturned nose was singularly out of place her mouth was fine hard and tight lipped her eyes however transfixed all who could look at her for they did not exist no iris or pupil greeted the onlooker where human eyes reside featureless ellipses of greyish almond filled the sockets soul healers were more than blind although they could not see visible light they were mutants who could see through the window of the soul the small man with the metal claw and dead voice looked up it wo nt do any good you know no good at all sam started and the hair on the back of his neck stood up was that sadness in the man voice the soul healer unerringly took the seat sam held for her and faced the prisoner she could easily sense objects with precision ll be back in an hour sam coughed and left the room by the side door if the soul healer could not probe the mans mind his secrets would likely lie buried forever the prisoner and the soul healer stared wordlessly at one another but not for long if you do nt cooperate with me they ll turn you over to father adler the soul healer voice was sweet and warm although deep and husky who is he the man with the dead voice sat motionless on his metal stool staring at the soul healer father adler is the federation chief assassin and he is also master interrogator when he gets through with people they are never the same silence ve been told said the soul healer that you do not refuse food and drink if you want to die why do nt you starve yourself to death do nt know you seem surprisingly ignorant of yourself yes although he had been staring at her for several minutes the man finally consciously noticed the physical presence of the soul healer her beauty and sex made powerful impact although his face remained impassive the tight fitting blue trousers and white jersey accentuated the obvious her seamless gold belt black boots and rhubidium ringlet earrings emphasized her aura of power and rarity the rhubidium stones in her right nostril glistened with iridescent multifaceted hues that changed and transformed moment by moment all of this the prisoner noticed but what quickly overpowered him were her noteyes well not quite dead are we sex pity and remorse not bad not bad the soul healer tone contained just trace of sarcasm sorry said the prisoner do nt be said the soul healer may touch you hold your hands in mine that is how do my work no you may not no one touches me no one ll kill you if you try the man tone was reflected terrible invisible demons wo nt hurt you said the soul healer yes you will said the prisoner softly you wo nt mean to but you will what is your name do nt know may call you anderson then if you wish silence if touch you why will it hurt do nt know but it will unbearably silence ca nt help you if can not hold your hands it does nt matter nothing can help me silence in movement so quick and assured that it caught the prisoner completely off guard the soul healer grabbed and momemtarily held both his hands the one made of flesh and the metal claw but only for second the man screamed and ripped his hands away from the soul healer gaping wound opened up in her left palm he then stood up and threw the metal stool at her head striking glancing blow the soul healer slumped to the floor sam burst in through the side door to find the prisoner holding his head and screaming and the soul healer on the floor her left hand bleeding profusely you animal bellowed sam the soul healer is the gentlest creature in the entire galaxy they do dream repair you idiot sam picked up the prisoner and flung him against the opposite wall of the room he crumpled up and lay silent sam bent over to look at the injured soul healer he watched in amazement as the deep gash in her palm healed itself coagulated blood was absorbed new tissue flowed into the wound and not the tiniest scar remained there was also no visible mark on her head where the stool had struck her the soul healer opened her sightless almond noneyes shook herself and with grace and lightness stood up have your answer sam at least as complete an answer as can provide the tygor giant nodded the gorgons have gone into his brain and altered it in an extraordinary manner the center where dreams originate the locus coerulus in the brain stem has been surgically removed or destroyed and replaced with biocopy the locus coerulus is now composed of cells cloned from nonnervous system tissue they have been grown so as to mimic neurons these fake nerve cells called phenocopies have then been used to construct what appear to be synaptic connections and neural circuitry this new locus coerulus is active biochemically but can not function as nervous tissue in plain language this man can not dream and has no fantasies why would the gorgons want to produce such despair the soul healer did not hestitate wonder if they can not dream and wished to study the process precisely because it is alien to them in effect this poor man has no soul for that is impossible without dreams and fantasies so that is our glimpse into andersonville whispered sam yes tears trickled slowly down the face of the soul healer from her almond noteyes that is not all this man is not without feeling in spite of the bioengineering experiment performed upon him he he was overcome with sorrow and compassion at the sight of me he even wanted to hold and kiss me almost everyone just stares at me and is afraid like you sam the seven foot tall tygor stared down at his feet ca nt help him or us deeply wish that could but can not dream repair is impossible if someone can not dream with strangely distracted gesture the soul healer wiped the tears from her cheeks and disappeared in misty iridescent cloud of purple haze jared colfax who was also known in much of the galaxys underworld as father adler sat opposite the shimmering purple haze that had just appeared in his study he had been thinking of tamar whom he could nt love and who was now dead perhaps because of him relationships were mess he thought and several centuries of practice did nt seem to make his own any easier after obtaining his promise to help in the forthcoming war oriana had promptly disappeared she was nt on kushanah with astreus her whereabouts were truly unknown this is one woman truly love he mused but what kind of love is it im lucky to see and touch the immortal dacian once every decade hardly fulfilling lonely he realized everybody is afraid of me once again and alone the purple haze in front of father adler took form coalesced and became to all appearances the flesh and blood of the soul healer by the gods she is beautiful he thought but then all the women ve cared for seem to be even scarred oriana he looked into the soul healer almond noteyes feeling sorry for yourself jared her voice was soft and sad oh briefly yes you do nt known what loneliness is my friend the only one of my kind in this entire universe and can not return to mine the penrose tunnel through which emerged seems to have disappeared can not find it to jared amazement she hung her head help us while you re here soul healer evil is about to be set loose upon this galaxy oriana says so and that is enough for me my guess is that evil follows the gorgons because they have no souls and can not dream they dilute the good and the true weaken the positive fields and evil flows towards the newly created stress points frankly rather glad you ca nt get home ve come to the same conclusion said the soul healer in barely audible whisper but certainly not happy that im stuck in your universe want to go home the soul healer sounded infinitely sad almost like child ve had it with humans in all their endless variety but infinite sameness such schizophrenic force such love such cruelty there are other beings in the universe soul healer make love to me dacian lord she faced him directly her noteyes in line with his can hold this form for as long as wish make love to me jared part of me will be less lonely for little while and will give you exquisite pleasure part of me is flesh they went to jared stateroom on the flagship and made love in the opulent bedroom on top of green velvet blankets slowly gently longingly they made love the soul healer did give father adler exquisite pleasure and somewhat to her surprise he did likewise to her much later the same day they were in love evil appeared on monday afternoon in the outer arm of rather large spiral galaxy that was the second largest member of galactic cluster quixotically named the local group evil materialized near an old forgotten now uninhabited almost mythical planet called earth the same planet that provided the soil father adler carried in the leather pouch around his neck earth was particularly appropriate place for such an event for it was sterile due to the hominid caused nuclear wars of ages past had humankind not evolved elsewhere in the galaxy as well as on this backwater terran rock hominid history might have ended then
