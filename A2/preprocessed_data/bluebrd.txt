bluebeard once upon time in the fair land of france there lived very powerful lord the owner of estates farms and great splendid castle and his name was bluebeard this was nt his real name it was nickname due to the fact he had long shaggy black beard with glints of blue in it he was very handsome and charming but if the truth be told there was something about him that made you feel respect and little uneasy bluebeard often went away to war and when he did he left his wife in charge of the castle he had had lots of wives all young pretty and noble as bad luck would have it one after the other they had all died and so the noble lord was forever getting married again sire someone would ask now and again what did your wives die of hah my friend bluebeard would reply one died of smallpox one of hidden sickness another of high fever another of terrible infection ah very unlucky and they re unlucky too they re all buried in the castle chapel he added nobody found anything strange about that nor did the sweet and beautiful young girl that bluebeard took as wife think it strange either she went to the castle accompanied by her sister anna who said oh are nt you lucky marrying lord like bluebeard he really is very nice and when you re close his beard does nt look as blue as folk say said the bride and the two sisters giggled delightedly poor souls they had no idea what lay in store for them month or so later bluebeard had the carriage brought round and said to his wife darling must leave you for few weeks but keep cheerful during that time invite whoever you like and look after the castle here he added handing his bride bunch of keys you ll need these the keys of the safe the armoury and the library keys and this one which opens all the room doors now this little key here and he pointed to key that was much smalle than the others opens the little room at the end of the great ground floor corridor take your friends were you want open any door you like but not this one is that quite clear repeated bluebeard not this one nobody at all is allowed to enter that little room and if you ever did go into it would go into such terrible rage that it better that you do nt do nt worry husband said bluebeard wife as she took the keys ll do as you say after giving her hug bluebeard got into his carriage whipped up the horses and off he went the days went by the young girl invited her friends to the castle and showed them round all the rooms except the one at the end of the corridor why should nt see inside the little room why why is it forbidden well she thought about it so much that she ended up bursting with curiosity until one day she opened the door and walked into the little room of all ghastly horrors inside hanging on the walls were the bodies of bluebeards wivws he had strangled them all with his own hands terror stricken the girl ran out of the room but the bunch of keys slipped from her grasp she picked them up without glance and hurried to her own room her heart thumping wildly in her chest horrors she was living ina castle of the dead so that is what had ahppened to bluebeard other wives the girl summoned up her courage and she noticed that one of the keys the very key to the little room was stained with blood must wipe it clean before my husband comes back she said to herself but try as she would the blood stain would nt wash away she washed she scrubbed and she rinsed it all in vain for the key was still red that very evening bluebeard came home just imagine the state his poor wife was in bluebeard did not ask his wife for the keys that same evening but he remarked you look little upset darling has anything nasty happened oh no no are you sorry came back so soon oh no delighted but that night the bride did nt sleep wink next day bluebeard said darling give me back the keys and his wife hurriedly did so bluebeard remarked there one missing the key to the little room is there said the young girl shaking must have left it in my room all right go and get it but when bluebeard wife put the key into his hand bluebeard turned white and in deep hoarse voice demanded why is this key stained with blood do nt know stammered his wife you know very well he retorted you went into the little room did nt you well you ll go back again this time for good along with the other ladies in there you must die oh no pray you you must die he repeated just then there was knock at the door and anna bluebeard wife sister entered the castle good morning she said you seem rather pale not at all we re quite well replied bluebeard his wife whispered in his ear please please give me ten minutes to live bluebeard replied not more than ten the girl ran to her sister anna whohad gone up to one of the towers and asked her anna do you see ou brothers coming they promised they would come and see me today but anna replied no do nt see anyone what wrong you look agitated anna please said the shaken girl look again are you sure you

nt our brothers coming no replied anna again bluebeard shouted up come down at once or ll come up trembling like leaf his wife went downstairs bluebeard was clutching big knife and he grabbed his bride by the hair sister can see two horsemen coming called out anna from the tower that very moment bluebeard made horrible face they too will die his wife knelt to implore please please do nt kill me ll never tell anyone what saw ll never say word yes you ll never say word for eternity snarled bluebeard raising his knife the poor girl screamed have pity on me but he fiercely replied no you must die he was about to bring the knife down on the girls delicate neck when two young men burst into the room dragoon and musketeer they were his wife brothers drawing their swords they leapt towards bluebeard who tried to flee up some stairs but was caught and killed and that was the end of the sad story bluebeard poor wives were given christian burial the castle was completely renovated and the young widow some time later married good and honest young man who helped her to forget the terrible adventure and that young lady completely lost all her sense of curiosity
