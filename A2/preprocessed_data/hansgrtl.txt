hansel and gretel once upon time very poor woodcutter lived in tiny cottage in the forest with his two children hansel and gretel his second wife often illtreated the children and was forever nagging the woodcutter there is not enough food in the house for us all there are too many mouths to feed we must get rid of the two brats she declared and she kept on trying to persuade her husband to abandon his children in the forest take them miles from home so far that they can never find their way back maybe someone will find them and give them home the downcast woodcutter did nt know what to do hansel who one evening had overheard his parents conversation comforted gretel do nt worry if they do leave us in the forest we ll find the way home he said and slipping out of the house he filled his pockets with little white pebbles then went back to bed all night long the woodcutter wife harped on and on at her husband till at dawn he led hansel and gretel away into the forest but as they went into the depths of the trees hansel dropped little white pebble here and there on the mossy green ground at certain point the two children found they really were alone the woodcutter had plucked up enough courage to desert them had mumbled an excuse and was gone night fell but the woodcutter did not return gretel began to sob bitterly hansel too felt scared but he tried to hide his feelings and comfort his sister do nt cry trust me swear ll take you home even if father doesn come back for us luckily the moon was full that night and hansel waited till its cold light filtered through the trees now give me your hand he said we ll get home safely you ll see the tiny white pebbles gleamed in the moonlight and the children found their way home they crept through halfopen window without wakening their parents cold tired but thankful to be home again they slipped into bed next day when their stepmother discovered that hansel and gretel had returned she went into rage stifling her anger in front of the children she locked her bedroom door reproachlng her husband for failing to carry out her orders the weak woodcutter protested torn as he was between shame and fear of disobeying his cruel wife the wicked stepmother kept hansel and gretel under lock and key all day with nothing for supper but sip of water and some hard bread all night husband and wife quarrelled and when dawn came the woodcutter led the children out into the forest hansel however had not eaten his bread and as he walked through the trees he left trail of crumbs behind him to mark the way but the little boy had forgotten about the hungry birds that lived in the forest when they saw him they flew along behind and in no time at all had eaten all the crumbs again with lame excuse the woodcutter left his two children by themselves ve left trail like last time hansel whispered to gretel consolingly but when night fell they saw to their horror that all the crumbs had gone frightened wept gretel bitterly cold and hungry and want to go home do nt be afraid here to look after you hansel tried to encourage his sister but he too shivered when he glimpsed frightening shadows and evil eyes around them in the darkness all night the two children huddled together for warmth at the foot of large tree when dawn broke they started to wander about the forest seeking path but all hope soon faded they were well and truly lost on they walked and walked till suddenly they came upon strange cottaae in the middle of glade this is chocolate gasped hansel as he broke lump of plaster from the wall and this is icing exclaimed gretel putting another piece of wall in her mouth starving but delighted the children began to eat pieces of candy broken off the cottage is nt this delicious said gretel with her mouth full she had never tasted anything so nice we ll stay here hansel declared munching bit of nougat they were just about to try piece of the biscuit door when it quietly swung open well well said an old woman peering out with crafty look and have nt you children sweet tooth come in come in you ve nothing to fear went on the old woman unluckily for hansel and gretel however the sugar candy cottage belonged to an old witch her trap for catching unwary victims the two children had come to really nasty place you re nothing but skin and bones said the witch locking hansel into cage shall fatten you up and eat you you can do the housework she told gretel grimly then ll make meal of you too as luck would have it the witch had very bad eyesight an when gretel smeared butter on her glasses she could see even less let me feel your finger said the witch to hansel every day to check if he was getting any fatter now gretel had brought her brother chicken bone and when the witch went to touch his finger hansel held out the bone you re still much too thin she complained when will you become plump one day the witch grew tired of waltlng light the oven she told gretel we re going to have tasty roasted boy today little later hungry and impatient she went on run and see if the oven is hot enough gretel returned whimpering ca nt tell if it is hot enough or not angrily the wltch screamed at the little girl useless child all right ll see for myself but when the witch bent down to peer inside the oven and check the heat gretel gave her tremendous push and slammed the oven door shut the witch had come to fit and proper end gretel ran to set her brother free and they made quite sure that the oven door was tightly shut behind the witch indeed just to be on the safe side they fastened it firmly with large padlock then they stayed for several days to eat some more of the house till they discovered amongst the witch belongings huge chocolate egg inside lay casket of gold coins the witch is now burnt to cinder said hansel so we ll take this treasure with us they filled large basket with food and set off into the forest to search for the way home this time luck was with them and on the second day they saw their father come out of the house towards them weeping your stepmother is dead come home with me now my dear children the two children hugged the woodcutter promise you ll never ever desert us again said gretel throwing her arms round her father neck hansel opened the casket look father we re rich now you ll never have to chop wood again and they all lived happily together ever after
