bxÂ½ type 4200200 15 second sight mike stutz creative writing dr kirk gim me another cigarette here mark extended his hand and waited as jamie dropped one of her cigarettes into it cancer dave said mark did nt look up you do nt mind do you no go ahead but they re really cancers that what they should be called anyway yeah mark replied legs shifting and hitting an array of bottles and cans that they had laying there is there anything left in that bottle dave asked him no mark said eyes focused outside on the snow they were sitting in the cold paneled livingroom floor of dave new apartment mark with his back to the droning heater was closest to the glass balcony door the smoke from his cigarette drifted to the ceiling where it lingered and slowly ebbed jamie was sipping cola next to him dave was across from the two of them sitting indianstyle the walls of his apartment were painted in bland colors mostly pale yellows and deep greys the room had daves extensive stereo already plugged in and playing his acdc but was otherwise completely bare there were two doorways on the other side of the room one of which led to the bedroom and bathroom the other to the kitchen small coat room and eventually the front door they been cleaning the place up and moving things in since jamie got home from school which was about four oclock and were taking break the bed had been the hardest item to bring in for it had barely fit in the doorway dave small fridge the stereo dresser and medley of breakables were also brought in jamie turned and looked at mark whose eyes were still fixed outside the few banks and office buildings down the road had closed for the weekend for it was already late in the day rush hour traffic was at its peak and many of the motorists having fourtyfive minute trip into the city drove impatiently toward the highway ramp leaves heaped in piles by the road were motionless and smattered with snow across the street an ice cream shop closed for the season was flanked on both sides by sparse northeast ohio woods the large painted cone on the structure side whose top was covered with gentle sprinkling of snow looked like it was to be celestial treat for the gods about one hundred yards to the left the big rotating sign of supermarket turned but went nowhere and yet the snow continued to cheerily frolic through the air this might be bad one jamie said as some of the delicate snow touched the glass door where it instantaneously changed into tiny droplets of water yup mark said between puffs it been this way every year the first snowfall is always rotten at least you have heat dave yeah but you re going to have to show me how to use the thermostat you know how am with these things could nt figure it out on my own do nt worry said jamie you know ca nt believe that you ve finally did it out of all of us you ve been the first to move away from home and this is nice spot too close enough to you parents and us that if you need anything but far away enough to get away from it all dave interjected they sat there for while dave ubiquitous mirrored sunglasses reflecting distorted image of the room and mark still gazing out the window only moving to drop his ashes into the almost empty soda can beside him jamie staring at the two of them started to feel bit uneasy and said something to break the silence you know it seems like it was just yesterday when we were kids remember dave the time when you first got skateboard mark and had wanted so badly to ride it and you would nt let us til we stole it and fell and skinned my knee something awful you caught us just as was running home balling my eyes out remember mark looked up and was the one holding on to the board remember dave you looked mad jamie continued it funny cause still have sort of mark on my right knee and to this day wo nt even go near those damn things hey and how about when we all play tag in the woods we were always too scared to go near that old shack across the creek even when we were twelve or thirteen remember that yeah dave said that was long time ago and if remember correctly it was you that was scared to go near that shack you called it the devil house dontcha remember that mark and hid all of our comic books there you guys did not she smiled mark laughed at the childhood memory it was good spot til that ronnie cummings kid was that his name found them and took them home hey remember him jamie said he was real jerk glad he moved yeah he was the one who was always mocking the girls in the playground just to make them cry no one seemed to like him too much dave said hey uh guys think we better get to moving the rest of the stuff in or we ll be sittin here talkin all night said mark the three of them walked out into the hall whose pine green carpeting was wellworn and whose walls were papered in garish silver and blue print that played tricks to seeing eyes the halls had strange odor to them one of ethnic tenants and chlorine in the lobby jamie gave weak smile to an older man sitting in one of the worn tattered couches the vigor of his youth was long gone the wink he directed to her looked not charming but more like an obscene gesture mark van was parked by the side entrance and they gathered around the back hatch which mark unlocked lets see here dave we ve got your couch the table two more chairs and lots of clothes guess ll take the clothes dave said flakes of snow stuck to his glasses and wet his blonde hair jamie looked comfortable in her suede jacket and her long auburn hair kept her head sort of warm but mark who said he was cold looked like he had no intention of loitering in the wintry weather he handed chair to jamie and took one for himself their loads were brought back to the apartment after which they came back down for the couch in passing the lobby jamie intentionally avoided being probed by the old man eyes by inconspicuously hiding behind mark other shoulder the man mere presence gave her an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of her stomach she took deep breath and released it when they went outside where it became cold wisp of vapor for brief moment does nt it smell good out here dave asked yeah said jamie it kinda fresh countryish sorta this is the country sorta said mark jamie thought for second hmm maybe that why jamie you wan na hold that end ca nt carry this couch alone they brought it up to the apartment and by their last trip out for the table they already gotten used to the hallway smell the old man erupted into terrible fit of coughing and put his head down the table was surprisingly lightweight and they were able to bring it into daves kitchen with ease after things were pretty much in order they were feeling parched and hungry it only eight thirty on friday night mark said hell we should order somethin you guys wan na pick up some pizza or something like that dave got up from his chair anything but chinese food do nt want to be hungry half hour later yeah well starving jamie said from the couch she got up put her jacket on over her wool sweater and lit up cigarette she motioned the box to mark who eagerly took one she then handed dave his white cane ahh thanks darling he said my pleasure she replied do you want to drive mark laughed and placed his keys into dave hand okay dave said with chuckle let go then cmon partner jamie told him and she placed her hand on his shoulder he appeared exalted through his scratched shades mark was already out the door well dudes waiting they locked up the apartment and strolled down the hall dave using his cane in the way swordfighter brandishes his weapon touche he said as he blindly took swing gently striking mark on the back laughing as they went out the glass door into the chilly evening jamie did nt even look at the old man she was too busy talking to her friends
