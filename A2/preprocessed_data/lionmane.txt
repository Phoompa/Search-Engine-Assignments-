and unusual as any which have faced in my long professional career should have come to me after my retirement and be brought as it were to my very door it occurred after my withdrawal to my little sussex home when had given myself up entirely to that soothing life of nature for which had so often yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of london at this period of my life the good watson had passed almost beyond my ken an occasional weekend visit was the most that ever saw of him thus must act as my own chronicler ah had he but been with me how much he might have made of so wonderful happening and of my eventual triumph against every difficulty as it is however must needs tell my tale in my own plain way showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which lay before me as searched for the mystery of the lion mane my villa is situated upon the southern slope of the downs commanding great view of the channel at this point the coastline is entirely of chalk cliffs which can only be descended by single long tortuous path which is steep and slippery at the bottom of the path lie hundred yards of pebbles and shingle even when the tide is at full here and there however there are curves and hollows which make splendid swimming pools filled afresh with each flow this admirable beach extends for some miles in each direction save only at one point where the little cove and village of fulworth break the line my house is lonely my old housekeeper and my bees have the estate all to ourselves half mile off however is harold stackhurst wellknown coaching establishment the gables quite large place which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various professions with staff of several masters stackhurst himself was wellknown rowing blue in his day and an excellent allround scholar he and were always friendly from the day came to the coast and he was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on each other in the evenings without an invitation towards the end of july 1907 there was severe gale the wind blowing upchannel heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs and leaving lagoon at the turn of the tide on the morning of which speak the wind had abated and all nature was newly washed and fresh it was impossible to work upon so delightful day and strolled out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air walked along the cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach as walked heard shout behind me and there was harold stackhurst waving his hand in cheery greeting what morning mr holmes thought should see you out going for swim see at your old tricks again he laughed patting his bulging pocket yes mcpherson started early and expect may find him there fitzroy mcpherson was the science master fine upstanding young fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic fever he was natural athlete however and excelled in every game which did not throw too great strain upon him summer and winter he went for his swim and as am swimmer myself have often joined him at this moment we saw the man himself his head showed above the edge of the cliff where the path ends then his whole figure appeared at the top staggering like drunken man the next instant he threw up his hands and with terrible cry fell upon his face stackhurst and rushed forward it may have been fifty yards and turned him on his back he was obviously dying those glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else one glimmer of life came into his face for an instant and he uttered two or three words with an eager air of warning they were slurred and indistinct but to my ear the last of them which burst in shriek from his lips were the lions mane it was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible and yet could twist the sound into no other sense then he half raised himself from the ground threw his arms into the air and fell forward on his side he was dead my companion was paralyzed by the sudden horror of it but as may well be imagined had every sense on the alert and had need for it was speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary case the man was dressed only in his burberry overcoat his trousers and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes as he fell over his burberry which had been simply thrown round his shoulders slipped off exposing his trunk we stared at it in amazement his back was covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by thin wire scourge the instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted was clearly flexible for the long angry weals curved round his shoulders and ribs there was blood dripping down his chin for he had bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony his drawn and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been was kneeling and stackhurst standing by the body when shadow fell across us and we found that ian murdoch was by our side murdoch was the mathematical coach at the establish ment tall dark thin man so taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend he seemed to live in some high abstract region of surds and conic sections with little to connect him with ordinary life he was looked upon as an oddity by the students and would have been their butt but there was some strange outlandish blood in the man which showed itself not only in his coalblack eyes and swarthy face but also in occa sional outbreaks of temper which could only be described as ferocious on one occasion being plagued by little dog be longing to mcpherson he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the plateglass window an action for which stackhurst would certainly have given him his dismissal had he not been very valuable teacher such was the strange complex man who now appeared beside us he seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before him though the incident of the dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and himself poor fellow poor fellow what can do how can help were you with him can you tell us what has happened no no was late this morning was not on the beach at all have come straight from the gables what can do you can hurry to the policestation at fulworth report the matter at once without word he made off at top speed and proceeded to take the matter in hand while stackhurst dazed at this tragedy remained by the body my first task naturally was to note who was on the beach from the top of the path could see the whole sweep of it and it was absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen far away moving towards the village of fulworth having satisfied myself upon this point walked slowly down the path there was clay or soft marl mixed with the chalk and every here and there saw the same footstep both ascending and descending no one else had gone down to the beach by this track that morning at one place observed the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline this could only mean that poor mcpherson had fallen as he ascended there were rounded depressions too which suggested that he had come down upon his knees more than once at the bottom of the path was the considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide at the side of it mcpherson had undressed for there lay his towel on rock it was folded and dry so that it would seem that after all he had never entered the water once or twice as hunted round amid the hard shingle came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas shoe and also of his naked foot could be seen the latter fact proved that he had made all ready to bathe though the towel indicated that he had not actually done so and here was the problem clearly defined as strange one as had ever confronted me the man had not been on the beach more than quarter of an hour at the most stackhurst had followed him from the gables so there could be no doubt about that he had gone to bathe and had stripped as the naked foot steps showed then he had suddenly huddled on his clothes again they were all dishevelled and unfastened and he had returned without bathing or at any rate without drying himself and the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been scourged in some savage inhuman fashion tortured until he bit his lip through in his agony and was left with only strength enough to crawl away and to die who had done this barbarous deed there were it is true small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs but the low sun shone directly into them and there was no place for concealment then again there were those distant figures on the beach they seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime and the broad lagoon in which mcpherson had intended to bathe lay between him and them lapping up to the rocks on the sea two or three fishing boats were at no great distance their occupants might be exam ined at our leisure there were several roads for inquiry but none which led to any very obvious goal when at last returned to the body found that little group of wondering folk had gathered round it stackhurst was of course still there and ian murdoch had just arrived with ander son the village constable big gingermoustached man of the slow solid sussex breed breed which covers much good sense under heavy silent exterior he listened to everything took note of all we said and finally drew me aside be glad of your advice mr holmes this is big thing for me to handle and ll hear of it from lewes if go wrong advised him to send for his immediate superior and for doctor also to allow nothing to be moved and as few fresh footmarks as possible to be made until they came in the meantime searched the dead man pockets there were his handkerchief large knife and small folding cardcase from this projected slip of paper which unfolded and handed to the constable there was written on it in scrawling feminine hand will be there you may be sure maudie it read like love affair an assignation though when and where were blank the constable replaced it in the cardcase and returned it with the other things to the pockets of the burberry then as nothing more suggested itself walked back to my house for breakfast having first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly searched stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had been removed to the gables where the inquest would be held he brought with him some serious and definite news as expected nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff but he had examined the papers in mcpherson desk and there were several which showed an intimate correspondence with certain miss maud bellamy of fulworth we had then established the identity of the writer of the note the police have the letters he explained could not bring them but there is no doubt that it was serious love affair see no reason however to connect it with that horrible happening save indeed that the lady had made an appointment with him but hardly at bathingpool which all of you were in the habit of using remarked it is mere chance said he that several of the students were not with mcpherson was it mere chance stackhurst knit his brows in thought ian murdoch held them back said he he would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast poor chap he is dreadfully cut up about it all and yet gather that they were not friends at one time they were not but for year or more murdoch has been as near to mcpherson as he ever could be to anyone he is not of very sympathetic disposition by nature so understand seem to remember your telling me once about quarrel over the illusage of dog that blew over all right but left some vindictive feeling perhaps no no am sure they were real friends well then we must explore the matter of the girl do you know her everyone knows her she is the beauty of the neighbourhood real beauty holmes who would draw attention everywhere knew that mcpherson was attracted by her but had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate but who is she she is the daughter of old tom bellamy who owns all the boats and bathingcots at fulworth he was fisherman to start with but is now man of some substance he and his son william run the business shall we walk into fulworth and see them on what pretext oh we can easily find pretext after all this poor man did not illuse himself in this outrageous way some human hand was on the handle of that scourge if indeed it was scourge which inflicted the injuries his circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive which in turn should lead us to the criminal it would have been pleasant walk across the thymescented downs had our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed the village of fulworth lies in hollow curving in semicircle round the bay behind the oldfashioned hamlet sev eral modern houses have been built upon the rising ground it was to one of these that stackhurst guided me that the haven as bellamy called it the one with the corner tower and slate roof not bad for man who started with nothing but by jove look at that the garden gate of the haven had opened and man had emerged there was no mistaking that tall angular straggling figure it was ian murdoch the mathematician moment later we confronted him upon the road hullo said stackhurst the man nodded gave us side ways glance from his curious dark eyes and would havepassed us but his principal pulled him up what were you doing there he asked murdoch face flushed with anger am your subordinate sir under your roof am not aware that owe you any account of my private actions stackhurst nerves were near the surface after all he had endured otherwise perhaps he would have waited now he lost his temper completely in the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence mr murdoch your own question might perhaps come under the same heading this is not the first time that have had to overlook your insubordinate ways it will certainly be the last you will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can had intended to do so have lost today the only person who made the gables habitable he strode off upon his way while stackhurst with angry eyes stood glaring after him is he not an impossible intoler able man he cried the one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that mr ian murdoch was taking the first chance to open path of escape from the scene of the crime suspicion vague and nebulous was now beginning to take outline in my mind per haps the visit to the bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter stackhurst pulled himself together and we went forward to the house mr bellamy proved to be middleaged man with flaming red beard he seemed to be in very angry mood and his face was soon as florid as his hair no sir do not desire any particulars my son here indicating powerful young man with heavy sullen face in the corner of the sittingroom is of one mind with me that mr mcpherson attentions to maud were insulting yes sir the word marriage was never mentioned and yet there were letters and meetings and great deal more of which neither of us could approve she has no mother and we are her only guardians we are determined but the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady herself there was no gainsaying that she would have graced any assembly in the world who could have imagined that so rare flower would grow from such root and in such an atmosphere women have seldom been an attraction to me for my brain has always governed my heart but could not look upon her perfect clearcut face with all the soft freshness of the downlands in her delicate colouring without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed such was the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now wideeyed and intense in front of harold stackhurst know already that fitzroy is dead she said do not be afraid to tell me the particulars this other gentleman of yours let us know the news explained the father there is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter growled the younger man the sister turned sharp fierce look upon him this is my business william kindly leave me to manage it in my own way by all accounts there has been crime committed if can help to show who did it it is the least can do for him who is gone she listened to short account from my companion with composed concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as well as great beauty maud bellamy will always remain in my memory as most complete and remark able woman it seems that she already knew me by sight for she turned to me at the end bring them to justice mr holmes you have my sympathy and my help whoever they may be it seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at her father and brother as she spoke thank you said value woman instinct in such matters you use the word they you think that more than one was concerned knew mr mcpherson well enough to be aware that he was brave and strong man no single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him might have one word with you alone tell you maud not to mix yourself up in the matter cried her father angrily she looked at me helplessly what can do the whole world will know the facts presently so there can be no harm if discuss them here said should have preferred privacy but if your father will not allow it he must share the deliberations then spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man pocket it is sure to be produced at the inquest may ask you to throw any light upon it that you can see no reason for mystery she answered we were engaged to be married and we only kept it secret because fitzroy uncle who is very old and said to be dying might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish there was no other reason you could have told us growled mr bellamy so would father if you had ever shown sympathy object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station it was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you as to this appointment she fumbled in her dress and produced crumpled note it was in answer to this dearest ran the message the old place on the beach just after sunset on tuesday it is the only time can get away fm tuesday was today and had meant to meet him tonight turned over the paper this never came by post how did you get it would rather not answer that question it has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating but anything which bears upon that will most freely answer she was as good as her word but there was nothing which was helpful in our investigation she had no reason to think that her fiance had any hidden enemy but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers may ask if mr ian murdoch was one of them she blushed and seemed confused there was time when thought he was but that was all changed when he understood the relations between fitzroy and myself again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more definite shape his record must be examined his rooms must be privately searched stackhurst was willing collaborator for in his mind also suspicions were forming we returned from our visit to the haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already in our hands week passed the inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had been adjourned for further evidence stackhurst had made discreet inquiry about his subordinate and there had been superficial search of his room but without result person ally had gone over the whole ground again both physically and mentally but with no new conclusions in all my chronicles the reader will find no case which brought me so completely to the limit of my powers even my imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery and then there came the incident of the dog it was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange wireless by which such people collect the news of the countryside sad story this sir about mr mcpherson dog said she one evening do not encourage such conversations but the words arrested my attention what of mr mcpherson dog dead sir died of grief for its master who told you this why sir everyone is talking of it it took on terrible and has eaten nothing for week then today two of the young gentlemen from the gables found it dead down on the beach sir at the very place where its master met his end at the very place the words stood out clear in my mem ory some dim perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind that the dog should die was after the beautiful faithful nature of dogs but in the very place why should this lonely beach be fatal to it was it possible that it also had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud was it possible yes the perception was dim but already something was building up in my mind in few minutes was on my way to the gables where found stackhurst in his study at my request he sent for sudbury and blount the two students who had found the dog yes it lay on the very edge of the pool said one of them it must have followed the trail of its dead master saw the faithful little creature an airedale terrier laid out upon the mat in the hall the body was stiff and rigid the eyes projecting and the limbs contorted there was agony in every line of it from the gables walked down to the bathingpool the sun had sunk and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water which glimmered dully like sheet of lead the place was deserted and there was no sign of life save for two seabirds circling and screaming overhead in the fading light could dimly make out the little dog spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master towel had been laid for long time stood in deep meditation while the shadows grew darker around me my mind was filled with racing thoughts you have known what it was to be in nightmare in which you feel that there is some allimportant thing for which you search and which you know is there though it remains forever just beyond your reach that was how felt that evening as stood alone by that place of death then at last turned and walked slowly homeward had just reached the top of the path when it came to me like flash remembered the thing for which had so eagerly and vainly grasped you will know or watson has written in vain that hold vast store of outoftheway knowledge with out scientific system but very available for the needs of my work my mind is like crowded boxroom with packets of all sorts stowed away therein so many that may well have but vague perception of what was there had known that there was something which might bear upon this matter it was still vague but at least knew how could make it clear it was monstrous incredible and yet it was always possibility would test it to the full there is great garret in my little house which is stuffed with books it was into this that plunged and rummaged for an hour at the end of that time emerged with little chocolate and silver volume eagerly turned up the chapter of which had dim remembrance yes it was indeed farfetched and unlikely proposition and yet could not be at rest until had made sure if it might indeed be so it was late when retired with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the morrow but that work met with an annoying interruption had hardly swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when had call from inspector bardle of the sussex con stabulary steady solid bovine man with thoughtful eyes which looked at me now with very troubled expression know your immense experience sir said he this is quite unofficial of course and need go no farther but am fairly up against it in this mcpherson case the question is shall make an arrest or shall not meaning mr ian murdoch yes sir there is really no one else when you come to think of it that the advantage of this solitude we narrow it down to very small compass if he did not do it then who did what have you against him he had gleaned along the same furrows as had there was murdoch character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man his furious bursts of temper as shown in the incident of the dog the fact that he had quarrelled with mcpher son in the past and that there was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to miss bellamy he had all my points but no fresh ones save that murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure what would my position be if let him slip away with all this evidence against him the burly phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his mind consider said all the essential gaps in your case on the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi he had been with his scholars till the last moment and within few minutes of mcpherson appearance he came upon us from behind then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could singlehanded have inflicted this outrage upon man quite as strong as himself finally there is this question of the instru ment with which these injuries were inflicted what could it be but scourge or flexible whip of some sort have you examined the marks asked have seen them so has the doctor but have examined them very carefully with lens they have peculiarities what are they mr holmes stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photo graph this is my method in such cases explained you certainly do things thoroughly mr holmes should hardly be what am if did not now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder do you observe nothing remarkable ca nt say do surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity there is dot of extravasated blood here and another there there are similar indications in this other weal down here what can that mean have no idea have you perhaps have perhaps have nt may be able to say more soon anything which will define what made that mark will bring us long way towards the criminal it is of course an absurd idea said the policeman but if redhot net of wire had been laid across the back then these better marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other most ingenious comparison or shall we say very stiff catoninetails with small hard knots upon it by jove mr holmes think you have hit it or there may be some very different cause mr bardle but your case is far too weak for an arrest besides we have those last words the lion mane have wondered whether ian yes have considered that if the second word had borne any resemblance to murdoch but it did not he gave it almost in shriek am sure that it was mane have you no alternative mr holmes perhaps have but do not care to discuss it until there is something more solid to discuss and when will that be in an hour possibly less the inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes wish could see what was in your mind mr holmes perhaps it those fishingboats no no they were too far out well then is it bellamy and that big son of his they were not too sweet upon mr mcpherson could they have done him mischief no no you wo nt draw me until am ready said with smile now inspector we each have our own work to do perhaps if you were to meet me here at midday so far we had got when there came the tremendous interrup tion which was the beginning of the end my outer door was flung open there were blundering foot steps in the passage and ian murdoch staggered into the room pallid dishevelled his clothes in wild disorder clawing with his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect brandy brandy he gasped and fell groaning upon the sofa he was not alone behind him came stackhurst hatless and panting almost as distrait as his companion yes yes brandy he cried the man is at his last gasp it was all could do to bring him here he fainted twice upon the way half tumbler of the raw spirit brought about wondrous change he pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from his shoulders for god sake oil opium morphia he cried anything to ease this infernal agony the inspector and cried out at the sight there crisscrossed upon the man naked shoulder was the same strange reticulated pattern of red inflamed lines which had been the deathmark of fitzroy mcpherson the pain was evidently terrible and was more than local for the sufferer breathing would stop for time his face would turn black and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart while his brow dropped beads of sweat at any moment he might die more and more brandy was poured down his throat each fresh dose bringing him back to life pads of cottonwool soaked in saladoil seemed to take the agony from the strange wounds at last his head fell heavily upon the cushion ex hausted nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse of vitality it was half sleep and half faint but at least it was ease from pain to question him had been impossible but the moment we were assured of his condition stackhurst turned upon me my god he cried what is it holmes what is it where did you find him down on the beach exactly where poor mcpherson met his end if this man heart had been weak as mcpherson was he would not be here now more than once thought he was gone as brought him up it was too far to the gables so made for you did you see him on the beach was walking on the cliff when heard his cry he was at the edge of the water reeling about like drunken man ran down threw some clothes about him and brought him up for heaven sake holmes use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place for life is becoming unendurable can you with all your worldwide reputation do nothing for us think can stackhurst come with me now and you inspector come along we will see if we can not deliver this murderer into your hands leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my house keeper we all three went down to the deadly lagoon on the shingle there was piled little heap of towels and clothes left by the stricken man slowly walked round the edge of the water my comrades in indian file behind me most of the pool was quite shallow but under the cliff where the beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep it was to this part that swimmer would naturally go for it formed beautiful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal line of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff and along this led the way peering eagerly into the depths beneath me had reached the deepest and stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching and burst into shout of triumph cyanea cried cyanea behold the lion mane the strange object at which pointed did indeed look like tangled mass torn from the mane of lion it lay upon rocky shelf some three feet under the water curious waving vibrat ing hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses it pulsated with slow heavy dilation and contraction it has done mischief enough its day is over cried help me stackhurst let us end the murderer forever there was big boulder just above the ledge and we pushed it until it fell with tremendous splash into the water when the ripples had cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below one flapping edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round rising slowly to the surface well this gets me cried the inspector what was it mr holmes born and bred in these parts but never saw such thing it do nt belong to sussex just as well for sussex remarked it may have been the southwest gale that brought it up come back to my house both of you and will give you the terrible experience of one who has good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas when we reached my study we found that murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit up he was dazed in mind and every now and then was shaken by paroxysm of pain in broken words he explained that he had no notion what had occurred to him save that terrific pangs had suddenly shot through him and that it had taken all his fortitude to reach the bank here is book said taking up the little volume which first brought light into what might have been forever dark it is out of doors by the famous observer wood wood himself very nearly perished from contact with this vile creature so he wrote with very full knowledge cyanea capillata is the miscreant full name and he can be as dangerous to life as and far more painful than the bite of the cobra let me briefly give this extract if the bather should see loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and fibres something like very large handfuls of lion mane and silver paper let him beware for this is the fearful stinger cyanea capillata could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described he goes on to tell of his own encounter with one when swimming off the coast of kent he found that the creature radiated almost invisible filaments to the distance of fifty feet and that anyone within that circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death even at distance the effect upon wood was almost fatal the multitudinous threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer examination resolved into minute dots or pustules each dot charged as it were with redhot needle making its way through the nerves the local pain was as he explains the least part of the exquisite torment pangs shot through the chest causing me to fall as if struck by bullet the pulsation would cease and then the heart would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the chest it nearly killed him although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of bathingpool he says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards so white wrinkled and shrivelled was his face he gulped down brandy whole bottleful and it seems to have saved his life there is the book inspector leave it with you and you can not doubt that it contains full explanation of the tragedy of poor mcpherson and incidentally exonerates me remarked ian murdoch with wry smile do not blame you inspector nor you mr holmes for your suspicions were natural feel that on the very eve of my arrest have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend no mr murdoch was already upon the track and had been out as early as intended might well have saved you from this terrific experience but how did you know mr holmes am an omnivorous reader with strangely retentive mem ory for trifles that phrase the lion mane haunted my mind knew that had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context you have seen that it does describe the creature have no doubt that it was floating on the water when mcpherson saw it and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us warning as to the creature which had been his death then at least am cleared said murdoch rising slowly to his feet there are one or two words of explanation which should give for know the direction in which your inquiries have run it is true that loved this lady but from the day when she chose my friend mcpherson my one desire was to help her to happiness was well content to stand aside and act as their gobetween often carried their messages and it was because was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that hastened to tell her of my friend death lest someone should forestall me in more sudden and heartless manner she would not tell you sir of our relations lest you should disapprove and might suffer but with your leave must try to get back to the gables for my bed will be very welcome stackhurst held out his hand our nerves have all been at concertpitch said he forgive what is past murdoch we shall understand each other better in the future they passed out together with their arms linked in friendly fashion the inspector remained staring at me in silence with his oxlike eyes well you ve done it he cried at last had read of you but never believed it it wonderful was forced to shake my head to accept such praise was to lower one own standards was slow at the outset culpably slow had the body been found in the water could hardly have missed it it was the towel which misled me the poor fellow had never thought to dry himself and so in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water why then should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me that was where went astray well well inspector often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force but cyanea capillata very nearly avenged scot land yard
