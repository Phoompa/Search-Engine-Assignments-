bianco to break for the jump ship he was going to confirm who was attacking like bat out of hell was roger out of the clouds redirecting power to his engines pushing it for all it was worth he took several hits crippling his craft by the time he was over the base he glanced down and saw it gleaming red coiled dragon draconis 2nd lt nick bianco looked over his shoulder at his flight leader running on the base his craft just broke out of the clouds he caught sight roger ship and watched as it sped over the assault force nick radio came alive and he heard draconis as he saw his flight
