the zorker story all right all right let get some work done here bruce shouted above the din he waited few moments for the noise to settle down and when it did nt he strode up to the stage and picked up the megaphone quiet down already he cried the students startled by the loud voice turned to him and were quiet that better he said without the megaphone listen sort of like to get through this scene so if youd all pick up your books hey great okay it page 82 act two scene two of the tempest eric you play caliban ed can play trinculo and alex can play stephano the rest of you he added through the growing mumble of dissatisfied aspiring actors listen for the things we talked about symbolism huh okay eric take it away all the infections that the sun sucks up bruce jumped off the stage and went to sit in the back of the auditorium it was really too big for classroom but as the only room in the school with stage it sufficed as the two drunks decided what to do with the strange monster caliban bruce sighed and leaned back in the seat bruce williams was the teacher of eleventh grade drama known for his odd combination of expertise in shakespeare and twentieth century drama he was wellliked by the students for his easy informal demeanor for this same reason he was mistrusted by other teachers and the principal he was secure in his job because of his excellent credentials his short but notable professional theater career earned him the job and he did good job so although people complained about his un orthodox methods his record was unshakable he enjoyed the work lot it reminded him of his own work at that age when he had really loved acting on the stage no glamour now no applause but just his students doing well and enjoying the class that was gratification enough he sat through the scene halflistening to the unac centuated high school speech more than once he had requested the course be audition required but as it was the only drama class the school had decided that it should nt be restricted some of shakespeare odd wording provoked laughter from the kids but they listened carefully under the direction of bruce he flipped through few odd bulletins and notices while the scene went on brave monster lead the way exclaimed his student alex as stephano there was short silence after he finished the line then the class began talking loudly again but before bruce could say word the bell rang signifying end of class in their friday eagerness to leave the class they pushed past him ignoring his pleas for them to think about the scene for tomorrow now he was alone in the makeshift theater he stood and walked down the aisle of seats looking up and down the rows somebody had forgotten his book bruce picked it up and tucked it under his arm he would return it tomorrow probably with one of his corny jokes like shakespeare labors lost the rest of the room was clean so he turned to leave he only had two classes in day one of them second hour and the other right after lunch after the second he could leave he walked down the halls avoiding the crush of students racing the clock to reach their next class he thought briefly that if they ran in phys ed like they did in the halls their 50yard dash scores might be lot better hi mr williams bruce turned his head towards the anonymous caller and smiled probably one of his students although his fame as teacher had spread even to the non dramatically inclined he continued through the mob which thinned out until the final bell rang and the halls cleared he checked off his name at the main office and then left the building to the parking lot his blue nondescript little car was parked in space close to the door there was ticket tucked under the windshield wiper what the hell bruce exclaimed and trailed off he snatched up the ticket and read it but it was nt ticket after all it was short note bruce call me when you get home joshua joshua monlley was bruce personal accountant personal advisor and personal friend bruce often joked about taking the two out of joshua last name to describe him better this was actually true not that he was particularly avaricious but he did have an amazing knack for making money bruce got in the car and turned on the ignition he let it idle for few moments while he thought about the note it was strange that joshua should leave note like this either he would call bruce at home himself or if it was really urgent call him at the school but why note under the windshield bruce stepped on the gas and pulled out of the parking lot he was always happy to leave early beating the usual rushhour traffic most teachers had to deal with he drove fairly fast through the almost deserted back streets his house was on large street about five miles from the school convenient location because it had the added bonus of shopping right around the corner not that bruce needed much but he did tend to eat he parked in the driveway and walked up the three or four steps to his front door letting himself in the first thing he did was to go to his study and sit down at the desk to call joshua something made him do it the note had had peculiar sense of urgency casually worded though it was quickly he tapped the memorized numbers off joshua office on the telephone and listened at the receiver the phone rang once twice three times four times and it was answered good afternoon mr monlley office how can help you bruce recognized the smooth low voice of joshua secret ary hello paige it bruce williams why hello mr williams how are you fine thanks is mr monlley in yes he is the secretary said hold please bruce was eternally thankful that joshua office did nt play innocuous muzak during telephone hold heyyy shakespeare came the loud voice of joshua heyyy rockefeller bruce responded goodnaturedly funny you called me was going to call you tonight what bruce said in surprise but why did you leave me that note then what note the note you left under my wiper you hallucinating pal joshua said lightly didnt leave you any note what the hell are you talking about bruce said it said for me to call you when got home somebody playing trick on you trick bruce said blankly yeah trick prank you know but joshua sounded uneasy there uh was something wanted to talk to you about it pretty important too weird bruce muttered bruce listen to me all trace of bantering was gone from his voice now listen to me have some bad news for you what is it bruce asked nervously joshua spoke gently andrew colman died this morning of heart attack my cousin yes bruce could nt believe his ears andrew colman andy had been his best friend since they were three ever since andys mother bruce aunt by marriage had died bruce mother had spent lot of time with her brotherinlaw which meant that andy and bruce were left to play together lot andy was only two years older than bruce and they had been friends all through school until they went to different colleges still they had kept in touch until few months ago when andy had moved to england to hear that he had died left bruce with tremendous sense of loss andy is dead really sorry pal know what friend he was to you bruce was silent for moment he was only thirty thirtyone bruce the will reading is tonight it in california so do nt expect you to be there but they ll call me and let me know what you inherit okay yeah fine thanks sure if you need me ll be here until and at home after that okay bye bye bruce set down the receiver heavily and stared off into space it really was nt anyone fault that the communication had deteriorated but the mail often took two weeks at time to go from rhode island to england and phone calls were too expensive it had been business move and he had been due back after eighteen months andy had nt been in bruce thoughts much after the move but hearing he had died made bruce realize how much he had missed his cousin and how much more he would miss him now that he was gone numbly bruce got up and went into the kitchen for something to drink he opened up can of coke and drank some for lack of something better to do normally after school bruce would read or correct papers but it was friday and the day develop ments left him not really wanting to do work he decided to take walk instead he walked down the street where his house was heading for the shopping area nearby it was no fifth avenue just couple of short busy streets but it was the most urban area of his small neighborhood and he enjoyed walking around there people often glanced at bruce not because he was par ticularly strange but just that he was mostly different the neighborhood though small and cozyseeming was mostly full of conservative professionals who worked in providence but wanted to live in the suburbs it was the children of these yuppies who attended the school bruce worked at but bruce was different he did nt dress like an eccentric nor like slob nor like yuppie but just plain pair of pants unadorned with expensive labels and shirt much the same he stepped into small cozy icecream parlor and ordered double scoop of butter pecan he sat in white shiny metal chair the kind of chairs with flat red cushions that icecream parlors seemed to love although they grated on your backbone bruce ate his cone slowly looking around at the empty store he came into this place lot when nobody else was here although he ate lot of ice cream bruce was very trim and in good shape god only knew why since he never exercised after finishing his ice cream bruce got up and threw away the paper wrapper that had covered the cone the mirror caught his eye and he went over to check that he had no ice cream around the mouth for man of almost thirty bruce williams looked more like twenty his blond hair was short thick and fairly wavy his face was slightly square which made him look as if he had authority but with his classes forget it with high forehead dark hazel eyes the nose little big for his face and the mouth little small altogether he was not what you could call handsome exactly but he was goodlooking consoled with the thought that while some looked better than him others looked worse bruce left the parlor and headed for home short nonproductive walks reading and occasionally checking papers were the bulk of his afternoon horribly mundane except for his two drama classes which he really enjoyed the problem with those classes he reflected as he walked home was that nobody really cared it was to them an easy which was why as happened so often when rowdy or apa thetic students accused him of enjoying giving out bad grades too many times it was true he demanded the best he got mediocrity but what could you expect these were nt seasoned profes sionals they were kids hoping for good time there were few with real talent who actually hoped to get something out of the course but it was usually spoiled for them by the less enthusi astic kids oh well bruce thought as he jogged up the stairs to his house you ca nt expect the best all of the time you can only hope for the best some of the time entering the house suddenly gave bruce shock as it reminded him of what he had been trying to forget he glanced at his watch it had been quarter to two when he came home from school now it was quarter to three he wondered what time the will reading was how to spend the time it was question that plagued most of his evenings but when awaiting phone call the time passed so slow as to be tortuous he thought of calling joshua up but then decided against it joshua he knew would be all too happy to pause work and talk to him but bruce knew how busy the office was and did nt want to burden his friend with more work then bruce thought of ellie ellie fontaine was trig onometry teacher at the school very intelligent and very beautiful she and bruce had become excellent friends shortly after his arrival at the school two years ago more than just friends ran the studentfaculty grapevine but that was really all there was to it he looked up her number in the faculty phone book and dialed it hello this is ellie thanks for calling but came the sound of her recorded message bruce did nt really want to talk to her answering machine so he started to hang up then he heard andy herself oh damn it hang on sec bruce heard the tape speed up until it was incomprehensible then stop altogether hi bruce said hesitantly uh this is bruce bruce hi how are you andy said slightly out of breath sorry about that was upstairs and forgot to turn off the thing what up are you busy no not at all just wanted to talk to somebody his voice had note of desperation in it that he wished would go away what wrong why do you sound so upset did it show that much then thought struck him why are nt you at school why are you home always come home early on fridays she said patiently do nt have class the last period normally stay at school for assorted reasons but fridays just want to get home now what up bruce was about to tell her about andy but suddenly decided against it something come up probably wo nt be at the meeting tomorrow well that fine but why are you calling to tell me this bruce seriously now what wrong ellie had an infuriating way of knowing everybody too well bruce gave it up she was friend she would understand and tell nobody where was the point of keeping it from her andy colman my cousin died today your cousin oh so sorry to hear that were you close like brothers he had moved to england where guess he was pretty busy but bruce drew painful breath anyway that why may not be in school tomorrow understand when is the will reading taking place bruce sighed why was everyone so damned concerned about wills tonight in england somewhere ll know tonight what the share is if that really matters does it matter ellie used her patientteacherwitha disruptivestudent voice on him which annoyed him of course not why the hell should care what my best friend virtually the only relative had left me it ca nt be anything could nt live without so what the big deal whats the whole big deal bruce paused realizing he was shouting at ellie sorry that okay do nt mean to be taking this out on you you really do nt deserve it at all do nt worry about it she said kindly look better go did nt mean to call up and yell at you okay bruce ll cover for you tomorrow right you always do bruce said embarrassed take care okay really very sorry thanks goodbye ellie paused for second as though she were about to say something else but bye was all she said bruce hung up the receiver and put his head in his hands he felt like an incredible jackass he had called her up to make him feel better and wound up yelling at her just like an undusciplined child it was embarrassing and humiliating he sat like that for few minutes more and then suddenly sat up three oclock the reading was in england but it was later there six or seven hours later he picked up the phone and dialed joshua office this time joshua himself answered joshua monlleys office the aforementioned speaking joshua odd greeting made bruce smile in spite of himself hey rockefeller he said nervously hey shakespeare joshua replied what up how you doing okay okay thanks listen about the will reading know joshua interrupted did nt think about the time change either had other stuff on my mind bruce was only slightly surprised that joshua had known what bruce was thinking he was more surprised that joshua had forgotten the detail at all so what the deal bruce asked trying unsuccessfully to sound nonchalant well you know it odd joshua said quickly he uh did nt leave you money or bonds or any other kinds of assets oh no what he left you was books two books unusual books ones he acquired in england books that are worth lot of money they re very old and antique joshua do nt care about the money bruce felt the irritation returning but kept it under control right pal anyway there are the books and also two or three large envelopes envelopes yeah joshua said somewhat hesitantly just large yellow envelopes with your name on them and specific instructions for nobody to open them but you one of them appears to hold large coins the others just documents the books and the envelopes are on their way through overnight mail coins documents books what is this bruce asked puzzled any idea what it is joshua said curiously none at all ll just have to let you know right okay ll be in touch if anything else pops up thank you bye bye bruce said absently and slowly set down the re ceiver bruce spent the rest of the afternoon working on script he was writing in his spare time it was mystery play which kept getting more and more involved as he wrote it but it kept his mind off of andy until that night bruce was lying in bed unable to sleep the whole affair starting with the note bothered him seemed suspicious why should that note have been left joshua didnt leave it but he had needed to talk with bruce anyway if it was prank but the coincidence was too great somebody must have known but how and the inheritance andrew had owned several little objets dart sculptures paintings etc that had come from bruce home but were bequeathed to andy he andy had said many times that they ought to have been bruce as they had come from his house bruce however received the money those were what bruce expected from andy nothing of any practical financial worth they would never be sold by him just sent imental value but those books those envelopes what could they be andy was never huge reading fan and bruce could nt see what the big deal was with the books did andy expect bruce to sell them what about the coins that joshua had spoken about perhaps they too were worth something and the documents yes it all fit in now andrew had given to bruce some things which he could sell for himself to make lttle money it was thoughtful but bruce was little surprised by the imperson ality of the items it was nt like andy people change and with that bruce drifted off in the morning bruce head was clearer probably helped by the fact that it was indeed saturday and he had an excuse not to go to that damn meeting he lay in bed for while trying to fall asleep for few more minutes but the more he tried the more he woke up he got out of bed and went to the kitchen for some coffee glancing at the clock he was astonished to find that it was nearly tenthirty normally even on weekends bruce only slept until eightthirty or nine oclock psychological exhaustion he thought gulping down strongly caffeinated coffee that what needed to sleep off mental tiredness as he drained the cup he suddenly heard thunk outside his door shortly after the doorbell rang bruce glanced at himself in sweatpants and no shirt hang on he yelled running back to his bedroom to pull on tshirt he looked through the peephole there was man in federal express outfit with large white envelope under his arm bruce opened the door bruce williams said the man bruce nodded the man gave him the envelope and bent to pick up package at his feet ll do that bruce said sliding it across the threshold into the hall with his foot he dropped the envelope on top of it please sign this the courier gave bruce clipboard and bruce signed the receipt thank you the man tore off carbon copy handed it to bruce and left bruce closed the door picked up the envelope and balanced it on his arm lifted the package with his other arm and entered the kitchen dropping them on the table he got knife out of drawer and tore off the tape on the package it opened to reveal two books the books were remnants of what was once beautiful leatherbound goldstamped tomes whose bindings were worn and gilt had rubbed off the volumes had once been colored one in azure one in emerald now they were simply aged blue and green darkened by years of handling or shelflife or both bruce could make out the titles once traced golden now dull life in literature blue and world green bruce did nt open the envelope instead he picked up the blue book and leafed through it the print was large and written in sort of primitive italic font he sat down there and began to read the book was simply novel of one man life he lived in another world sort of fantasy world it was very complete in that it told much about every person connected with the man teague teague mother father friends teachers all were described in detail so as to give an excellent portrait of the man every person in that book was described carefully except one teague brother the book said no more than the fact that teague had brother it did nt even mention his name bruce found this odd but kept reading teague was friendly man who led simple life he was father and teacher of languages bruce wondered why book had been written about such lackluster man but nevertheless he enjoyed the book after he had finished the book and teague was dead and buried bruce lost no time in picking up the second book worlds he read through two or three pages before recognizing the writing style as almost identical to that of the first book he looked for an author but found no name the book seemed to be detailed description of the world that teague had lived in it was very factual and very real istic almost as if
