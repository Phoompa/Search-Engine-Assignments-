new land by vengeance it was glorious yet sad occasion unklack the barbarian had just defeated the evil wizard monster mage but in the process he had also slaughtered all of his fellow adventurers in berzerker attack upon the evil wizard that okay can always buy some more friends unklack thought translated from barbarian so he proceeded through the room which used to be the laboratory of monster mage but now it was in such wretched condition that it could be confused with poorly kept harpies nest unklack had been traveling for over two years now in search of the treasure of horace greely good friend and noble warrior but that didntt matter to unklack all he knew was that horace was dead and that he had left hoard of treasure for any brave adventurer to find and unklack was sure that he would find it as unklack proceded down narrow winding hall with countless spider webs and all other forms of sticky slimey trash he began to think translated again wonder if will ever find this marvelous treasure should nt have come to it by now and at that thought he entered room which was barren except for door which led out into forest and shimmering hole on the left side of the room that was so bright that it blinded unklack for an instant yaarrgghhh unklack screamed realizing that the door was an exit and not an entrance to treasure chamber which he had expected but what is that hole doing here unklack thought for many years unklack had despised magic and anything that resembled magic but in the past few years unklack had grown accustomed to it and even had few magical items in his possesion unklack walked over to the hole and peered into it and what he saw truly amazed him worldy as he was it another land unklack thought or it could be another trap set by the vanquished monster mage considered unklack well there was only one way to find out so unklack lowered himself down into the hole and instantly he vanished the next thing unklack saw was room which was pretty much barren except for few weird looking chairs table closed door and over on the left wall there was huge chest with rectangular glowing sections and on the sections there were strange glowing symbols whoooppeee cried unklack for he was sure that he had found the treasure now but how can open the chest unklack wondered then unklack had an idea which came very seldom for unklack he could use his helm of comprehending languages to figure out the riddle on the chest so he rummaged through his backpack and finaly found it he then put on the helm and stared at the symbols which read coke and deposit 50 cents what type of riddle is this screamed unklack and before he knew it he was hacking the chest up with his broadsword because this is what unklack usually does when he gets angry suddenly fluid started pouring out all over unklack and the floor and that was when he noticed the black snake which had come through hole in the wall and was probably eating his treasure arrgghh unklack arrgghhed and he charged forward and severed the snake in half with his sword the snake then fell to the wet floor and instantly unklack was paralyzed as hundreds of volts flowed through his body after about ten minutes of this unklack fell to dry part of the floor where he passed out when unklack awoke he was lying in bed and next to him was man with tubes coming out of his ears and this strange mutant had piece of cloth wrapped around unklacks arm which constricted every time the man squeezed his hand together fafadclearad unklack cursed as he tore the cloth snake from his arm unklack then lept out of bed and reached for his broadsword which was not there so he charged out of the room and behind him he heard the mutant yell security stop that man but this was just jibberish to unklack so he ploughed through the crowd of strange looking people in odd looking clothes until he reached the exit standing in front of the exit were two men one of which had club and the other had metal object which he pointed at unklack these peasants posed no problem for unklack so he charged through them and came to glass wall on top of the wall there was strange glowing red eye which glittered dangerously how can get through this unklack wondered because he had nothing with him except for his pants and his long cloak and unklack usually relied on his broadsword to get him out of trouble behind unklack one of the peasants cried stop or ill shoot unklack paid no attention to that obviously weak swine mainly because he could nt understand him and tried to think about plan to get past that magical eye suddenly unklack heard thunderbolt from behind him and instantly portion of the glass in front of him was shattered now this was just too much for unklack so he plunged through the glass and the instant he was about to hit it the glass moved making him fall head first on to the concrete yaarrr unklack screamed and he got up and turned around to find one of the guards rushing him with club now this is what unklack enjoys unklack ducked under the blow and picked up the guard and threw him at his other enemy with the thunder wand they both landed together in large heap and people inside the building were screaming and picking up some sort of handle and screaming into that as well well unklack had gotten frustrated now so he screamed yell of defience and ran into the busy street suddenly something caught unklacks eye it was huge golden at last thought unklack have found the treasure but before unklack could run for the golden tower large metal box with human inside smacked him up into the air and when he came down unklack fell face first on to the black soiless earth where he proceeded to make large crack on his head but there was no time for pain because unklack had finally found the treasure unklack slowly arose and hobbled over to the huge golden onlookers stared in disgust at the blood running down his face haernas quentos fesa meehanowack unlack said in triumph as he finaly arrived at the unklack then reached out and touched the which was made of some weird material which he had never before encountered aaarrrggghh cried unklack who was barely audible for he had realized that it wasntt gold unklack then slumped down next to the where he then allowed two odd looking people in white clothing to take him across the street and place him in his bed which he soiled with dirt and his blood unklack then felt his life slipping away and he noticed several people in white had crowded around him and one of them placed two small plates on his chest and pressed button which made his body fly up several inches into the air obviously they want to finish me off thought unklack but this was the last thought unklack had before all went dark sorry guys did nt think could save him said doctor arvenbaum as he pulled off his gloves hey why do nt we go get some sodas the end
