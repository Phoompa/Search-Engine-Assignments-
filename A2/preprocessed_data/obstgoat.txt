the obstinate goats once upon time two mountain goats happened to be going down the opposite slopes of valley through which flowed rushing river now some of the mountain dwellers had bridged the river by placing large tree trunk that had been struck by lightning to join the steep rocky banks the two goats met head on half way across the tree trunk for each wanted to cross to the other side but the trunk was not nearly wide enough for them to pass each other and neither goat was inclined to give way obstinately they began to bicker but neither would budge an inch words soon led to action and they started to fight till finally both tumbled off the tree trunk into the river below would nt it have been much simpler if only one of the goats had been courteous enough to allow the other to pass
