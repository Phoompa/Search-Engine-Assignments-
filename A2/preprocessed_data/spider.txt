the world fastest spider copyright 1991 andrew varga it was crisp autumn morning as slowly backed out of the driveway on my way to work having spent the night under our only tree gargantuan maple my car was heavily laden with multicolored red yellow and orange leaves had nt gone very far when thought noticed something move in strange way toward me across the cars hood not until it had surmounted my windshield did see that it was big ugly black spider hairy legs and all hate spiders and right then and there decided did nt need traveling companion that had eight hairy legs the spider had to go in an effort to persuade it to leave pushed the wiper button dopedope dopedope they went but that fat black creature hung on tenaciously well if ca nt shove it off said to myself ll wash it off and pushed another button the heavy spray of washer solution momentarily blurred the entire windshield some rude driver blasted his horn as we passed have reported him for disturbing the peace except that could nt see well enough to recognize the vehicle as my windshield cleared gaped in disbelief the spider was riding behind my wiper like water skier behind boat quickly swerved to the left and then to the right swear that big ugly sucker looked as though it was enjoying the ride its either him or me muttered and pushed down hard on the accelerator when hit sixty the wind blew two of its legs out from under it at seventy two more went by the time was doing eightyfive the spider was hanging on by only one leg just little more and you re history shouted triumphantly it was exactly then that heard the siren that old spider sat right there on my wiper and leered at me as waited at the side of the road for the policeman to walk up to the car do you know how fast you were going he asked me as he began writing out the ticket no sir do nt guiltily replied why were you speeding looked straight ahead my mind racing for plausible answer figured he would nt believe the real reason and ticket is preferable to breathalyzer test any time gasped in amazement the spider my evidence was gone sir are you all right the policeman asked ugh yes yes fine do nt know officer im usually very careful driver he handed me the ticket you can either pay this at the courthouse or you can send check to the department of motor vehicles at the state capital from now on slow down and drive carefully sat waiting as he returned to his car feeling foolish and muttering under my breath as soon as he leaves getting the tire iron from the trunk genuine smile bloomed across my face as watched the policeman turn off the flashers and slowly pull out around me it good thing he did nt look at me as he passed was laughing hysterically almost waved at my hairy nemesis perched there on top of his hat
