jack and the beanstalk once upon time there was poor widow who lived with her son jack in little house their wealth consisted solely of milking cow when the cow had grown too old the mother sent jack to sell it on his way to the market the boy met stranger will give you five magic beans for your cow the stranger offered jack was unsure and hesitated for while but then enticed by the idea of such an extraordinary deal he decided to accept when he returned home his mother was furious and reprimanded him sternly you fool what have you done we needed the money to buy calf now we do nt have anything and we are even poorer jack felt guilty and sad only fool would exchange cow for five beans his mother fumed then at the height of her exasperation she threw the five beans out of the window and sent jack to bed with no dinner the morning after when he stepped outside jack saw an amazing sight gigantic beanstalk reaching far into the clouds had grown overnight the beans must have really been magic jack thought happily being very curious the boy climbed the plant and once he reached the top of the stalk he found himself over the clouds while looking around in amazement jack saw huge castle of grey stone wonder who lives there he thought jack was very surprised to see path leading to the castle he cautiously stepped on the clouds and when he saw that they held him up he walked to the castle as he stood in front of the huge gate his curiosity increased he knocked several times on the gigantic door but no one came to open it jack noticed that the door was nt locked with great effort he was able to push it until it creaked open what are you doing here thundering voice asked the biggest woman he had ever seen was scowling at him jack could only mutter am lost may have something to eat am very hungry the woman who did not have children looked at him little more kindly come in quick will give you bowl of milk but be careful because my husband the ogre eats children if you hear him coming hide at once jack was shaking with fear but nonetheless he went inside the milk the woman gave him was very good and jack had almost finished drinking it when they heard tremendous noise the ogre was home fee fl fo fum smell the blood of an englishman the ogre shouted hide quick the woman whispered pushing jack into the oven do smell child in this room the ogre asked suspiciously snifflng and looking all around child the woman repeated you see and hear children everywhere that all you ever think about sit down and ll make your dinner the ogre still grumbling filled jug of wine and drank it all with his dinner after having counted again and again all the gold pleces of his treasure the ogre fell asleep with his feet propped up on the table after little while his thundering snoring echoed throughout the castle the ogre wife went to prepare the ogre bed and jack who had sneaked out ot the oven saw the gold pieces on the table and filled little bag full of them hope he wo nt see me otherwise he ll eat me whole jackq thought while shivering with fear jack heart was beating faster not just faster because he feared the ogre but because he was very excited thanks to all the gold coins he and his mother would be rich jack ran down the path over the clouds jack arrived at the top of the giant beanstalk and began to descend as quickly as possible hanging on the leaves and the branches when he finally reached the ground he found his mother waiting for him the poor woman had been worried sick since his disappearance she had been frightened by the giant beanstalk when she saw jack come down and then triumphantly hold up the bag full of gold she burst out crying where have you been my son do you want me to die worrying what kind of plant is this what jack cheerfully interrupted her emptying the contents of the bag before her you see did the right thing exchanglng that cow for the magic beans now ll tell you the whole story and jack told his mother everything that had happened in detail in the days that followed the widow humble house was made into comfortable home the gold pieces were spent to buy lot of things jack and his mother never had before mother and son were very happy but as time went by so did the money when the last gold piece had been spent jack decided to go back to the castle above the clouds this time the boy went inside through the kitchen and hid once again in the oven shortly after the ogre came in and began to sniff about smell children he said to his wife but since she had seen no one come in she did nt pay any attention to him after dinner the ogre placed hen on the table the hen laid golden eggs jack saw the miraculous hen from crack in the oven door he waited for the ogre to fall asleep jumped out of the oven snatched the hen and ran out of the castle the hen squawking however woke up the ogre thief thief he shouted but jack was already far away once again he found his mother anxiously waiting for him at the foot of the beanstalk is that all you stole hen she asked jack disappointed but jack ran happy to the courtyard just wait he said to his mother as matter of fact little while later the hen laid golden egg and continued to lay such an egg every single day after that by now jack and his mother were very wealthy their house was completely rebuilt teams of carpenters replaced the roof added new rooms and elegant marble columns then they bought paintings tapestries persian rugs mirrors and many other beautiful fumishings their miserable shack was transformed into luxurious home jack and his mother had not forgotten their previous years of poverty and deprivation so they chose to welcome any traveller who needed food or shelter but wealth does nt always bring happiness jack mother suddenly fell ill or so it seemed but not one of the many doctors who visited her could discover what her illness was the woman was sad ate less and less and showed no interest in life she rarely smiled and then only when jack was near to her her son tried to cheer her up but nothing could save the mother from her slow but inevitable decline even circus famous clown who had been invited especially for her entertainment received only sad greeting jack was desperate and did nt know what to do all the hen gold was not enough to make his mother well again so he had another idea what if went back to the ogre castle maybe there could find the answer he thought he shivered with fear thinking about the giant huge hands and mouth but the hope of helping his mother encouraged him to face the danger again one evening he gathered all his courage and climbed once more the giant beanstalk this time he entered the castle through an open window he sneaked in the darkness to the kitchen and hid inside huge pot until the following day after dinner the ogre went to get his magic harp an instrument that sang and played marvellous music while listening to the harp sweet melody the ogre fell asleep in his hiding place jack was captivated by the harp song as well when he finally heard the ogre snore loudly he lifted the pot lid and saw the extraordinary instrument golden harp he quickly climbed on the table and ran away with the harp in his hands the instrument woke up the ogre screaming master master wake up thief is taking me away the ogre woke up suddenly was disorientated for couple of seconds but then realized what was happening and began chasing jack the boy ran as fast as he could and the harp kept calling out shut up shut up if you ll play for me you ll be happier jack kept telling it breathlessly he finally arrived to where the leafy top of the beanstalk poked through the clouds jack crept along the ground and slipped down the stalk quietly the harp did not make sound and the ogre did nt see jack go down the plant when jack got down to earth he called to his mother look what ve brought you the harp began to play an enchanting melody and his mother smiled happlly but up there in the clouds someone else had heard the harp beautiful song and jack soon realized with terror that the thick beanstalk was shaking under very heavy weight the ogre was coming down to earth hide the harp and bring me an axe must chop down the plant before the ogre gets here jack said to his mother they could already see the ogre huge boots when the plant and the ogre finally crashed to the ground the ogre fell down cliff nearby the ogre wife never found out what had happened to her husband and as time passed jack no longer felt in danger the magical sound of the harp cured his mother sadness and she was once again happy and cheerful the hen kept on laying golden eggs jack life had gone through lot of changes since he had accepted the magic beans but without his courage and his wit he and his mother could never have found happiness
