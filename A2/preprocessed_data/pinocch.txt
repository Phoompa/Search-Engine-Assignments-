ppinocchio once upon time carpenter picked up strange lump of wood one day while mending table when he began to chip it the wood started to moan this frightened the carpenter and he decided to get rid of it at once so he gave it to friend called geppetto who wanted to make puppet geppetto cobbler took his lump of wood home thinking about the name he would give his puppet ll call him pinocchio he told himself it lucky name back in his humble basement home and workshop geppetto started to carve the wood suddenly voice squealed ooh that hurt geppeto was astonished to find that the wood was alive excitedly he carved head hair and eyes which immediately stared right at the cobbler but the second geppetto carved out the nose it grew longer and longer and no matter how often the cobbler cut it down to size it just stayed long nose the newly cut mouth began to chuckle and when geppetto angrily complained the puppet stuck out his tongue at him that was nothing however when the cobbler shaped the hands they snatched the good man wig and the newly carved legs gave him hearty kick his eyes brimming with tears geppetto scolded the puppet you naughty boy have nt even finished making you yet you ve no respect for your father then he picked up the puppet and step at time taught him to walk but the minute pinocchio stood upright he started to run about the room with geppetto after him then he opened the door and dashed into the street now pinocchio ran faster than geppetto and though the poor cobbler shouted stop him stop him none of the onlookers watching in amusement moved finger luckily policeman heard the cobbler shouts and strode quickly down the street grabbing the runaway he handed him over to his father ll box your ears gasped geppetto still out of breath then he realised that was impossible for in his haste to carve the puppet he had forgotten to make his ears pinocchio had got fright at being in the clutches of the police so he apologised and geppetto forgave his son indeed the minute they reached home the cobbler made pinocchio suit out of flowered paper pair of bark shoes and soft bread hat the puppet hugged his father like to go to school he said to become clever and help you when you re old geppetto was touched by this kind thought very grateful he replied but we have nt enough money even to buy you the first reading book pinocchio looked downcast then geppetto suddenly rose to his feet put on his old tweed coat and went out of the house not long after he returned carrying first reader but minus his coat it was snowing outside where your coat father sold it why did you sell it it kept me too warm pinocchio threw his arms round geppetto neck and kissed the kindly old man it had stopped snowing and pinocchio set out for school with his first reading book under his arm he was full of good intentions today want to learn to read tomorrow ll learn to write and the day after to count then ll earn some money and buy geppetto fine new coat he deserves it for the sudden sound of brass band broke into the puppet daydream and he soon forgot all about school he ended up in crowded square where people were clustering round brightly coloured booth what that he asked boy ca nt you read it the great puppet show how much do you pay to go inside fourpence who ll give me fourpence for this brand new book pinocchio cried nearby junk seller bought the reading book and pinocchio hurried into the booth poor geppetto his sacrifice had been quite in vain hardly had pinocchio got inside when he was seen by one of the puppets on the stage who cried out there pinocchio there pinocchio come along come up here with us hurrah for brother pinocchio cried the puppets pinocchio weent onstage with his new friends while the spectators below began to mutter about uproar then out strode giovanni the puppetmaster frightful looking man with fierce bloodshot eyes what going on here stop that noise get in line or you ll hear about it later that evening giovanni sat down to his meal but when he found that more wood was needed to finish cooking his nice chunk of meat he remembered the intruder who had upset his show come here pinocchio you ll make good firewood the poor puppet started to weep and plead save me father do nt want to die do nt want to die when giovanni heard pinocchio cries he was surprised are your parents still alive he asked my father is but ve never known my mother said the puppet in low voice the big man heart melted it would be beastly for your father if did throw you into the fire but must finish roasting the mutton ll just have to burn another puppet men bring me harlequin trussed when pinocchio saw that another puppet was going to be burned in his place he wept harder than ever please do nt sir oh sir please do nt do nt burn harlequin that enough boomed giovanni in rage want my meat well cooked in that case cried pinocchio defiantly rising to his feet burn me it not right that harlequin should be burnt instead of me giovanni was taken aback well well he said ve never met puppet hero before then he went on in milder tone you really are good lad might indeed hope flooded pinocchio heart as the puppetmaster stared at him then at last the man said all right ll eat halfraw mutton tonight but next time somebody will find himself in pickle all the puppets were delighted at being saved giovanni asked pinocchio to tell him the whole tale and feeling sorry for kindhearted geppetto he gave the puppet five gold pieces take these to your father he said tell him to buy himself new coat and give him my regards pinocchio cheerfully left the puppet booth after thanking giovanni for being so generous he was hurrying homewards when he met halfblind cat and lame fox he could nt help but tell them all about his good fortune and when the pair set eyes on the gold coins they hatched plot saying to pinocchio if you would really like to please your father you ought to take him lot more coins now we know of magic meadow where you can sow these five coins the next day you will find they have become ten times as many how can that happen asked pinocchio in amazement ll tell you how exclaimed the fox in the land of owls lies meadow known as miracle meadow if you plant one gold coin in little hole next day you will find whole tree dripping with gold coins pinocchio drank in every word his two friends uttered and off they all went to the red shrimp inn to drink to their meeting and future wealth after food and short rest they made plans to leave at midnight for miracle meadow however when pinocchio was wakened by the innkeeper at the time arranged he found that the fox and the cat had already left all the puppet could do then was pay for the dinner using one of his gold coins and set off alone along the path through the woods to the magic meadow suddenly your money or your life snarled two hooded bandits now pinocchio had hidden the coins under his tongue so he could not say word and nothing the bandits could do would make pinocchio tell where the coins were hidden still mute even when the wicked pair tied noose round the poor puppet neck and pulled it tighter and tighter pinocchio last thought was father help me of course the hooded bandits were the fox and the cat you ll hang there they said till you decide to talk we ll be back soon to see if you have changed your mind and away they went however fairy who lived nearby had overheard everything from the castle window the turquoise fairy saw kicking puppet dangling from an oak tree in the wood taking pity on him she clapped her hands three times and suddenly hawk and dog appeared quickly said the fairy to the hawk fly to that oak tree and with your beak snip away the rope round the poor lad neck to the dog she said fetch the carriage and gently bring him to me in no time at all pinocchio looking quite dead was lying in cosy bed in the castle while the fairy called three famous doctors crow owl and cricket very bitter medicine prescribed by these three doctors quickly cured the puppet then as she caressed him the fairy said tell me what happened pinocchio told her his story leaving out the bit about selling his first reading book but when the fairy asked him where the gold coins were the puppet replied that he had lost them in fact they were hidden in one of his pockets all at once pinocchio nose began to stretch while the fairy laughed you ve just told lie know you have because your nose is growing longer blushing with shame pinocchio had no idea what to do with such an ungainly nose and he began to weep however again feeling sorry for him the fairy clapped her hands and flock of woodpeckers appeared to peck his nose back to its proper length now do nt tell any more lies the fairy warned him or your nose will grow again go home and take these coins to your father pinocchio gratefully hugged the fairy and ran off homewards but near the oak tree in the forest he bumped into the cat and the fox breaking his promise he foolishly let himself be talked into burying the coins in the magic meadow full of hope he returned next day but the coins had gone pinocchio sadly trudged home without the coins giovanni had given him for his father after scolding the puppet for his long absence geppetto forgave him and off he went to school pinocchio seemed to have calmed down bit but someone else was about to cross his path and lead him astray this time it was carlo the lazy bones of the class why do nt you come to toyland with me he said nobody ever studies there and you can play all day long does such place really exist asked pinocchio in amazement the wagon comes by this evening to take me there said carlo would you like to come forgetting all his promises to his father and the fairy pinocchio was again heading for trouble midnight struck and the wagon arrived to pick up the two friends along with some other lads who could hardly wait to reach place where schoolbooks and teachers had never been heard of twelve pairs of donkeys pulled the wagon and they were all shod with white leather boots the boys clambered into the wagon pinocchio the most excited of them all jumped on to donkey toyland here we come now toyland was just as carlo had described it the boys all had great fun and there were no lessons you were nt even allowed to whisper the word school and pinocchio could hardly believe he was able to play all the time this is the life he said each time he met carlo was right was nt exclaimed his friend pleased with himself oh yes carlo thanks to you enjoying myself and just think teacher told me to keep well away from you one day however pinocchio awoke to nasty surprise when he raised hand to his head he found he had sprouted long pair of hairy ears in place of the sketchy ears that geppetto had never got round to finishing and that was nt all the next day they had grown longer than ever pinocchio shamefully pulled on large cotton cap and went off to search for carlo he too was wearing hat pulled right down to his nose with the same thought in their heads the boys stared at each other then snatching off their hats they began to laugh at the funny sight of long hairy ears but as they screamed with laughter carlo suddenly went pale and began to stagger pinocchio help help but pinocchio himself was stumbling about and he burst into tears for their faces were growing into the shape of donkey head and they felt themselves go down on all foursf pinocchio and carlo were turning into pair of donkeys and when they tried to groan with fear they brayed loudly instead when the toyland wagon driver heard the braying of his new donkeys he rubbed his hands in glee there are two fine new donkeys to take to market ll get at least four gold pieces for them for such was the awful fate that awaited naughty little boys that played truant from school to spend all their time playing games carlo was sold to farmer and circus man bought pinocchio to teach him to do tricks like his other performing animals it was hard life for donkey nothing to eat but hay and when that was gone nothing but straw and the beatings pinocchio was beaten every day till he had mastered the difficult circus tricks one day as he was jumping through the hoop he stumbled and went lame the circus man called the stable boy lame donkey is no use to me he said take it to market and get rid of it at any price but nobody wanted to buy useless donkey then along came little man who said ll take it for the skin it will make good drum for the village band and so for few pennies pinocchio changed hands and he brayed sorrowfully when he heard what his awful fate was to be the puppet new owner led him to the edge of the sea tied large stone to his neck and long rope round pinocchio legs and pushed hlm into the water clutching the end of the rope the man sat down to wait for pinocchio to drown then he would flay off the donkey skin pinocchio struggled for breath at the bottom of the sea and in flash remembered all the bother he had given geppetto his broken promises too and he called on the fairy the fairy heard pinocchio call and when she saw he was about to drown she sent shoal of big fish they ate away all the donkey flesh leaving the wooden pinocchio just then as the fish stopped nibbling pinocchio felt himself hauled out of the water and the man gaped in astonishment at the living puppet twisting and turning like an eel which appeared in place of the dead donkey when he recovered his wits he babbled almost in tears where the donkey threw into the sea that donkey giggled pinocchio you gasped the man do nt try pulling my leg if get angry however pinocchio told the man the whole story and that how you come to have live puppet on the end of the rope instead of dead donkey do nt give whit for your story shouted the man in rage all know is that paid twenty coins for you and want my money back since there no donkey ll take you to market and sell you as firewood by then free of the rope pinocchio made face at the man and dived into the sea thankful to be wooden puppet again pinocchio swam happily out to sea and was soon just dot on the horizon but his adventures were far from over out of the water behind him loomed terrible giant shark horrified pinocchio sawits wide open jaws and tried to swim away as fast as he could but the monster only glided closer then the puppet tried to escape by going in the other direction but in vain he could never escape the shark for as the water rushed into its cavernlike mouth he was sucked in with it and in an instant pinocchio had been swallowed along with shoals of fish unlucky enough to be in the fierce creature path down he went tossed in the torrent of water as it poured down the shark throat till he felt dizy when pinocchio came to his senses he was in darkness over his head he could hear the loud heave of the shark gills on his hands and knees the puppet crept down what felt like sloping path crying as he went help help wo nt anybody save me suddenly he noticed pale light and as he crept towards it he saw it was flame in the distance on he went till father it ca nt be you pinocchio son it really is you weeping for joy they hugged each other and between sobs told their adventures geppetto stroked the puppet head and told him how he came to be in the shark stomach was looking for you everywhere when could nt find you on dry land made boat to search for you on the sea but the boat capsized in storm then the shark gulped me down lucklly it also swallowed bits of ships wrecked in the tempest so ve managed to survive by gettlng what could from these well we re still alive remarked pinocchio when they had finished recounting their adventures we must get out of here taking geppetto hand the pair started to climb up the shark stomach using candle to light their way when they got as far as its jaws they took fright but as so happened this shark slept with its mouth open for it suffered from asthma as luck would have it the shark had been basking in shallow waters since the day before and pinocchio soon reached the beach dawn was just breaking and geppetto soaked to the skin was half dead with cold and fright lean on me father said pinocchio do nt know where we are but well soon find our way home beside the sands stood an old hut made of branches and there they took shelter geppetto was running temperature but pinocchio went out saying going to get you some milk the bleating of goats led the puppet in the right direction and he soon came upon farmer of course he had no money to pay for the milk my donkey dead said the farmer if you work the treadmill from dawn to noon then you can have some milk and so for days on end pinocchio rose early each morning to earn geppetto food at long last pinocchio and geppetto reached home the puppet worked late into the night weaving reed baskets to make money for his father and himself one day he heard that the fairy after wave of bad luck was ill in hospital so instead of buying himself new suit of clothes pinocchio sent the fairy the money to pay for her treatment one night in wonderful dream the fairy appeared to reward pinocchio for his kindness when the puppet looked in the mirror next morning he found he had turned into somebody else for there in the mirror was handsome young lad with blue eyes and brown hair geppetto hugged him happily where the old wooden pinocchio the young lad asked in astonishment there exclaimed geppetto pointing at him when bad boys become good their looks change along with their lives
