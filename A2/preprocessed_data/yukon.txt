soar in scorn as still as death as stern as fate the lonely sunsets flame and die the giant valleys gulp the night the monster mountains scrape the sky where eager stars are diamondbright so gaunt against the gibbous moon piercing the silence velvetpiled lone wolf howls his ancient rune the fell archspirit of the wild outcast land leper land let the lone wolfcry all express the hate insensate of thy hand thy heart abysmal loneliness contents the land god forgot the lonely sunsets flare forlorn the spell of the yukon wanted the gold and sought it the heart of the sourdough there where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon the three voices the waves have story to tell me the law of the yukon this is the law of the yukon and ever she makes it plain the parson son this is the song of the parson son as he squats in his shack alone the call of the wild have you gazed on naked grandeur where there nothing else to gaze on the lone trail ye who know the lone trail fain would follow it the pines we sleep in the sleep of ages the bleak barbarian pines the lure of little voices there cry from out the loneliness oh listen honey listen the song of the wageslave when the long long day is over and the big boss gives me my pay grin if you re up against bruiser and you re getting knocked about the shooting of dan mcgrew bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the malamute saloon the cremation of sam mcgee there are strange things done in the midnight sun my madonna haled me woman from the street unforgotten know garden where the lilies gleam the reckoning it fine to have blowout in fancy restaurant quatrains one said thy life is thine to make or mar the men that do nt fit in there race of men that do nt fit in music in the bush oer the dark pines she sees the silver moon the rhyme of the remittance man there fourpronged buck aswinging in the shadow of my cabin the lowdown white this is the payday up at the mines when the bearded brutes come down the little old log cabin when man gets on his uppers in hardpan sort of town the younger son if you leave the gloom of london and you seek glowing land the march of the dead the cruel war was over oh the triumph was so sweet fighting mac pistol shot rings round and round the world the woman and the angel an angel was tired of heaven as he lounged in the golden street the rhyme of the restless ones we could nt sit and study for the law new year eve it cruel cold on the waterfront silent and dark and drear comfort say you ve struck heap of trouble the harpy there was woman and she was wise woefully wise was she premonition was year ago and the moon was bright the tramps can you recall dear comrade when we tramped god land together lenvoi you who have lived in the land the spell of the yukon wanted the gold and sought it scrabbled and mucked like slave was it famine or scurvy fought it hurled my youth into grave wanted the gold and got it came out with fortune last fall yet somehow life not what thought it and somehow the gold is nt all no there the land have you seen it it the cussedest land that know from the big dizzy mountains that screen it to the deep deathlike valleys below some say god was tired when he made it some say it fine land to shun maybe but there some as would trade it for no land on earth and one you come to get rich damned good reason you feel like an exile at first you hate it like hell for season and then you are worse than the worst it grips you like some kinds of sinning it twists you from foe to friend it seems it been since the beginning it seems it will be to the end ve stood in some mightymouthed hollow that plumbfull of hush to the brim ve watched the big husky sun wallow in crimson and gold and grow dim till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming and the stars tumbled out neck and crop and ve thought that surely was dreaming with the peace the world piled on top the summer no sweeter was ever the sunshiny woods all athrill the grayling aleap in the river the bighorn asleep on the hill the strong life that never knows harness the wilds where the caribou call the freshness the freedom the farness god how stuck on it all the winter the brightness that blinds you the white land locked tight as drum the cold fear that follows and finds you the silence that bludgeons you dumb the snows that are older than history the woods where the weird shadows slant the stillness the moonlight the mystery ve bade em goodby but ca nt there land where the mountains are nameless and the rivers all run god knows where there are lives that are erring and aimless and deaths that just hang by hair there are hardships that nobody reckons there are valleys unpeopled and still there land oh it beckons and beckons and want to go back and will they re making my money diminish sick of the taste of champagne thank god when skinned to finish ll pike to the yukon again ll fight and you bet it no shamfight it hell but ve been there before and it better than this by damsite so me for the yukon once more there gold and it haunting and haunting it luring me on as of old yet it is nt the gold that wanting so much as just finding the gold it the great big broad land way up yonder it the forests where silence has lease it the beauty that thrills me with wonder it the stillness that fills me with peace the heart of the sourdough there where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon there where the sullen sundogs glare in the snowbright bitter noon and the glacierglutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of june there where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows there where the silences are spawned and the light of hellfire flows into the bowl of the midnight sky violet amber and rose there where the rapids churn and roar and the icefloes bellowing run where the tortured twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun ve packed my kit and going boys ere another day is done knew it would call or soon or late as it calls the whirring wings it the olden lure it the golden lure it the lure of the timeless things and tonight oh god of the trails untrod how it whines in my heartstrings sick to death of your wellgroomed gods your make believe and your show long for whiff of bacon and beans snug shakedown in the snow trail to break and life at stake and another bout with the foe with the rawribbed wild that abhors all life the wild that would crush and rend have clinched and closed with the naked north have learned to defy and defend shoulder to shoulder we have fought it out yet the wild must win in the end have flouted the wild have followed its lure fearless familiar alone by all that the battle means and makes claim that land for mine own yet the wild must win and day will come when shall be overthrown then when as wolfdogs fight we ve fought the lean wolfland and fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky even as lean wolfdog goes down will go down and die the three voices the waves have story to tell me as lie on the lonely beach chanting aloft in the pinetops the wind has lesson to teach but the stars sing an anthem of glory can not put into speech the waves tell of ocean spaces of hearts that are wild and brave of populous city places of desolate shores they lave of men who sally in quest of gold to sink in an ocean grave the wind is mighty roamer he bids me keep me free clean from the taint of the goldlust hardy and pure as he cling with my love to nature as child to the motherknee but the stars throng out in their glory and they sing of the god in man they sing of the mighty master of the loom his fingers span where star or soul is part of the whole and weft in the wondrous plan here by the campfire flicker deep in my blanket curled long for the peace of the pinegloom when the scroll of the lord is unfurled and the wind and the wave are silent and world is singing to world the law of the yukon this is the law of the yukon and ever she makes it plain send not your foolish and feeble send me your strong and your sane strong for the red rage of battle sane for harry them sore send me men girt for the combat men who are grit to the core swift as the panther in triumph fierce as the bear in defeat sired of bulldog parent steeled in the furnace heat send me the best of your breeding lend me your chosen ones them will take to my bosom them will call my sons them will gild with my treasure them will glut with my meat but the others the misfits the failures trample under my feet dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain ye would send me the spawn of your gutters go take back your spawn again wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway from my ruthless throne have ruled alone for million years and day hugging my mighty treasure waiting for man to come till he swept like turbid torrent and after him swept the scum the pallid pimp of the deadline the enervate of the pen one by one weeded them out for all that sought was men one by one dismayed them frighting them sore with my glooms one by one betrayed them unto my manifold dooms drowned them like rats in my rivers starved them like curs on my plains rotted the flesh that was left them poisoned the blood in their veins burst with my winter upon them searing forever their sight lashed them with funguswhite faces whimpering wild in the night staggering blind through the stormwhirl stumbling mad through the snow frozen stiff in the icepack brittle and bent like bow featureless formless forsaken scented by wolves in their flight left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white gnawing the black crust of failure searching the pit of despair crooking the toe in the trigger trying to patter prayer going outside with an escort raving with lips all afoam writing cheque for million driveling feebly of home lost like louse in the burning or else in the tented town seeking drunkard solace sinking and sinking down steeped in the slime at the bottom dead to decent world lost mid the human flotsam far on the frontier hurled in the camp at the bend of the river with its dozen saloons aglare its gambling dens ariot its gramophones all ablare crimped with the crimes of city sinridden and bridled with lies in the hush of my mountained vastness in the flush of my midnight skies plaguespots yet tools of my purpose so natheless suffer them thrive crushing my weak in their clutches that only my strong may survive but the others the men of my mettle the men who would stablish my fame unto its ultimate issue winning me honor not shame searching my uttermost valleys fighting each step as they go shooting the wrath of my rapids scaling my ramparts of snow ripping the guts of my mountains looting the beds of my creeks them will take to my bosom and speak as mother speaks am the land that listens am the land that broods steeped in eternal beauty crystalline waters and woods long have waited lonely shunned as thing accurst monstrous moody pathetic the last of the lands and the first visioning campfires at twilight sad with longing forlorn feeling my womb oerpregnant with the seed of cities unborn wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway and wait for the men who will win me and will not be won in day and will not be won by weaklings subtle suave and mild but by men with the hearts of vikings and the simple faith of child desperate strong and resistless unthrottled by fear or defeat them will gild with my treasure them will glut with my meat lofty stand from each sister land patient and wearily wise with the weight of world of sadness in my quiet passionless eyes dreaming alone of people dreaming alone of day when men shall not rape my riches and curse me and go away making bawd of my bounty fouling the hand that gave till rise in my wrath and sweep on their path and stamp them into grave dreaming of men who will bless me of women esteeming me good of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood of cities leaping to stature of fame like flag unfurled as pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world this is the law of the yukon that only the strong shall thrive that surely the weak shall perish and only the fit survive dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain this is the will of the yukon lo how she makes it plain the parson son this is the song of the parson son as he squats in his shack alone on the wild weird nights when the northern lights shoot up from the frozen zone and it sixty below and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan one of the arctic brotherhood an oldtime pioneer came with the first god how ve cursed this yukon but still here ve sweated athirst in its summer heat ve frozen and starved in its cold ve followed my dreams by its thousand streams ve toiled and moiled for its gold look at my eyes been snowblind twice look where my foot half gone and that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frostfiend bit to the bone each one brand of this devil land where ve played and ve lost the game broken wreck with craze for hooch and never cent to my name this mining is only gamble the worst is as good as the best was in with the bunch and might have come out right on top with the rest with cormack ladue and macdonald god but it hell to think of the thousands and thousands ve squandered on cards and women and drink in the early days we were just few and we hunted and fished around nor dreamt by our lonely campfires of the wealth that lay under the ground we traded in skins and whiskey and ve often slept under the shade of that lone birch tree on bonanza where the first big find was made we were just like great big family and every man had his squaw and we lived such wild free fearless life beyond the pale of the law till sudden there came whisper and it maddened us every man and got in on bonanza before the big rush began oh those dawson days and the sin and the blaze and the town all open wide if god made me in his likeness sure he let the devil inside but we were all mad both the good and the bad and as for the women well no spot on the map in so short space has hustled more souls to hell money was just like dirt there easy to get and to spend was all caked in on dancehall jade but she shook me in the end it put me queer and for near year never drew sober breath till found myself in the bughouse ward with claim staked out on death twenty years in the yukon struggling along its creeks roaming its giant valleys scaling its godlike peaks bathed in its fiery sunsets fighting its fiendish cold twenty years in the yukon twenty years and old old and weak but no matter there hooch in the bottle still ll hitch up the dogs tomorrow and mush down the trail to bill it so long dark and lonesome ll just lay down on the bed tomorrow ll go tomorrow guess ll play on the red come kit your pony is saddled waiting dear in the court minnie you devil ll kill you if you skip with that flossy sport how much does it go to the pan bill play up school and play the game our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name this was the song of the parson son as he lay in his bunk alone ere the fire went out and the cold crept in and his blue lips ceased to moan and the hungermaddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone the call of the wild have you gazed on naked grandeur where there nothing else to gaze on set pieces and dropcurtain scenes galore big mountains heaved to heaven which the blinding sunsets blazon black canyons where the rapids rip and roar have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking through it searched the vastness for something you have lost have you strung your soul to silence then for god sake go and do it hear the challenge learn the lesson pay the cost have you wandered in the wilderness the sagebrush desolation the bunchgrass levels where the cattle graze have you whistled bits of ragtime at the end of all creation and learned to know the desert little ways have you camped upon the foothills have you galloped oer the ranges have you roamed the arid sunlands through and through have you chummed up with the mesa do you know its moods and changes then listen to the wild it calling you have you known the great white silence not snowgemmed twig aquiver eternal truths that shame our soothing lies have you broken trail on snowshoes mushed your huskies up the river dared the unknown led the way and clutched the prize have you marked the map void spaces mingled with the mongrel races felt the savage strength of brute in every thew and though grim as hell the worst is can you round it off with curses then hearken to the wild it wanting you have you suffered starved and triumphed groveled down yet grasped at glory grown bigger in the bigness of the whole done things just for the doing letting babblers tell the story seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul have you seen god in his splendors heard the text that nature renders you ll never hear it in the family pew the simple things the true things the silent men who do things then listen to the wild it calling you they have cradled you in custom they have primed you with their preaching they have soaked you in convention through and through they have put you in showcase you re credit to their teaching but ca nt you hear the wild it calling you let us probe the silent places let us seek what luck betide us let us journey to lonely land know there whisper on the nightwind there star agleam to guide us and the wild is calling calling let us go the lone trail ye who know the lone trail fain would follow it though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit ye who take the lone trail bid your love goodby the lone trail the lone trail follow till you die the trails of the world be countless and most of the trails be tried you tread on the heels of the many till you come where the ways divide and one lies safe in the sunlight and the other is dreary and wan yet you look aslant at the lone trail and the lone trail lures you on and somehow you re sick of the highway with its noise and its easy needs and you seek the risk of the byway and you reck not where it leads and sometimes it leads to the desert and the tongue swells out of the mouth and you stagger blind to the mirage to die in the mocking drouth and sometimes it leads to the mountain to the light of the lone campfire and you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hungergoaded desire and sometimes it leads to the southland to the swamp where the orchid glows and you rave to your grave with the fever and they rob the corpse for its clothes and sometimes it leads to the northland and the scurvy softens your bones and your flesh dints in like putty and you spit out your teeth like stones and sometimes it leads to coral reef in the wash of weedy sea and you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily and sometimes it leads to an arctic trail and the snows where your torn feet freeze and you whittle away the useless clay and crawl on your hands and knees often it leads to the deadpit always it leads to pain by the bones of your brothers ye know it but oh to follow you re fain by your bones they will follow behind you till the ways of the world are made plain bid goodby to sweetheart bid goodby to friend the lone trail the lone trail follow to the end tarry not and fear not chosen of the true lover of the lone trail the lone trail waits for you the pines we sleep in the sleep of ages the bleak barbarian pines the gray moss drapes us like sages and closer we lock our lines and deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never sunbeam shines on the flanks of the stormgored ridges are our black battalions massed we surge in host to the sullen coast and we sing in the ocean blast from empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast to the niggard lands were we driven twixt desert and floes are we penned to us was the northland given ours to stronghold and defend ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end ours from the bleak beginning through the aeons of deathlike sleep ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing deep ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier creep wind of the east wind of the west wandering to and fro chant your songs in our topmost boughs that the sons of men may know the peerless pine was the first to come and the pine will be last to go we pillar the halls of perfumed gloom we plume where the eagles soar the northwind swoops from the brooding pole and our ancients crash and roar but where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up hardy score we spring from the gloom of the canyon womb in the valley lap we lie from the white foamfringe where the breakers cringe to the peaks that tusk the sky we climb and we peer in the craglocked mere that gleams like golden eye gain to the verge of the hogback ridge where the vision ranges free pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery sun moon and stars give answer shall we not staunchly stand even as now forever wards of the wilder strand sentinels of the stillness lords of the last lone land the lure of little voices there cry from out the loneliness oh listen honey listen do you hear it do you fear it you re aholding of me so you re asobbing in your sleep dear and your lashes how they glisten do you hear the little voices all abegging me to go all abegging me to leave you day and night they re pleading praying on the northwind on the westwind from the peak and from the plain night and day they never leave me do you know what they are saying he was ours before you got him and we want him once again yes they re wanting me they re haunting me the awful lonely places they re whining and they re whimpering as if each had soul they re calling from the wilderness the vast and godlike spaces the stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the pole they miss my little campfires ever brightly bravely gleaming in the womb of desolation where was never man before as comradeless sought them lionhearted loving dreaming and they hailed me as comrade and they loved me evermore and now they re all acrying and it no use me denying the spell of them is on me and helpless as child my heart is aching aching but hear them sleeping waking it the lure of little voices it the mandate of the wild afraid to tell you honey can take no bitter leaving but softly in the sleeptime from your love ll steal away oh it cruel dearie cruel and it god knows how grieving but his loneliness is calling and he knows must obey the song of the wageslave when the long long day is over and the big boss gives me my pay hope that it wo nt be hellfire as some of the parsons say and hope that it wo nt be heaven with some of the parsons ve met all want is just quiet just to rest and forget look at my face toilfurrowed look at my calloused hands master ve done thy bidding wrought in thy many lands wrought for the little masters bigbellied they be and rich ve done their desire for daily hire and die like dog in ditch have used the strength thou hast given thou knowest did not shirk threescore years of labor thine be the long day work and now big master broken and bent and twisted and scarred but ve held my job and thou knowest and thou will not judge me hard thou knowest my sins are many and often ve played the fool whiskey and cards and women they made me the devil tool was just like child with money flung it away with curse feasting fawning parasite or glutting harlot purse then back to the woods repentant back to the mill or the mine the worker of workers everything in my line everything hard but headwork no more brains than kid brute with brute strength to labor doing as was bid living in camps with menfolk lonely and loveless life never knew kiss of sweetheart never caress of wife brute with brute strength to labor and they were so far above yet gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of love with the strength to two men savage and shy and wild yet how ha treasured woman and the sweet warm kiss of child well is thy world and thou knowest blaspheme and my ways be rude but ve lived my life as found it and ve done my best to be good the primitive toiler half naked and grimed to the eyes sweating it deep in their ditches swining it stark in their styes hurling down forests before me spanning tumultuous streams down in the ditch building oer me palaces fairer than dreams boring the rock to the orebed driving the road through the fen resolute dumb uncomplaining man in world of men master ve filled my contract wrought in thy many lands not by my sins wilt thou judge me but by the work of my hands master ve done thy bidding and the light is low in the west and the long long shift is over master ve earned it rest grin if you re up against bruiser and you re getting knocked about grin if you re feeling pretty groggy and you re licked beyond doubt grin do nt let him see you re funking let him know with every clout though your face is battered to pulp your blooming heart is stout just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out and grin this life bally battle and the same advice holds true of grin if you re up against it badly then it only one on you so grin if the future black as thunder do nt let people see you re blue just cultivate castiron smile of joy the whole day through if they call you little sunshine wish that they no troubles too you may grin rise up in the morning with the will that smooth or rough you ll grin sink to sleep at midnight and although you re feeling tough yet grin there nothing gained by whining and you re not that kind of stuff you re fighter from away back and you wo nt take rebuff your trouble is that you do nt know when you have had enough do nt give in if fate should down you just get up and take another cuff you may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff and grin the shooting of dan mcgrew bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the malamute saloon the kid that handles the musicbox was hitting jagtime tune back of the bar in solo game sat dangerous dan mcgrew and watching his luck was his lightolove the lady that known as lou when out of the night which was fifty below and into the din and the glare there stumbled miner fresh from the creeks dogdirty and loaded for bear he looked like man with foot in the grave and scarcely the strength of louse yet he tilted poke of dust on the bar and he called for drinks for the house there was none could place the stranger face though we searched ourselves for clue but we drank his health and the last to drink was dangerous dan mcgrew there men that somehow just grip your eyes and hold them hard like spell and such was he and he looked to me like man who had lived in hell with face most hair and the dreary stare of dog whose day is done as he watered the green stuff in his glass and the drops fell one by one then got to figgering who he was and wondering what he do and turned my head and there watching him was the lady that known as lou his eyes went rubbering round the room and he seemed in kind of daze till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze the ragtime kid was having drink there was no one else on the stool so the stranger stumbles across the room and flops down there like fool in buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and saw him sway then he clutched the keys with his talon hands my god but that man could play were you ever out in the great alone when the moon was awful clear and the icy mountains hemmed you in with silence you most could hear with only the howl of timber wolf and you camped there in the cold halfdead thing in stark dead world clean mad for the muck called gold while high overhead green yellow and red the north lights swept in bars then you ve haunch what the music meant hunger and night and the stars and hunger not of the belly kind that banished with bacon and beans but the gnawing hunger of lonely men for home and all that it means for fireside far from the cares that are four walls and roof above but oh so cramful of cosy joy and crowned with woman love woman dearer than all the world and true as heaven is true god how ghastly she looks through her rouge the lady that known as lou then on sudden the music changed so soft that you scarce could hear but you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it once held dear that someone had stolen the woman you loved that her love was devil lie that your guts were gone and the best for you was to crawl away and die was the crowning cry of heart despair and it thrilled you through and through guess ll make it spread misere said dangerous dan mcgrew the music almost died away then it burst like pentup flood and it seemed to say repay repay and my eyes were blind with blood the thought came back of an ancient wrong and it stung like frozen lash and the lust awoke to kill to kill then the music stopped with crash and the stranger turned and his eyes they burned in most peculiar way in buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and saw him sway then his lips went in in kind of grin and he spoke and his voice was calm and boys says he you do nt know me and none of you care damn but want to state and my words are straight and ll bet my poke they re true that one of you is hound of hell and that one is dan mcgrew then ducked my head and the lights went out and two guns blazed in the dark and woman screamed and the lights went up and two men lay stiff and stark pitched on his head and pumped full of lead was dangerous dan mcgrew while the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady that known as lou these are the simple facts of the case and guess ought to know they say the stranger was crazed with hooch and not denying it so not so wise as the lawyer guys but strictly between us two the woman that kissed him and pinched his poke was the lady that known as lou the cremation of sam mcgee there are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold the arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold the northern lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see was that night on the marge of lake lebarge cremated sam mcgee now sam mcgee was from tennessee where the cotton blooms and blows why he left his home in the south to roam round the pole god only knows he was always cold but the land of gold seemed to hold him like spell though he often say in his homely way that he sooner live in hell on christmas day we were mushing our way over the dawson trail talk of your cold through the parka fold it stabbed like driven nail if our eyes we close then the lashes froze till sometimes we could nt see it was nt much fun but the only one to whimper was sam mcgee and that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow and the dogs were fed and the stars oerhead were dancing heel and toe he turned to me and cap says he ll cash in this trip guess and if do asking that you wo nt refuse my last request well he seemed so low that could nt say no then he says with sort of moan it the cursed cold and it got right hold till chilled clean through to the bone yet tai nt being dead it my awful dread of the icy grave that pains so want you to swear that foul or fair you ll cremate my last remains pal last need is thing to heed so swore would not fail and we started on at the streak of dawn but god he looked ghastly pale he crouched on the sleigh and he raved all day of his home in tennessee and before nightfall corpse was all that was left of sam mcgee there was nt breath in that land of death and hurried horrordriven with corpse half hid that could nt get rid because of promise given it was lashed to the sleigh and it seemed to say you may tax your brawn and brains but you promised true and it up to you to cremate those last remains now promise made is debt unpaid and the trail has its own stern code in the days to come though my lips were dumb in my heart how cursed that load in the long long night by the lone firelight while the huskies round in ring howled out their woes to the homeless snows god how loathed the thing and every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow and on went though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low the trail was bad and felt half mad but swore would not give in and often sing to the hateful thing and it hearkened with grin till came to the marge of lake lebarge and derelict there lay it was jammed in the ice but saw in trice it was called the alice may and looked at it and thought bit and looked at my frozen chum then here said with sudden cry is my crematoreum some planks tore from the cabin floor and lit the boiler fire some coal found that was lying around and heaped the fuel higher the flames just soared and the furnace roared such blaze you seldom see and burrowed hole in the glowing coal and stuffed in sam mcgee then made hike for did nt like to hear him sizzle so and the heavens scowled and the huskies howled and the wind began to blow it was icy cold but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks and do nt know why and the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky do not know how long in the snow wrestled with grisly fear but the stars came out and they danced about ere again ventured near was sick with dread but bravely said ll just take peep inside guess he cooked and it time looked then the door opened wide and there sat sam looking cool and calm in the heart of the furnace roar and he wore smile you could see mile and he said please close that door it fine in here but greatly fear you ll let in the cold and storm since left plumtree down in tennessee it the first time ve been warm there are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold the arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold the northern lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see was that night on the marge of lake lebarge cremated sam mcgee my madonna haled me woman from the street shameless but oh so fair bade her sit in the model seat and painted her sitting there hid all trace of her heart unclean painted babe at her breast painted her as she might have been if the worst had been the best she laughed at my picture and went away then came with knowing nod connoisseur and heard him say is mary the mother of god so painted halo round her hair and sold her and took my fee and she hangs in the church of saint hillaire where you and all may see unforgotten know garden where the lilies gleam and one who lingers in the sunshine there she is than whitestoled lily far more fair and oh her eyes are heavenlit with dream know garret cold and dark and drear and one who toils and toils with tireless pen until his brave sad eyes grow weary then he seeks the stars pale silent as seer and ah it strange for desolate and dim between these two there rolls an ocean wide yet he is in the garden by her side and she is in the garret there with him the reckoning it fine to have blowout in fancy restaurant with terrapin and canvasback and all the wine you want to enjoy the flowers and music watch the pretty women pass smoke choice cigar and sip the wealthy water in your glass it bully in hightoned joint to eat and drink your fill but it quite another matter when you pay the bill it great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent to wear your glad rags always and to never save cent to drift along regardless have good time every trip to hit the high spots sometimes and to let your chances slip to know you re acting foolish yet to go on fooling still till nature calls showdown and you pay the bill time has got little bill get wise while yet you may for the debit side increasing in most alarming way the things you had no right to do the things you should have done they re all put down it up to you to pay for every one so eat drink and be merry have good time if you will but god help you when the time comes and you

the song where spheral voices blend there no beginning never will be end it makes us nutty hang the astral chimes the tables spread come let us dine my friend the men that do nt fit in there race of men that do nt fit in race that ca nt stay still so they break the hearts of kith and kin and they roam the world at will they range the field and they rove the flood and they climb the mountain crest theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood and they do nt know how to rest if they just went straight they might go far they are strong and brave and true but they re always tired of the things that are and they want the strange and new they say could find my proper groove what deep mark would make so they chop and change and each fresh move is only fresh mistake and each forgets as he strips and runs with brilliant fitful pace it the steady quiet plodding ones who win in the lifelong race and each forgets that his youth has fled forgets that his prime is past till he stands one day with hope

tremulous star and soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune of cowbells jangled in the fields afar quite listless for her daily stent is done she stands sad exile at her rosewreathed door and sends her love eternal with the sun that goes to gild the land she ll see no more the grave gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze all still the sky and darkling drearily she feels the chilly breath of dear dead days come sifting through the alders eerily oh how the roses riot in their bloom the curtains stir as with an ancient pain her old piano gleams from out the gloom and waits and waits her tender touch in vain but now her hands like moonlight brush the keys with velvet grace melodious delight and now sad refrain from over seas goes sobbing on the bosom of the night and now she sings singer in the gloom voicing sorrow we can neer express here in the farness where we few have room unshamed to show our love and tenderness our hearts will echo till they beat no more that song of sadness and of motherland and stretched in deathless love to england shore some day she ll hearken and she ll understand primadonna in the shining past but now mother growing old and gray she thinks of how she held people fast in thrall and gleaned the triumphs of day she sees sea of faces like dream she sees herself queen of song once more she sees lips part in rapture eyes agleam she sings as never once she sang before she sings wild sweet song that throbs with pain the added pain of life that transcends art song of home deep celestial strain the glorious swansong of dying heart lame tramp comes along the railway track grizzled dog whose day is nearly done he passes pauses then comes slowly back and listens there an audience of one she sings her golden voice is passionfraught as when she charmed thousand eager ears he listens trembling and she knows it not and down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears she ceases and is still as if to pray there is no sound the stars are all alight only wretch who stumbles on his way only vagrant sobbing in the night the rhyme of the remittance man there fourpronged buck aswinging in the shadow of my cabin and it roamed the velvet valley till today but tracked it by the river and trailed it in the cover and killed it on the mountain miles away now ve had my lazy supper and the level sun is gleaming on the water where the silver salmon play and light my little corncob and linger softly dreaming in the twilight of land that far away far away so faint and far is flaming london fevered paris that fancy have gained another star far away the din and hurry far away the sin and worry far away god knows they can not be too far gilded galleyslaves of mammon how my purseproud brothers taunt me might have been as welltodo as they had clutched like them my chances learned their wisdom crushed my fancies starved my soul and gone to business every day well the cherry bends with blossom and the vivid grass is springing and the starlike lily nestles in the green and the frogs their joys are singing and my heart in tune is ringing and it does nt matter what might have been while above the scented pinegloom piling heights of golden glory the sungod paints his canvas in the west can couch me deep in clover can listen to the story of the lazy lapping water it is best while the trout leaps in the river and the blue grouse thrills the cover and the frozen snow betrays the panther track and the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of lover am happy and ll nevermore go back for know just be longing for the little old log cabin with the morningglory clinging to the door till loathed the city places cursed the care on all the faces turned my back on lazar london evermore so send me far from lombard street and write me down failure put little in my purse and leave me free say he turned from fortune offering to follow up pale lure he is one of us no longer let him be am one of you no longer by the trails my feet have broken the dizzy

bearded brutes come down there money to burn in the streets tonight so ve sent my klooch to town with haggard face and ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown and know at the dawn she ll come reeling home with the bottles one two three one for herself to drown her shame and two big bottles for me to make me forget the thing am and the man used to be to make me forget the brand of the dog as crouch in this hideous place to make me forget once kindled the light of love in lady face where even the squalid siwash now holds me black disgrace oh have guarded my secret well and who would dream as speak in tribal tongue like rogue unhung mid the ranchhouse filth and reek could roll to bed with latin phrase and rise with verse of greek yet was senior prizeman once and the pride of college eight called to the bar my friends were true but they could not keep me straight then came the divorce and went abroad and died on the river plate but not dead yet though with half lung there is nt time to spare and hope that the year will see me out and thank god no one will care save maybe the little slim siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair she will come with the dawn and the dawn is near can see its evil glow like corpselight seen through frosty pane in night of want and woe and yonder she comes by the bleak bullpines swift staggering through the snow the little old log

and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand and greet you with welcome warm and true for he your younger brother the one you sent away because there was nt room for him at home and now he quite contented and he glad he did nt stay and he building britain greatness oer the foam when the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun and the prairie is lit with rose and gold and the camp is all abustle and the busy day begun he leaps into the saddle sure and bold through the round of heat and hurry through the racket and the rout he rattles at pace that nothing mars and when the nightwinds whisper and campfires flicker out he is sleeping like child beneath the stars when the wattleblooms are drooping in the sombre shedoak glade and the breathless land is lying in swoon he leaves his work moment leaning lightly on his spade and he hears the bellbird chime the austral noon the parrakeets are silent in the gumtree by the creek the ferny grove is sunshinesteeped and still but the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek his little lonely cabin on the hill around the purple vineclad slope the argent river dreams the roses almost hide the house from view snowpeak of the winterberg in crimson splendor gleams the shadow deepens down on the karroo he seeks the lilyscented dusk beneath the orange tree his pipe in silence glows and fades and glows and then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee and one is like the lily one the rose he sees his white sheep dapple oer the green new zealand plain and where vancouver shaggy ramparts frown when the sunlight threads the pinegloom he is fighting might and main to clinch the rivets of an empire down you will find him toiling toiling in the south or in the west child of nature fearless frank and free and the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast and he sends you loyal greeting oer the sea you ve brother in the army you ve another in the church one of you is diplomatic swell you ve had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch and yet think he doing very well sure his life is happy and he does nt envy yours know he loves the land his pluck has won and fancy in the years unborn while england fame endures she will come to bless with pride the younger son the march of the dead the cruel war was over oh the triumph was so sweet we watched the troops returning through our tears there was triumph triumph triumph down the scarlet glittering street and you scarce could hear the music for the cheers and you scarce could see the housetops for the flags that flew between the bells were pealing madly to the sky and everyone was shouting for the soldiers of the queen and the glory of an age was passing by and then there came shadow swift and sudden dark and drear the bells were silent not an echo stirred the flags were drooping sullenly the men forgot to cheer we waited and we never spoke word the sky grew darker darker till from out the gloomy rack there came voice that checked the heart with dread tear down tear down your bunting now and hang up sable black they are coming it the army of the dead they were coming they were coming gaunt and ghastly sad and slow they were coming all the crimson wrecks of pride with faces seared and cheeks red smeared and haunting eyes of woe and clotted holes the khaki could nt hide oh the clammy brow of anguish the livid foamflecked lips the reeling ranks of ruin swept along the limb that trailed the hand that failed the bloody finger tips and oh the dreary rhythm of their song they left us on the veldtside but we felt we could nt stop on this our england crowning festal day we re the men of magersfontein we re the men of spion kop colenso we re the men who had to pay we re the men who paid the bloodprice shall the grave be all our gain you owe us long and heavy is the score then cheer us for our glory now and cheer us for our pain and cheer us as ye never cheered before the folks were white and stricken and each tongue seemed weighted with lead each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice and every eye was staring at the horror of the dead the pity of the men who paid the price they were come were come to mock us in the first flush of our peace through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam they were coming in their thousands oh would they never cease closed my eyes and then it was dream there was triumph triumph triumph down the scarlet gleaming street the town was mad man was like boy thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet thousand bells were thundering the joy there was music mirth and sunshine but some eyes shone with regret and while we stun with cheers our homing braves god in thy great mercy let us nevermore forget the graves they left behind the bitter graves fighting mac life tragedy pistol shot rings round and round the world in pitiful defeat warrior lies last defiance to dark death is hurled last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies alone he falls with wide wan woeful eyes eyes that could smile at death could not face shame alone alone he paced his narrow room in the bright sunshine of that paris day saw in his thought the awful hand of doom saw in his dream his glory pass away tried in his heart his weary heart to pray god who made me give me strength to face the spectre of this bitter black disgrace the burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen the beekissed heather blooms around the door he sees himself barefoot boy again bending oer page of legendary lore he hears the pibroch grips the red claymore runs with the fiery cross clansman true sworn kinsman of rob roy and roderick dhu eating his heart out with wild desire one day behind his counter trim and neat he hears sound that sets his brain afire the highlanders are marching down the street oh how the pipes shrill out the mad drums beat on to the gates of hell my gordons gay he flings his hated yardstick away he sees the sullen pass highcrowned with snow where afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate he hurls himself against the hidden foe they try to rally ah too late too late again defenseless with fierce eyes that wait for death he stands like baited bull at bay and flouts the boers that mad majuba day he sees again the murderous soudan bloodslaked and rapineswept he seems to stand upon the gory plain of omdurman then magersfontein and supreme command over his highlanders to shake his hand king is proud and princes call him friend and glory crowns his life and now the end the awful end his eyes are dark with doom he hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead he sees the ravaged ranks the flamestabbed gloom oh to have fallen the battlefield his bed with wauchope and his glorious brotherdead why was he saved for this for this and now he raises the revolver to his brow in many highland home framed with rude art you ll find his portrait roughhewn stern and square it graven in the fuyam fellah heart the ghurka reads it at his evening prayer the raw lands know it where the fierce suns glare the dervish fears it honor to his name who holds aloft the shield of england fame mourn for our hero men of northern race we do not know his sin we only know his sword was keen he laughed death in the face and struck for empire sake giant blow his arm was strong ah well they learnt the foe the echo of his deeds is ringing yet will ring for aye all else let us forget the woman and the angel an angel was tired of heaven as he lounged in the golden street his halo was tilted sideways and his harp lay mute at his feet so the master stooped in his pity and gave him pass to go for the space of moon to the earthworld to mix with the men below he doffed his celestial garments scarce waiting to lay them straight he bade good by to peter who stood by the golden gate the sexless singers of heaven chanted fond farewell and the imps looked up as they pattered on the redhot flags of hell never was seen such an angel eyes of heavenly blue features that shamed apollo hair of golden hue the women simply adored him his lips were like cupid bow but he never ventured to use them and so they voted him slow till at last there came one woman marvel of loveliness and she whispered to him do you love me and he answered that woman yes and she said put your arms around me and kiss me and hold me so but fiercely he drew back saying this thing is wrong and know then sweetly she mocked his scruples and softly she him beguiled you who are verily man among men speak with the tongue of child we have outlived the old standards we have burst like an overtight thong the ancient outworn puritanic traditions of right and wrong then the master feared for his angel and called him again to his side for oh the woman was wondrous and oh the angel was tried and deep in his hell sang the devil and this was the strain of his song the ancient outworn puritanic traditions of right and wrong the rhyme of the restless ones we could nt sit and study for the law the stagnation of bank we could nt stand for our riot blood was surging and we did nt need much urging to excitements and excesses that are banned so we took to wine and drink and other things and the devil in us struggled to be free till our friends rose up in wrath and they pointed out the path and they paid our debts and packed us oer the sea oh they shook us off and shipped us oer the foam to the larger lands that lure man to roam and we took the chance they gave of far and foreign grave and we bade goodby for evermore to home and some of us are climbing on the peak and some of us are camping on the plain by pine and palm you ll find us with never claim to bind us by track and trail you ll meet us once again we are the fated serfs to freedom sky and sea we have failed where slummy cities overflow but the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth and we go into the dark as fighters go yes we go into the night as brave men go though our faces they be often streaked with woe yet we re hard as cats to kill and our hearts are reckless still and we ve danced with death dozen times or so and you ll find us in alaska after gold and you ll find us herding cattle in the south we like strong drink and fun and when the race is run we often die with curses in our mouth we are wild as colts unbroke but never mean of our sins we ve shoulders broad to bear the blame but we ll never stay in town and we ll never settle down and we ll never have an object or an aim no there that in us that time can never tame and life will always seem careless game and they better far forget those who say they love us yet forget blot out with bitterness our name new year eve it cruel cold on the waterfront silent and dark and drear only the black tide weltering only the hissing snow and alone like stormtossed wreck on this night of the glad new year shuffling along in the icy wind ghastly and gaunt and slow they re playing tune in mcguffy saloon and it cheery and bright in there god but weak since the bitter dawn and never bite of food ll just go over and slip inside must nt give way to despair perhaps can bum little booze if the boys are feeling good they ll jeer at me and they ll sneer at me and they ll call me whiskey soak have drink well thankee kindly sir do nt mind if do drivelling dirty ginjoint fiend the butt of the barroom joke sunk and sodden and hopeless another well here to you mcguffy is showing bunch of the boys how bob fitzsimmons hit the barman is talking of tammany hall and why the ward boss got fired ll just sneak into corner and they ll let me alone bit the room is reeling round and round god but tired tired roses she wore on her breast that night oh but their scent was sweet alone we sat on the balcony and the fanpalms arched above the witching strain of waltz by strauss came up to our cool retreat and prisoned her little hand in mine and whispered my plea of love then sudden the laughter died on her lips and lowly she bent her head and oh there came in the deep dark eyes look that was heaven to see and the moments went and waited there and never word was said and she plucked from her bosom rose of red and shyly gave it to me then the music swelled to crash of joy and the lights blazed up like day and held her fast to my throbbing heart and kissed her bonny brow she is mine she is mine for evermore the violins seemed to say and the bells were ringing the new year in god can hear them now do nt you remember that long last waltz with its sobbing sad refrain do nt you remember that last goodby and the dear eyes dim with tears do nt you remember that golden dream with never hint of pain of lives that would blend like an angelsong in the bliss of the coming years oh what have lost what have lost ethel forgive forgive the red red rose is faded now and it fifty years ago twere better to die thousand deaths than live each day as live have sinned have sunk to the lowest depths but oh have suffered so hark oh hark can hear the bells look can see her there fair as dream but it fades and now can hear the dreadful hum of the crowded court see the judge looks down not guilty my lord swear the bells can hear the bells again ethel come come rouse up old man it twelve oclock you ca nt sleep here you know say ai nt you got no sentiment lift up your muddled head have drink to the glad new

life hard luck has of hope bereft you health is failing wish you die why you ve still the sunshine left you and the big blue sky sky so blue it makes you wonder if it heaven shining through earth so smiling way out yonder sun so bright it dazzles you birds asinging flowers aflinging all their fragrance on the breeze dancing shadows green still meadows do nt you mope you ve still got these these and none can take them from you these and none can weigh their worth what you re tired and broke and beaten why you re rich you ve got the earth yes if you re tramp in tatters while the blue sky bends above you ve got nearly all that matters you ve got god and god is love the harpy there was woman and she was wise woefully wise was she she was old so old yet her years all told were but score and three and she knew by heart from finish to start the book of iniquity there is no hope for such as on earth nor yet in heaven unloved live unloved die unpitied unforgiven loathed jade ply my trade unhallowed and unshriven paint my cheeks for they are white and cheeks of chalk men hate mine eyes with wine make them shine that man may seek and sate with overhead lamp of red sit me down and wait until they come the nightly scum with drunken eyes aflame your sweethearts sons ye scornful ones is who know their shame the gods ye see are brutes to me and so play my game for life is not the thing we thought and not the thing we plan and woman in bitter world must do the best she can must yield the stroke and bear the yoke and serve the will of man must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire though be she loved for love alone or be she loved for hire for every man since life began is tainted with the mire and though you know he love you so and set you on love throne yet let your eyes but mock his sighs and let your heart be stone lest you be left as was left attainted and alone from love close kiss to hell abyss is one sheer flight trow and wedding ring and bridal bell are willowisps of woe and is not wise to love too well and this all women know wherefore the wolfpack having gorged upon the lamb their prey with siren smile and serpent guile make the wolfpack pay with velvet paws and flensing claws tigress roused to slay one who in youth sought truest truth and found devil lies symbol of the sin of man human sacrifice yet shall blame on man the shame could it be otherwise was not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride the maker marred and evilstarred drift upon his tide and he alone shall judge his own so his judgment bide fate has written tragedy its name is the human heart the theatre is the house of life woman the mummer part the devil enters the prompter box and the play is ready to start premonition twas year ago and the moon was bright oh remember so well so well walked with my love in sea of light and the voice of my sweet was silver bell and sudden the moon grew strangely dull and sudden my love had taken wing looked on the face of grinning skull strained to my heart ghastly thing was but fantasy for my love lay still in my arms with her tender eyes aglow and she wondered why my lips were chill why was silent and kissed her so year has gone and the moon is bright gibbous moon like ghost of woe sit by newmade grave tonight and my heart is broken it strange you know the tramps can you recall dear comrade when we tramped god land together and we sang the old old earthsong for our youth was very sweet when we drank and fought and lusted as we mocked at tie and tether along the road to anywhere the wide world at our feet along the road to anywhere when each day had its story when time was yet our vassal and life jest was still unstale when peace unfathomed filled our hearts as bathed in amber glory along the road to anywhere we watched the sunsets pale alas the road to anywhere is pitfalled with disaster there hunger want and weariness yet we loved it so as on we tramped exultantly and no man was our master and no man guessed what dreams were ours as swinging heel and toe we tramped the road to anywhere the magic road to anywhere the tragic road to anywhere such dear dim years ago lenvoi you who have lived in the land you who have trusted the trail you who are strong to withstand you who are swift to assail songs have sung to beguile vintage of desperate years hard as harlot smile bitter as unshed tears little of joy or mirth little of ease sing sagas of men of earth humanly suffering such as you all have done savagely faring forth sons of the midnight sun argonauts of the north far in the land god forgot glimmers the lure of your trail still in your lust are you taught even to win is to fail still you must follow and fight under the vampire wing there in the long long night hoping and vanquishing husbandman of the wild reaping barren gain scourged by desire reconciled unto disaster and pain these my songs are for you you who are seared with the brand god knows have tried to be true please god you will understand end
