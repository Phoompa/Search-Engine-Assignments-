untidy room of the first floor in baker street which had been the startingpoint of so many remarkable adventures he looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall the acidcharred bench of chemicals the violincase leaning in the corner the coalscuttle which contained of old the pipes and tobacco fi nally his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of billy the young but very wise and tactful page who had helped little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective it all seems very unchanged billy you do nt change ei ther hope the same can be said of him billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom think he in bed and asleep he said it was seven in the evening of lovely summer day but dr watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend hours to feel no surprise at the idea that means case suppose yes sir he is very hard at it just now frightened for his health he gets paler and thinner and he eats nothing when will you be pleased to dine mr holmes mrs hudson asked seventhirty the day after tomorrow said he you know his way when he is keen on case yes billy know he following someone yesterday he was out as work man looking for job today he was an old woman fairly took me in he did and ought to know his ways by now billy pointed with grin to very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa that part of the old woman outfit he said but what is it all about billy billy sank his voice as one who discusses great secrets of state do nt mind telling you sir but it should go no farther it this case of the crown diamond what the hundredthousandpound burglary yes sir they must get it back sir why we had the prime minister and the home secretary both sitting on that very sofa mr holmes was very nice to them he soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could then there is lord cantlemere ah yes sir you know what that means he stiffun sir if may say so can get along with the prime minister and ive nothing against the home secretary who seemed civil oblig ing sort of man but ca nt stand his lordship neither can mr holmes sir you see he do nt believe in mr holmes and he was against employing him he rather he failed and mr holmes knows it mr holmes always knows whatever there is to know well we ll hope he wo nt fail and that lord cantlemere will be confounded but say billy what is that curtain for across the window mr holmes had it put up there three days ago we ve got something funny behind it billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window dr watson could not restrain cry of amazement there was facsimile of his old friend dressinggown and all the face turned threequarters towards the window and downward as though reading an invisible book while the body was sunk deep in an armchair billy detached the head and held it in the air we put it at different angles so that it may seem more lifelike would nt dare touch it if the blind were not down but when it up you can see this from across the way we used something of the sort once before before my time said billy he drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street there are folk who watch us from over yonder can see fellow now at the window have look for yourself watson had taken step forward when the bedroom door opened and the long thin form of holmes emerged his face pale and drawn but his step and bearing as active as ever with single spring he was at the window and had drawn the blind once more that will do billy said he you were in danger of your life then my boy and ca nt do without you just yet well watson it is good to see you in your old quarters once again you come at critical moment so gather you can go billy that boy is problem watson how far am justified in allowing him to be in danger danger of what holmes of sudden death expecting something this evening expecting what to be murdered watson no no you are joking holmes even my limited sense of humour could evolve better joke than that but we may be comfortable in the meantime may we not is alcohol permitted the gasogene and cigars are in the old place let me see you once more in the customary armchair you have not hope learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco it has to take the place of food these days but why not eat because the faculties become refined when you starve them why surely as doctor my dear watson you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain am brain watson the rest of me is mere appendix therefore it is the brain must consider but this danger holmes ah yes in case it should come off it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer you can give it to scotland yard with my love and parting blessing sylvius is the name count negretto sylvius write it down man write it down 136 moorside gardens got it watson honest face was twitching with anxiety he knew only too well the immense risks taken by holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be understatement than exaggeration watson was always the man of action and he rose to the occasion count me in holmes have nothing to do for day or two your morals do nt improve watson you have added fib bing to your other vices you bear every sign of the busy medical man with calls on him every hour not such important ones but ca nt you have this fellow arrested yes watson could that what worries him so but why do nt you because do nt know where the diamond is ah billy told me the missing crown jewel yes the great yellow mazarin stone ve cast my net and have my fish but have not got the stone what is the use of taking them we can make the world better place by laying them by the heels but that is not what am out for it the stone want and is this count sylvius one of your fish yes and he shark he bites the other is sam merton the boxer not bad fellow sam but the count has used him sam not shark he is great big silly bullheaded gudgeon but he is flopping about in my net all the same where is this count sylvius ve been at his very elbow all the morning you ve seen me as an old lady watson was never more convincing he actually picked up my parasol for me once by your leave madame said he halfltalian you know and with the south ern graces of manner when in the mood but devil incarnate in the other mood life is full of whimsical happenings watson it might have been tragedy well perhaps it might followed him to old straubenzees workshop in the minories straubenzee made the airgun very pretty bit of work as understand and rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment have you seen the dummy of course billy showed it to you well it may get bullet through its beautiful head at any moment ah billy what is it the boy had reappeared in the room with card upon tray holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile the man himself had hardly expected this grasp the nettle watson man of nerve possibly you have heard of his reputation as shooter of big game it would indeed be triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag this is proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel send for the police probably shall but not just yet would you glance care fully out of the window watson and see if anyone is hanging about in the street watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain yes there is one rough fellow near the door that will be sam merton the faithful but rather fatuous sam where is this gentleman billy in the waitingroom sir show him up when ring yes sir if am not in the room show him in all the same yes sir watson waited until the door was closed and then he turned earnestly to his companion look here holmes this is simply impossible this is desperate man who sticks at nothing he may have come to murder you should not be surprised insist upon staying with you you would be horribly in the way in his way no my dear fellow in my way well ca nt possibly leave you yes you can watson and you will for you have never failed to play the game am sure you will play it to the end this man has come for his own purpose but he may stay for mine holmes took out his notebook and scribbled few lines take cab to scotland yard and give this to youghal of the come back with the police the fellow arrest will follow ll do that with joy before you return may have just time enough to find out where the stone is he touched the bell think we will go out through the bedroom this second exit is exceedingly useful rather want to see my shark without his seeing me and have as you will remember my own way of doing it it was therefore an empty room into which billy minute later ushered count sylvius the famous gameshot sportsman and manabouttown was big swarthy fellow with formida ble dark moustache shading cruel thinlipped mouth and surmounted by long curved nose like the beak of an eagle he was well dressed but his brilliant necktie shining pin and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect as the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce startled eyes like one who suspects trap at every turn then he gave violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressinggown which projected above the armchair in the win dow at first his expression was one of pure amazement then the light of horrible hope gleamed in his dark murderous eyes he took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses and then on tiptoe his thick stick half raised he approached the silent figure he was crouching for his final spring and blow when cool sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door do nt break it count do nt break it the assassin staggered back amazement in his convulsed face for an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original but there was something in that steady gray eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side it pretty little thing said holmes advancing towards the image tavernier the french modeller made it he is as good at waxworks as your friend straubenzee is at airguns airguns sir what do you mean put your hat and stick on the sidetable thank you pray take seat would you care to put your revolver out also oh very good if you prefer to sit upon it your visit is really most opportune for wanted badly to have few minutes chat with you the count scowled with heavy threatening eyebrows too wished to have some words with you holmes that is why am here wo nt deny that intended to assault you just now holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head said he but why these personal attentions because you have gone out of your way to annoy me because you have put your creatures upon my track my creatures assure you no nonsense have had them followed two can play at that game holmes it is small point count sylvius but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me you can understand that with my routine of work should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues gallery and you will agree that exceptions are invidious well mr holmes then excellent but assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents count sylvius laughed contemptuously other people can observe as well as you yesterday there was an old sporting man today it was an elderly woman they held me in view all day really sir you compliment me old baron dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost and now you give my little impersona tions your kindly praise it was you you yourself holmes shrugged his shoulders you can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the minories before you began to suspect if had known you might never have seen this humble home again was well aware of it we all have neglected opportunities to deplore as it happens you did not know so here we are the count knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes what you say only makes the matter worse it was not your agents but your playacting busybody self you admit that you have dogged me why come now count you used to shoot lions in algeria well but why why the sport the excitement the danger and no doubt to free the country from pest exactly my reasons in nutshell the count sprang to his feet and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hippocket sit down sir sit down there was another more practical reason want that yellow diamond count sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile upon my word said he you knew that was after you for that the real reason why you are here tonight is to find out how much know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential well should say that from your point of view it is absolutely essen tial for know all about it save only one thing which you are about to tell me oh indeed and pray what is this missing fact where the crown diamond now is the count looked sharply at his companion oh you want to know that do you how the devil should be able to lell you where it is you can and you will indeed you ca nt bluff me count sylvius holmes eyes as he gazed at him contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel you are absolute plateglass see to the very back of your mind then of course you see where the diamond is holmes clapped his hands with amusement and then pointed derisive finger then you do know you have admitted it admit nothing now count if you will be reasonable we can do business if not you will get hurt count sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling and you talk about bluff said he holmes looked at him thoughtfully like master chessplayer who meditates his crowning move then he threw open the table drawer and drew out squat notebook do you know what keep in this book no sir do not you me yes sir you you are all here every action of yor vile and dangerous life damn you holmes cried the count with blazing eyes there are limits to my patience it all here count the real facts as to the death of old mrs harold who left you the blymer estate which you so rapidly gambled away you are dreaming and the complete life history of miss minnie warrender tut you will make nothing of that plenty more here count here is the robbery in the train deluxe to the riviera on february 13 1892 here is the forged check in the same year on the credit lyonnais no you re wrong there then am right on the others now count you are cardplayer when the other fellow has all the trumps it saves time to throw down your hand what has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke gently count restrain that eager mind let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion have all this against you but above all have clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the crown diamond indeed have the cabman who took you to whitehall and the cabman who brought you away have the commissionaire who saw you near the case have ikey sanders who refused to cut it up for you ikey has peached and the game is up the veins stood out on the count forehead his dark hairy hands were clenched in convulsion of restrained emotion he tried to speak but the words would not shape themselves that the hand play from said holmes put it all upon the table but one card is missing it the king of dia monds do nt know where the stone is you never shall know no now be reasonable count consider the situation you are going to be locked up for twenty years so is sam merton what good are you going to get out of your diamond none in the world but if you hand it over well ll compound felony we do nt want you or sam we want the stone give that up and so far as am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future if you make another slip well it will be the last but this time my commission is to get the stone not you but if refuse why then alas it must be you and not the stone billy had appeared in answer to ring think count that it would be as well to have your friend sam at this conference after all his interests should be repre sented billy you will see large and ugly gentleman outside the front door ask him to come up if he wo nt come sir no violence billy do nt be rough with him if you tell him that count sylvius wants him he will certainly come what are you going to do now asked the count as billy disappeared my friend watson was with me just now told him that had shark and gudgeon in my net now am drawing the net and up they come together the count had risen from his chair and his hand was behind his back holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressinggown you wo nt die in your bed holmes have often had the same idea does it matter very much aher all count your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal but these anticipations of the future are morbid why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present sudden wildbeast light sprang up in the dark menacing eyes of the master criminal holmes figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready it is no use your fingering your revolver my friend he said in quiet voice you know perfectly well that you dare not use it even if gave you time to draw it nasty noisy things revolvers count better stick to airguns ah think hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner good day mr merton rather dull in the street is it not the prizefighter heavily built young man with stupid obstinate slabsided face stood awkwardly at the door looking about him with puzzled expression holmes debonair manner was new experience and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile he did not know how to counter it he turned to his more astute comrade for help what the game now count what this fellow want what up his voice was deep and raucous the count shrugged his shoulders and it was holmes who answered if may put it in nutshell mr merton should say it was all up the boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate is this cove trying to be funny or what not in the funny mood myself no expect not said holmes think can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances now look here count sylvius busy man and cant waste time going into that bedroom pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence you can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence shall try over the hoffman barcarole upon my violin in five min utes shall return for your final answer you quite grasp the alternative do you not shall we take you or shall we have the stone holmes withdrew picking up his violin from the corner as he passed few moments later the longdrawn wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom what is it then asked merton anxiously as his companion turned to him does he know about the stone he knows damned sight too much about it not sure that he does nt know all about it good lord the boxer sallow face turned shade whiter ikey sanders has split on us he has has he ll do him down thick un for that if swing for it that wo nt help us much we ve got to make up our minds what to do half mo said the boxer looking suspiciously at the bedroom door he leary cove that wants watching sup pose he not listening how can he be listening with that music going that right maybe somebody behind curtain too many curtains in this room as he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window and stood staring and pointing too amazed for words tut it only dummy said the count fake is it well strike me madame tussaud ai nt in it it the living spit of him gown and all but them curtains count oh confound the curtains we are wasting our time and there is none too much he can lag us over this stone the deuce he can but he ll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is what give it up give up hundred thousand quid it one or the other merton scratched his shortcropped pate he alone in there let do him in if his light were out we should have nothing to fear the count shook his head he is armed and ready if we shot him we could hardly get away in place like this besides it likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got hallo what was that there was vague sound which seemed to come from the window both men sprang round but all was quiet save for the one strange figure seated in the chair the room was certainly empty something in the street said merton now look here guvnor you ve got the brains surely you can think way out of it if slugging is no use then it up to you ve fooled better men than he the count answered the stone is here in my secret pocket take no chances leaving it about it can be out of england tonight and cut into four pieces in amsterdam before sunday he knows nothing of van seddar thought van seddar was going next week he was but now he must get off by the next boat one or other of us must slip round with the stone to lime street and tell him but the false bottom ai nt ready well he must take it as it is and chance it there not moment to lose again with the sense of danger which be comes an instinct with the sportsman he paused and looked hard at the window yes it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come as to holmes he continued we can fool him easily enough you see the damned fool wo nt arrest us if he can get the stone well we ll promise him the stone we ll put him on the wrong track about it and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in holland and we out of the country that sounds good to me cried sam merton with grin you go on and tell the dutchman to get move on him ill see this sucker and fill him up with bogus confession ll tell him that the stone is in liverpool confound that whining music it gets on my nerves by the time he finds it is nt in liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water come back here out of line with that keyhole here is the stone wonder you dare carry it where could have it safer if we could take it out of whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings let have look at it count sylvius cast somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was ex tended towards him what ye think going to snatch it off you see here mister getting bit tired of your ways well well no offence sam we ca nt afford to quarrel come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly now hold it to the light here thank you with single spring holmes had leaped from the dummys chair and had grasped the precious jewel he held it now in one hand while his other pointed revolver at the count head the two villains staggered back in utter amazement before they had recovered holmes had pressed the electric bell no violence gentlemen no violence beg of you con sider the furniture it must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one the police are waiting below the count bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear but how the deuce he gasped your surprise is very natural you are not aware that second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain fancied that you must have heard me when displaced the figure but luck was on my side it gave me chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence the count gave gesture of resignation we give you best holmes believe you are the devil himself not far from him at any rate holmes answered with polite smile sam merton slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation now as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside he broke silence at last fair cop said he but say what about that bloomin fiddle hear it yet tut tut holmes answered you are perfectly right let it play these modern gramophones are remarkable invention there was an inrush of police the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab watson lingered with holmes congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable billy with his cardtray lord cantlemere sir show him up biily this is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests said holmes he is an excellent and loyal person but rather of the old regime shall we make him unbend dare we venture upon slight liberty he knows we may conjecture nothing of what has occurred the door opened to admit thin austere figure with hatchet face and drooping midvictorian whiskers of glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and fee ble gait holmes advanced affably and shook an unresponsive hand how do you do lord cantlemere it is chilly for the time of year but rather warm indoors may take your overcoat no thank you will not take it off holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve pray allow me my friend dr watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious his lordship shook himself free with some impatience am quite comfortable sir have no need to stay have simply looked in to know how your selfappointed task was progressing it is difficult very difficult feared that you would find it so there was distinct sneer in the old courtier words and manner every man finds his limitations mr holmes but at least it cures us of the weakness of selfsatisfaction yes sir have been much perplexed no doubt especially upon one point possibly you could help me upon you apply for my advice rather late in the day thought that you had your own allsufficient methods still am ready to help you you see lord cantlemere we can no doubt frame case against the actual thieves when you have caught them exactly but the question is how shall we proceed against the receiver is this not rather premature it is as well to have our plans ready now what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver the actual possession of the stone you would arrest him upon that most undoubtedly holmes seldom laughed but he got as near it as his old friend watson could remember in that case my dear sir shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest lord cantlemere was very angry some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks you take great liberty mr holmes in fifty years of official life can not recall such case am busy man sir engaged upon important affairs and have no time or taste for foolish jokes may tell you frankly sir that have never been believer in your powers and that have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force your conduct confirms all my conclusions have the honour sir to wish you goodevening holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door one moment sir said he to actually go off with the mazarin stone would be more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it sir this is intolerable let me pass put your hand in the righthand pocket of your overcoat what do you mean sir come come do what ask an instant later the amazed peer was standing blinking and stammering with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm what what how is this mr holmes too bad lord cantlemere too bad cried holmes my old friend here will tell you that have an impish habit of practical joking also that can never resist dramatic situation took the liberty the very great liberty admit of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview the old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him sir am bewildered but yes it is indeed the mazarin stone we are greatly your debtors mr holmes your sense of humour may as you admit be somewhat perverted and its exhibition remarkably untimely but at least withdraw any reflection have made upon your amazing professional powers but how the case is but half finished the details can wait no doubt lord cantlemere your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke billy you will show his lord ship out and tell mrs hudson that should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible
