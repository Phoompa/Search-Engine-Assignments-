iron bars he reached long muscular arm to the phone picked it up and dialed the number silona had given him silona laid on the bed in druggedout stupor having administered weak injection of heroin to herself moments ago no chance of her overhearing his conversation at her level of decadence words were just background noise to the dreamy images that floated in and out of her mind yet he would whisper during the phone conversation for fear of inserting unsavory ideas into her subconscious sometimes when he watched the news on tv while she was tripping she hear gunfire and start screaming he watched as her right leg twitched slightly to the side three rings and man answered it was matt yes he said gruffly this is alvin pause hey where ve you been you know that pizza place down by king

moaned wuh thuh fuh you talkin bout lebe me alone he looked at her disgustedly it was his fault having her stuck to him like jailhouse ball and chain dragging at his feet hindering his every step thin line of drool sagged from her lips she never quit shooting smack and to hell with his suggestion that she try methadone he could take the first taxi to hell as far as she was concerned because he never did nuthin for her he just nagged and whined all the time about this and that and she was sick of it sick of him sometimes she felt she should just take all his stuff while he gone and leave him for good but she was just sticking around for the sake of their kid three hours ago they had fought she had shouted give me the money do nt ask for much give me the money earned this week just for being around taking care of your child you bastard she had cried he stared at her grimly but eventually relented and now she was stoned again he was 16 when he changed the course of his life she was country girl who he met at the grocery store where they worked he bagger she cashier they flirted he took her out and she gave him what he wanted many times every day in fact and for hours they would screw anywhere just on dare in the woods in the car of course in the stock room in confession booth at local cathedral on top of the store roof when she had his baby he felt an overpowering sense of responsibility overcome him his offspring his link into the future holier than anything in his life he married her and tried to straighten up parts of his life he quit dealing dope he quit performing hits on people that pissed his friends off he went good he was compact but shockingly strong man of feet even who could smash through locked doors and likewise human skulls the secrets to his power were genetics bodybuilding and anabolic steroids he used all three heavily to his utmost benefit but so far as success was concerned he was failure certainly his mind and body were well developed as whole his conversations were truly art and people sat rapt in attention listening to him speak but he was bagboy earned 25 cents above minimum wage at the piggly wiggly scrubbed toliets mopped floors pampered obnoxious customers and had to submit to lie detector tests every months as part of the chain policy on curbing employee theft get him on his own turf the battleground of words and prose and you better verify your insurance policy but ask him to calculate next month debits and credits or sit him at computer terminal and he is lost dazed and wondering child the business world spun past him oblivious to his energies he put in 10 hours day at the store and additional hours in the gym working out his psychic storms on iron bars and heavy weights other jocks looked on him with both respect and apprehension because while his body boasted of inhuman strength his eyes told of furious rage within him that they could never understand when he did finally return home to their meager 200month apartment his wife would be stationed at the television glazed and unresponsive his child now would leap up from the sofa and fall into his arms and sometimes cry mommy hit me daddy that would stab him deeper than any knife could pierce through his steely chest once in fury he jolted her from her stupor with roar what did you do to my child you bitch her eyes darted to him in panic he stormed over to her and hoisted her in the air by her shoulders why why why did you do it she told him very smoothly very quietly to put her down or he would regret it you know damn well she whispered darkly my family would have you killed no matter where you go or what you do you bastard he yelled and hurled her across the room where she collapsed against table knocked out cold but when she awoke she found bottle of captain morgan 50 dollars and two hits of smack by her side he and his son stayed out that night and returned the next morning he felt he had one option one key that would unlock the final door who had never been able to smash through if he had money money is power money is freedom if he had enough he could take his kid to europe and finance secret life that would never be discovered by her mafioso cronies he never get anywhere in the business world and he never make it out in other parts of the country he had to take big chance and why not it was nt like he had lot to lose his only concern was for his kid and that made his heart tremble he had to do it right no leeway for blunders he pulled on his shoes and left to go jogging in two hours he meet matt and they would talk of crime sprinting lightly gaining speed jogging by people on the sidewalk we were in love back then were nt we we thought so on dark summer nights when we were alone in the car parked by
