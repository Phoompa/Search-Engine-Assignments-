current situation not bad consid ering had my knife two throwing spikes and one flechette round left in my pistol and counted no more than three of the enemy left mobile out there damn cats had been ready to mount major offensive but had caught them little flat footed they were nt expecting anyone to come by the mobile home where my friend disk driver lived shaggra hadnt expected to come by either but since happened to be in the neighbor hood you know how the rest goes pulled up noticing that the lights were on and music playing loudly over driver stereo the high volume was typical but it did nt strike me as odd until later that the music had definite martial sound to it sort of like military parade music grinning to myself and planning to put scare into driver by crashing the party moved quietly up to the front door turned the knob and leaped into the living room screaming at the top of my lungs driver was definitely surprised he jumped noticeably on the couch where he was tied and noticed his eyes widen above the gag that had been tied firmly in place hold it let do quick inventory driver tied and gagged on the couch military music still playing on the stereo next to the computer that was now displaying what looked suspiciously like city more nns map was small banner showing sword held in an armored fist also in the room were few dozen cats the typical house hold varieties who were wearing these odd pack like objects strapped to thier persons standing next to the banner was cat who was somewhat larger than the rest wearing his own pack plus something that looked like half armor and helmet with goggles continued reply quit msg 3086 sec tall tales 07mar89 0404 pm subj the felis humano wars ii from thief killer to cat lovers wait back up the large cat was standing as in two legs and it did nt seem to occur to him as it did to me that this was in any way peculiar if he did find it strange he covered it up quite well with his initial surprise at my entrance then with the hastily uttered commands to the other cats in the room as saw the cats begin to react to my presence it occured to me that if was going to have time to be surprised by these recent revelations was going to have to do good job of getting myself out of here turnjumped back to the still open door behind me my mind only half registering the silvery field that sprang up in front of it it gaveslightly as hit and threw me forcibly back into the room im glad my mind had half noticed it for that was all needed to tuck and roll my way back to my feet oh boy technologically advanced cats just my day my mind decided to let some of the surprise seep in as stared at the barrier in ill concealed shock there was high pitched chuckle behind me that worked up the nerve to turn around and face what going to assume was the cat leader was facing me with his hands behind his back why did it bother me so to see cat in this particular posture he was talking to me should be listening surrender seems to be the only option available to you dont you agree more nns his voice was oddly accented and like already noticed high pitched but it had certain musical quality that made it sound slightly oriental oh come now he assume said with some asperity you are out numbered and unarmed each one of my troops is armed with high intensity flame thrower that will fry you where you stand much easier than the human fortifications that we plan on hitting tonight his next comment clued me that my expressions were displaying my thoughts and that somehow this cat commander had learn to read human body language continued reply quit msg 3087 sec tall tales 07mar89 0406 pm subj the felishumano wars from thief killer to cat lovers faking surprise will avail you not do not try and disguise the fact that you came to spy and try to figure out someway to stop cat domination of this globe on second thought it occurs to me that you are now much to dangerous to be allowed to live troopers take this spy and the other human animal outside and incinerate them do it quickly we are ready to launch the attack now and we have no time to waste been watching the cats with their flame throwers and it dawned on me that they were nt really combat trained soldiers they had just been recently impressed into service and the cat commander was de pending on surprise to carry the night it was really shame he thought was unarmed was hoping that their lack ofcombatreflexes would play to my advantage as pulled my machine pistol and let loose with automatic flechette rounds at the cats jostling for the honor of killing the first human in this war cats yowled and screamed as armor and muscle tearing slivers ripped into thier ranks many of the deadly flakes tore into the gel fuel packs that supplied the flame throwers since my rounds were nonincendiary no damage was done until one of the trigger happy tried to hose me then the fun started as the fuel ignited and some of the packs exploded spraying the interior of the mobile home with burning fuel it would nt be until later that learned that the concussion had overturned the couch and the thick material had saved driver from being more nns caught in the inferno as was busy trying to save my own hide did nt feel bad about it until dived for cover behind the kitchen counter let me tell you my conscience ate me up for few seconds there even avoided shooting at the cat commander for the simple fact that he been standing too close to driver and probably would have caught him with some of the slivers as well continued

now was the time to leave let the police and fire departments try and figure this one out looking at the back door and the windows noticed that silvery field over them as well standing up noticed the front door was still similarly protected also noticed that the fires were dying down quickly maybe there was something to all the advertising about the fireresistant materials that went into the construction of modern homes still had two rounds left so aimed at the field on the front door and squeezed the field incresed in brightness as the slivers struck the field and stuck there melting rapidly into whitehot liquid perhaps it would be feasible to consider turning the field off before attempted an exit dropped heavily to the floor as pain exploded in my leg from pencil thin beam of light the cat commander stood up to his full 15 cradling similarly scaled rifle in the crook of his right forelegarm flanking him on either side were two normal four footed cats with flamers and goggles recognized these two they were driver own cats suddenly gone technopunk this was not good before kill you animal the commander sneered will allow you to die with the satisfaction of knowing that you have completely thwarted our invasion plans the world as you know it will be safe for few more of our generations think of yourself as hero more nns he took step back still covering me with the rifle and depressed key on the computer the air next to him shimmered slightly and coalesced into silvery circle about feet across continued reply quit msg 3089 sec tall tales 07mar89 0412 pm subj

to driver two cats lieutenants finish him off and then prepare to gate through with me so can show you how cats were truly meant to live in desperation dived back behind the kitchen counter and pushed against the barrier blocking the sliding glass doors no luck it didnt do more than give slightly hearing the cats moving closer and not exactly relishing the idea of being burned to death slid quietly back to the corner of the counter and slid out both throwing spikes assuming correctly that was dangerous the cats were moving carefully as well but they werent yet accustomed to the added bulk of the flamers and could see thier crouching shadows cast by the silvery gate circle as they were getting ready to pounce threw one spike at the wall opposite my position as the cats spun to confront the new soundthreat the second spike quickly followed it into the fuel pack of one of the lieutenants shaggra was glad could nt remember thier names right then did nt want to think of them as the cute cuddly furballs they had once been but as the killersoldiers they had become did nt know how the damnable flamers were triggered but was depending on inexperience as brought one hand down on the unspiked cat already spooked and jumpy he cut loose at the target that made more nns sure his body was aimed at his fellow lieutenant the exploding pack was close enough to me and the cat held down that we both got singed as the others yowl was quickly silenced in the engulfing flames continued reply quit msg 3090 sec tall tales 07mar89 0414 pm subj the felishumano wars6 from thief killer to cat lovers the cat held pulled trick that all cats have known since they were first created somehow he managed to twist around in my grip and fasten his claws in my arm picked him and threw him bodily across the room leaving deep bloody gashes in my arm and through the waiting gate circle he disappeared with an audible pop the commander leveled his rifle at me and fired the bright red beam missed but my last flechette round did nt his armor managed to stop most of it but few managed to tear flesh and the the rifle dropped from his now useless arm he glared at me from the computer terminal ll be back human but next time ll have you fighting in the arena for the entertainment of the audiences back home with that he stepped through the circle and disappeared let my shoulders slump and allowed myself to feel what damage had been done to me it was then heard muffled thumpings and yellings from behind the over turned couch tipping it back was pleased to discover driver just little bit mussed from all the excitement began helping them up when heard thump behind me spinning around halfexpecting to see more soldier cats calmed down when did nt see anyone my attention was captured however by small round object that lay on the body litterd and burned floor near the still shimmering gate circle hissing slightly the cat commander would nt be such poor sport that he would throw more nns grenade back through the gate now would he thought out loud not wanting the take any chances flipped the knife still had left at it and catching it just right watched it tumble back through the circle then reached over and turned the computer off watching with some satisfaction as the barrier fields and the gate circle shimmered into nonexistence after all playing game of interdimensional hot potato is something save for the holidays reply quit
