rewritten by the quantum mechanic for years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted light however recent information has proven otherwise electric bulbs do nt emit light they suck dark thus we call these bulbs dark suckers the dark sucker theory proves that the existence of dark has mass heavier than that of light and that dark is faster than light the basis of the dark sucker theory is that electric bulbs suck dark take for example the dark suckers in the room where you are there is much less dark right next to them than there is elsewhere the larger the dark sucker the greater its capacity to suck dark dark suckers in parking lot have much greater capacity than the ones in this room as with all things dark suckers do nt last forever once they are full of dark they can no longer suck this is proven by the black spot on full dark sucker candle is primitive dark sucker new candle has white wick you will notice that after the first use the wick turns black representing all of the dark which has been sucked into it if you hold pencil next to the wick of an operating candle the tip will turn black because it got in the way of the dark flowing into the candle unfortunately these primitive dark suckers have very limited range there are also portable dark suckers the bulbs in these ca nt handle all of the dark by themselves and must be aided by dark storage unit when the dark storage unit is full it must be either emptied or replaced before the portable dark sucker can operate again dark has mass when dark goes into dark sucker friction from its mass generates heat thus it is not wise to touch an operating dark sucker candles present special problem as the dark must travel into solid wick instead of through clear glass this generates great amount of heat thus it can be dangerous to touch an operating candle dark is also heavier than light if you swim just below the surface of lake you see lot of light if you slowly swim deeper and deeper you notice it slowly getting darker and darker this is because the heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake and the lighter light floats to the top the immense power of dark can be utilized to man advantage we can collect the dark that has settled to the bottom of lakes and push it through turbine which generates electricity and helps push the dark to the ocean where it may be safely stored prior to turbines it was much more difficult to get the dark from the rivers and lakes to the ocean the indians recognized this problem and tried to solve it when on river in canoe travelling in the same direction as the flow of dark they paddled slowly so as not to stop the flow of dark but when they travelled against the flow of dark they paddled quickly so as to help push the dark along its way finally we must prove that dark is faster than light if you were to stand in an illuminated room in front of closed dark closet then slowly open the closet door you would see the light slowly enter the closet but since the dark is so fast you would not be able to see the dark leave the closet in conclusion would like to say that dark suckers make all of our lives much easier so the next time you look at an electric bulb remember that it is indeed dark sucker downloaded from the pinnacle club auckland nz thanks bernadette
