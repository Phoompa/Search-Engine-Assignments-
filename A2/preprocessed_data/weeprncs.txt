the weeping princess once upon time greedy emperor forced his subjects to pay heavy taxes not only the poor were squeezed but the nobles in this immense empire were highly taxed too at last tired of being crushed by taxes the nobles held protest meeting when the emperor heard about this he took fright for he feared rebellion so he sent out this proclamation to put an end to their complaints the nobleman that can make my daughter sarah smile again for she mourning the loss of her fiance will never pay taxes again this caused an uproar at the protest meeting most of the princes decided there was no need now to complain for each was quite sure he would succeed where others might fail so off they went to get ready to try and make sarah smile but some of the nobles warned their fellows that with his words the emperor was not really abolishing any taxes at all from that day on long procession of noble knights trooped from all over the empire to the palace to try and console the weeping princess the crowds cheered them as they passed but when they returned with bowed heads the same crowds booed and whistled at their failure the days went by and the list of defeated knights grew longer indians circassians arabs and turks from all over the provinces came bold young men bouncing with confidence and hope but the minute the princess set eyes on them she just wept and wept the emperor was delighted for each failure meant another taxpayer even the common folk seemed contented to see that the rich too did not always get what they wanted the only unhappy person among them was sarah who went on weeping one day mongol prince seemed to be on the point of winning smile he thrummed his balalaika for hours playing first sad tune then more cheerful one till he finished by playing merry jig the princess sat for ages staring at him eyed and the onlookers thought she was about to smile instead she burst into floods of tears to everyone disappointment kurdish chief famed for his humour who had already kept the court in fits of laughter tried to steal smile from sarah with his witty remarks but the princess dark eyes filled with tears noblemen came from as far away as persia but in vain the only person who had not yet appeared was omar the chief of the tiniest farthest away province bright intelligent young man he had cleverly got the better of certain greedy ambitious relatives that tried to take away his power when he succeeded his uncle as chief the emperor messengers had taken long time to reach this remote realm and though omar set out at once on hearing the news he rode for many days on his fine black horse then one evening he reached the palace when the tired and dusty traveller explained to the stable boys why he had come they laughed in scorn but they had orders to obey so they told him to enter it late they said and you wo nt see the princess till tomorrow the emperor other daughters however were soon told of the new arrival he the most handsome of them all exclaimed one of the servants so marika the emperor youngest and prettiest daughter with her sisters peeked through window at the sleeping omar next morning the emperor ordered the newcomer to be led before sarah the court crowded round to watch unlike all the other suitors omar did nothing at all to amuse the princess he stared at sarah without saying word and she stared back with an empty look on her face the two young people stared silently at each other then omar went back to the emperor and said sire give me your sceptre and will solve the problem of sarah surprised at such an odd request the emperor followed omar into sarah room the other princesses clustered round smiling and admiring the handsome young man with deep bow to sarah omar straightened up and dealt her blow on the head with the sceptre screams filled the air the emperor threw up hls arms in rage and his daughters fled in all directions the guards drew their swords then the whole room stopped in amazement for out of sarah head which had been chopped off by the blow rolled broken springs and pieces of metal the princess that never smiled was doll perfect dolll and nobody had ever been aware of it except omar the only princess that could nt stop laughing was marika the emperor glared at her be quiet he ordered but he too saw the funny side of it for the crafty emperor had been making use of sarah the doll as way of guaranteeing himself steady flow of taxes from all his subjects and now man more cunning than himself had exposed his trick the emperor had sudden thought he would rid himself of the cheeky marika and gain an astute soninlaw able to help him hold onto his kingdom you should be put to death for this insolence he said but going to spare your life if you marry my youngest daughter of course you wo nt need to pay taxes smiling at happy marika omar nodded silently down in the depths of his mind he was thinking one day dear fatherinlaw ll be sitting on your imperial throne and he was few years later
