asleep craig plesco asleep and my eyes see reality asleep and my mind focuses on the life could never indulge in petty concerns split my neurosystemdeath becomes but joke falling into the system where life becomes ever so painful the frustration of not knowing who is whom what is that why is this dateline age religious leaders spout sayings of eternal damnation spin through cycles of pitfalls and laugh at their blind nature what determines life how soon after death does one become useless in life when the moistness dries when the water subsides is water life for beings such as we perhaps this is true watersun coldhot what is where am not feel parched feeling too much heat sporadically am fed tiny droplets of life drink and savor and enjoy even basking in the heat then yearning creeps into me want to hold on but some stranger craig plesco bumped into nearby lamppost and studied my own neglect of environment my shoes casual acquaintance standing up felt surge of hatred contempt ran through my body twisted fully around and stared into the face had known would come chuckle chuckle laughed somehow didnt believe you could be seen this way deep in my heart felt this was indeed the creation the truth the fallacies could slap this or myself back to to where where is one ever at perhaps did not recognize this perhaps was not capable of understanding still wonderment and curiosity urged me to follow grass still grew through the cracks afterall one particular broken slab tripped me up one particular moment changed me later peered through window of mirror edging angles portrayed my own image dimensions maybe more attempting to jump into it it was then that was abruptly reminded am only flesh walk on water craig plesco miracles never experienced one waded through the murky depths my hopes and dreams were swirling about like the reverted path of an oar undercurrent made me forget my foothold sandbar turned to seaweed and sank swallowing all my dreams rising to the top at the same time something pulling me downward coughed and spat out those wishes the stream of stronger being seemed to control all of me momentarily gained some aspect of sanity and decided to float it was much easier than swimming and very safe as was pulled along sensed that my velocity and that of the current was increasing gravity my master the grand trickster those who wish to defy it inevitably give in to it in order to survive abandoning all sense of self become one with the water was water was fluid could be easily formed manipulated had no real shape crashing to the bottom of the falls knew the uniqueness gained nothing in the end things form certain qualities only temporarily permanently there is but one form striving to become is to strive for nothing drawn on craig plesco scratch in my arm was etched did it matter bruise on my head was scarred later gone nothing remembered whistled some insane prisoner type came after me with gun laughed knowing that the destruction of my being would not matter haha remember science class my matter will be an apple tree when feel your feelings when sense your touch want to be you when reach out for you you are me and scratch your arm looking down you notice it sometimes you touch it unwittingly somewhere in your mind you feel me later the scar is gone reand craig plesco rat eyes are no disguise rats live on no evil star sexton asked myself what is an evil star planets are sometimes stars people are sometimes stars flames are stars illusions are stars looking inside myself almost felt star reaching ever deeper no rats existed was there flame reaching out trying to escape erupt become hollowed like canoe sadness erupted pavement destroyed you can never see soul but if it goes with you you will carry times your load voices urging beckon come with me almost did but knew had purpose not to become that star but to give it orange marmalade craig plesco started to get buddy of my very own knew it wasnt because of her her skepticism tore me apart later tearing was my job and went into it like madman had to show her showed myself alright was her she was me after brief shower hopped out the door to the nearest convenience store it was there that my life became more meaningful showered with options life had no limitations was no caveman my club in hand walked the aisles and checked myself out in the cooler windows yeah was cool alright slick some babe looked at my jeans checked the brand and proceeded to introduce herself finding that her tastes were not acceptable dashed heh noone noticed hadnt paid only paid attention to some naivete kicked few pieces of trash out of the weeds and into the bright light of the concrete examination proved futile and seeking more adventure traveled arriving wasnt as much fun peering coollyover my rims sought meaning what was subjected to were drumsticks oh well few germs and many hours later another shower was necessary stale fetus arose thanks to me xx
