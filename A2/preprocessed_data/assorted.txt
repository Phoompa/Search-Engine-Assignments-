step but sooner or later we have to wake up the bomb is getting around guess it all right to be committed to arms control if one has nothing better to do to prattle about significant reductions and mutual verification to pin buttons on knapsacks and adopt the confused fearful expression of the truly knowledgeable and if someone compares you to an ostrich call him warmonger nothing shuts em up like the old big lie but please do nt pretend that anything can come of it the present daft declarations simply demonstrate that balminess is an equal opportunity illness whether it strikes in sweltering august or crisp november by september expect an enterprising marketeer at time or newsweek to have coined phrase something like november thaw to foretell the outcome of the forthcoming summit and afterward we will be told that this was the actual result since as every alumnus knows the observed must bow to the observer then all arms controllers can hug themselves in in the smug glow of piety praising yet another victory for that ancient force the imperious demand dashed all of it even grasping at the invisible straw of soviet compliance these facts remain india has the bomb so has france israel has the bomb and pakistan will have it soon if it has nt now china is said to have many bombs there are probably others and there certainly will be more know there will be more you see the vow has the bomb calm yourself it true the ohio chapter of the veterans of overseas wars has the bomb not too likely you ve heard about it people committed to uni or bilateral arms control do nt talk lot about the multilateral arms race or its logical conclusion what happened was this was in columbus on business the vow was in columbus for its annual convention all of us stayed at the columbus sheraton but think they enjoyed it more than did there were vowers in the room next to mine and though sure that better than having them in the same room im hardpressed to say precisely how boisterous lot one cackled like disney villain and another guffawed better than any laugh track most of their conversation was not as literate as that mind you they seemed to me to communicate mostly by yelps yowls and yahoos at any and all hours did my best to hide my pain in the room in the hallways in the elevators ick but do nt know that was entirely successful almost broke down on saturday when saw four overmadeup matrons mangling god bless america with kazoos but the real action did nt happen until sunday have you ever been to columbus suppose it very nice place to be normal be surprised if it pays to be anything other than normal sunday was the day of the columbus area gay pride march when learned of this latter datum wondered about the scheduling savvy of the vowers did nt have to wonder for long item it takes muscles to march for prideful pederasty in columbus all of the marchers were beefy meanlooking men only about 15 dared to march and one group banner was from distant pittsburg four jocktypes were mangling chariots of fire on glockenspiel brawnygaudy transvestite was clashing with them doing creditable job of am woman on kazoo heard some protest noises that sounded closer than the raindance eighteen floors below stepped onto the balcony to investigate and found assembled most of the vowers they were yelling and gesticulating wildly waving angry signs stop the commie fags ban perversion nuke jane fonda there was large oil drum hanging over the ledge of the balcony painted velvety flat black it was inscribed in white block letters cure for aids there was flabby good ol boy lounging against the guardrail grinding away slowly at chaw of tobacco he wore loosefitting wranglers and tshirt that was valliantly failing to contain his beer belly as watched he scrunched up his face and taking careful aim let fly stream of tobacco sputum below one of the marchers looked up and shook his fist hee hee said good ol boy that ll teach em ll understate myself and say was revolted my mouth was too wet and felt an urgent need to change the subject fast is that really cure for aids pointed to the oil drum hee hee said good ol boy of the vow hee hee

he sent another train of sputtle over the ledge had to turn away it ai nt armed he looked disgusted hell it ai nt even finished yet sighed with relief an ugly thought but you are going to have the bomb soon right scowl the college boys say it ll be another six months at least say we might need it before then you need the bomb boy look down there what do you see see dozen men who look like they have more fun playing softball scowl well see gang of perverts who want to kidnap my kids yes there that too but the bomb look around you boy it not just them the whole world is going up in flames unsummoned an idea from book came crashing in on me what is it they re all expecting what forms this mixture conviction of doom feigned desire for magical salvation and imperceptibly the vague taste of more furtive hope another unanswered question if the discovery of aristotle stimulated the spread of civilization has his burial stimulated its retreat why not just nuke yourselves how that nothing well the good ol boy chawed what say is it better to have bomb and not need it than to need bomb and not have it he aimed then fired another spit missile hee hee yahoo willie g2 the art of failing americans have problem they succeed too damn much we have forgotten how to fail and how to do it with grace and style people fail miserably at almost everything everyday myself fail to fly on daily basis despite much armflapping to the contrary but they do nt do it with class or respect for this great tradition of human shortcomings they are part of the british understand the entertainment value and exquisite quality of being failure britisher named stephen pile founded the notterriblygood club of great britain in 1976 the sole qualification for joining was being bad at something and the primary activities were demonstrating just how bad you are at something now why did nt bbsers think of this typical of the british to take their weaknesses and turn them into strengths mr pile went so far as to write book called the book of heroic failures from which you will see much more this book amounts to catalog of walking human disasters mostly brits but as pile says on inumerable occassions in this volume the fine citizens of usa have triumphantly cast off their celebrated success ethic and made genuine contribution to our subject given their tremendous natural talents and resources there is no reason why this pioneering country should not lead this field in time exactly the first thing we do is organize our own notterriblygood club of st louis being failures we could nt possibly be original enough to come up with our own name now for inspiration like to provide wonderful example of failing in 1947 as part of training the british destroyer hms saintes was supposed to fire at target towed by the tug buccaneer typical naval exercise showing tremendous accuracy saintes fired only one shot buccaneer of course sank quite quickly the australians have done their part too in 1803 when they proved that justice is not only blind but accidentprone as well they made three attempts to execute joseph samuels twice the rope snapped on the third attempt the rope was strong enough apparently so was mr samuels neck as pile puts it mr samuels just hung there peacefully until he and everyone else got bored since he proved unsusceptible to capital punishment he was reprieved or this more recent exciting example in dec 1971 an uruguyan field marshall called fellow general socialist the question was settled honorably with duel these two gallant soldiers managed to fire 37 rounds at each other at distance of only 25 paces neither man got scratch these incredible accomplishments are just sampling of the awesome capabilities of man to fail in utterly amazing ways with all due respect to these noble failures think bbsers can do far worse will soon be establishing subboard towards proving this and remember the example of the man who hijacked plane and demanded to be taken to detroit the stewardess told him we re already gong to detroit he said oh good he sat down and tried to look casual jolly good the kid g2 sorry your time on the system is up you are entering
