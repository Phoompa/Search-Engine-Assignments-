the little gold fish once upon time poor fisherman lived in humble cottage near the sea one day he set off as usual with his load of nets to go fishing do nt you dare come home emptyhanded shouted his nagging wife from the door down on the shore he had just thrown the nets into the sea when something glittering in the meshes caught his eye what strange fish he said to himself picking up golden yellow fish and his amazement grew when he heard the fish say these words kind fisherman let me go free the son of the sea king and if you let me go ll grant any wish you care to make alarmed at this miracle without second thought the fisherman tossed the fish back into the water but when he went home and told his wife what had happened she scolded him soundly what when the fish said your wishes could come true you should have asked it for something go back to the beach and if you see it ask for new washtub just look at the state of ours the poorman went back to the shore as soon as he called the fish it popped up from the water where you calling me here am it said the fisherman explained what his wife wanted and the fish quickly replied you were very good to me go home and you ll see that your wish has come true certain that his wife would be pleased the fisherman hurried home but the minute he opened the door his wife screeched so it really is magic fish that you allowed to go free just look at that old washtub it brand new but if that little fish has such powers you ca nt possibly be content with such miserable little wish go straight back and get it to give you new house the fisherman hurried back to the shore wonder if ll see it again hope it has nt gone away little fish little fish he began to call from the water edge here am what do you want this time he heard it ask well my wife would like can imagine remarked the fish and what does she want now big house murmured the fisherman hesitantly all right you were kind to me and you shall have your wish the fisherman lingered on the way home enjoying the feeling of making his wife happy with new house the roof of the splendid new house was already in sight when his wife rushed up to him in fury look herel now that we know how really powerfull this fish is we ca nt be content with only house we must ask for more run back and ask for real palace not an ordinary house like this one and fine clothes and jewels too the fisherman was quite upset however he had been henpecked for so many years that he was unable to say no so he trudged back to the waters edge full of doubts he called the little fish but it was some time before it leapt from waves in the meantime the sea had begun to foam sorry to trouble you again but my wife has had second thoughts and she like fine palace and and also again the little fish granted fisherman his wishes but he seemed less friendly than before at last relieved at having been able to see his wife desires fulfilled the good fisherman turned homewards home was now magnificent palace how wonderful it was at the top of flight of steps leading to the palace stood his wife dressed like great lady and dripping with jewels impatiently waiting for him go back and ask for but the fisherman broke in what such fine palace we must be content with what we have do nt you think that asking too much go back said do as you re told and ask the fish to make me an empress the poor fisherman set off unhappily for the seashore in the meantime storm had blown up the sky was black and terrible flashes of lightning lit the darkness while the waves crashed angrily on the beach kneeling on the rock amidst the spray in low voice the fisherman began to call the little fish and when it came he told it his wife latest request but this time after listening in silence the little gold fish disappeared beneath the waves without saying word and though the fisherman waited the little fish never came back great flash of lightning much brighter than all the others lit up the sky and the fisherman saw that both the new house and the palace had vanished without trace the humble old cottage stood where it had always been but this time his wife was waiting for him in tears it serves you right we should have been pleased with what we had instead of always asking for more grumbled the fisherman angrily but in the depths of his heart he was glad that everything had gone back to normal next day and every day he went back to his fishing but he never saw the little goldfish again
