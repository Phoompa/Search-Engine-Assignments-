this is shareware trial project it is not freeware we need your support to continue 100 west by 53 north by jim prentice copyright 1990 jim prentice brandon manitoba canada north of 53 magic phrase spoken mumbled or thought inwardly by thousands of souls venturing northward an imaginary line shown only on maps and labelled 53 degrees it presence indicated to highway travellers by road side signs division of territory as distinct in the mind as any international border if you have not been north of 53 you have not been north travellers and writers poets and pilots have contributed to the lore of the north the rigors of life in the bush are told in tales of man eating mosquitoes of murderous hordes of black flies of the lumps of flesh carried away by the giant bull dog flies the stories of record breaking trout walleye and pike are legion there are tales of sights and sounds heard deep in the spruce forests the crashing of moose tearing through brush and breaking down trees the drumming of grouse the incessant hum of insects the cackling quackery of ducks feeding on quiet ponds and placid bays once heard the intermittent song of the loon is never forgotten it voice the signature of authenticity of northern scene if the wildlife in the northern bush land seems different than found elsewhere so is the life of man it takes special breed of person to live in the north the farther one travels the more this becomes apparent the southerner whether on his first or fiftieth trip north of 53 never really becomes aware of the implications of northern living generally the owners of cottages on southern lakes have more amenities at hand for weekend of roughing it than most northern dwellers have on year round basis the modern cabin on lake shore near large metropolitan center is equipped with electric service telephone paved roads natural gas pipelines and cable television nearby are services that provide food fuel repairs and entertainment drivein theaters and fast food chains abound waterfront businesses have docks built for those arriving by boat to do their shopping laundry or to transfer suitcases from the family car the local merchants deliver goods to the cabin by road or by water entrepreneurs make businesss of servicing and maintaining cabins during the owners absence in the off seasons most of these cottages whether on the lake shore or located five well paved streets from the water rival the homes of many city dwellers these lake side communities although seasonal differ little from the urban living from which they offer escape look at an average northern community study and compare the standards with those of urban areas and their nearby lake side retreats there are no local bus services if the car doesnt start you either walk or call taxi yes most areas do have taxi service of one kind or another even if it ride in the back of some one pick up truck mail delivery is unknown pleasant stroll in midsummer is contrasted by an ordeal in life threatening conditions during winter house to house delivery of milk and bread is nonexistent perhaps newspapers are delivered but it requires family effort especially in winter bus rail and scheduled air services to nearby settlements is severely restricted if available at all many small taxi companies exist because of the large fares collected in the transport of natives to and from the reserves although diminishing in recent years the bushpilot and charter aircraft still play large role in northern transportation the pilots of these small aircraft learn to live with conditions that would keep their southern colleagues on the ground in summer they fly float equipped aircraft they are busy hauling trappers fishermen freight fish furs and supplies to and from the reserves fish camps traplines logging areas and small settlements in the fall when the ice is too thin for skis yet too thick for floats they change the aircraft to wheel equipment changing to skis when ice conditions permit winter flying presents problems that most pilots never hear of temperatures exceeding 40 below zero blowing snow ice crystals and whiteouts all these challenge the pilot in their daily work the preheating of engines to coax them to life the problem of congealed oil in propeller pitch mechanisms and fueling with super cooled gasoline are regular chores the skiequipped aircraft must be tied down with ropes that are frozen into holes in the four foot ice the skis must be lifted or run onto boards or poles to prevent them freezing into the ice pilots and passengers must wear heavy arctic clothing as few aircraft have cabin heat systems capable of coping with the cold aircraft batteries are removed at the end of each day of flying to ensure maximum efficiency the next day wings and engines are covered to stop the ingress of snow and the build up of frost on the flight surfaces gasoline fueled blowpots are often carried to provide engine preheat to ensure starting the oil in these engines gets so thick at minus 40 to 50 degrees that the engine can not be turned this writer has done chinups on the propeller of coldsoaked cessna which flew the next day after preheating the northern airports lack any degree of services in comparison to those farther south fuel is usually available if you can locate the operator some of the larger communities may have pay telephone at the airstrip but the normal procedure is to buzz the town on arrival this lets the people know you are landing and usually someone will head out to the strip to meet you unless you are regular customer all transactions for fuel and oil are on cash basis cheques are nearly useless in village without bank credit to stranger is foolhardy during the grip of winter the snowmobile is the major mode of transport in all but the largest of settlements in many places that do have roads in winter vehicles are left running 24 hours day if allowed to get cold it may take many hours of effort to restart balky engines most northern residents enjoy the winter months the change in seasons brings on change in activities the boats and motors are stored away with the lawnmowers and garden chairs the snowmobiles are tuned up icefishing shacks are towed onto lakes and rivers the blades of gas powered ice augers are sharpened the fishermen flock to their favorite spots and drill holes through ice up to four feet thick whether in the comfort of shack with woodburning stove glowing in the center or huddled on the ice in the lee of snowmobile they normally take good catch walleye trout pike tullibee and whitefish as well as perch burbot catfish and bass are plentiful the most popular bait is minnows some use suckerbelly or net bags of trout eggs others use metal spoons or large bucktail flies leadheaded jigging lures or just snelled hooks as in summer the best bait is whatever the fish are taking at the time moose hunting is another favorite sport especially in the colder weather when the moose are on the move for food and warmth the hunter faces problems similar to the pilot with his equipment the extreme temperatures require that his snowmachine be kept in top condition if it is to start after day of hunting once started it must be dependable life and death situation could develop if the machine breaks down while 40 or 50 miles from home even his rifle requires special care bolt covered with heavy grease will freeze solid in the cold the firing pin may not move when struck by the hammer many moose and bear lived to face another day because hunter weapon failed to operate other outdoor activities include cross country skiing snowmobiling and racing dog teams these sports are included in the many winter festivals held each year as spring arrives the winter equipment is stored away and once again the boats and motors are brought out wagers are made on the time and date of the break up of river ice the snow blowers shovels and skidoo suits are replaced with lawn mowers rakes and bathing suits the pussy willows blossom the ducks and geese return from their winter feeding grounds in the southern usa the frogs begin to croak and the first battalions of mosquitoes are hatched from the winter lows of 40 below zero the mercury climbs upward the summer highs reach the 90 sometimes 100 degrees fantastic differential of 140 degrees between seasons through the seasons day to day life continues the sport and commercial fishing the trapping and hunting the road building home construction and landscaping the pilots fly passengers and freight they fly patrols on hundreds of miles of hydroelectric transmission lines and forest fire patrols at regular intervals they carry conservationists doing animal census they transport tanks of baby fish to restock the lakes the seriously ill or injured are taken to medical centers by medevac flights other flights carry fishermen and tourists prospectors vie with geologists botanists biologists entomologists and surveyors all use the aircraft to see touch smell measure and record the wonders of the north the opening day of each hunting or fishing season is heralded by the arrival of recreational vehicles of all types trailers and vans motorhomes and 4x4 arrive daily they carry or tow boats and motors bicycles motorcycles and atvs the firsttimers fill the private and provincial government campgrounds the more experienced and adventuresome travel logging roads and bush trails to favorite lakes rivers and streams in town the streets and parking lots are crammed with vehicles and equipment gasoline food booze and fishing equipment are sold in great quantities the hotels are full reservations were made months in advance some were made prior to leaving the year before for few short weeks during the prime spring fishing period every available camping spot is occupied as the summer wears on the sportsmen recede and tourists take their place the cycle repeats annually each year number of travellers arrive in privately owned aircraft piper cub to beechcraft taildragger to bizjet most have been here before to some it is new experience to southern pilot trip north can be unnerving accustomed to flying over network of roads and railroad tracks always in contact with an airport or navigation aid they are seldom prepared for the realities of northern flight airports are hundreds of miles apart in most cases there are no roads or railways for navigation at lower altitudes voice contact with an airport is an exception rather than the rule flight plans of course are mandatory map reading is difficult there are so many lakes many of them the same basic shape that sharp eye must be kept on the map for seaplanes the ever present danger of logs rocks and reefs is amplified by the distance from civilization flights must be carefully planned around suitable refueling facilities the pilot of private seaplane is in his own element here the pleasure of landing on remote lake its quiet green waters undisturbed by others is indescribable after securing the aircraft and setting up camp the true beauty of the north can be enjoyed waters teeming with fish are surrounded by wildlife of all types the smells of wood smoke and coffee mingling with the sound of fresh fish sizzling in the frypan the songs of bird life the cry of the loon the evening wail of coyotes and wolves the whistle of wings as ducks geese ravens hawks and eagles travel down the shoreline on the lakes are the wakes of passing beaver and muskrat the occasional warning smack of beaver tail on the water as he senses danger the varied hues of trees evergreen and deciduous the colors of windflowers the taste of fresh wild strawberries raspberries and blueberries the excitement of an evening sky dancing with dazzling display as the aurora borealis appears the northern lights are surrounded by stars incredibly brilliant against the black smog free heavens thoughts in the night lying in your tent you hear rustling noises twig snaps mouse or rabbit moose or bear is the food secure you visualize the food bundle securely tied to tree branch high above the ground the wind is rising you can hear small waves breaking on the shore is the airplane alright should you go and check it what will the fishing be like in the morning will you get another chance to land the big walleye that you lost to day or bigger one lone mosquito buzzes your ear somehow he has penetrated the netting of your tent the cry of loon is the last thing you hear you sleep peacefully until the songs of early morning bird life announce the start of new day but for the constant buzzstingslap of insect warfare you might be in heaven far to the south your friends and neighbors are also facing new day howling dogs screaming kids squealing tires the wail of police and fire sirens the reek of diesel fumes from passing trucks and busses telephones jangle and typewriters clatter the work piles up dissatisfied customers grumble the boss looms threateningly they jostle in line for bus then for coffee then for lunch they fight traffic to get home the neighbor dog has left deposit on the lawn the children toys are cluttering the driveway they sit down to tv dinner and discuss your crazy fishing trip the day to day life in the north does have its problems if you happen to own car for which there is no local dealer you may have to order parts from hundreds of miles away and have them shipped in by bus or plane meanwhile the car sits the same applies to appliances tools and so on there may not be tv repairman in town you must send the set out for repairs or buy new one by mail order of course providing your community has tv station to begin with most northern communities have only one radio station the cbc some are augmented by local programming other services may be difficult to obtain for example veterinarian may visit weekly or monthly or not at all medical facilities are usually present to some extent but any serious illness or injury may require medevac flight to distant city fresh meat and produce become more of problem in the more remote areas if road or rail service exists the problem is not too acute however in many communities the only access is by air in this event the shipment of perishable commodities is dependant on space available on the aircraft the subsequent prices reflect the added cost of the product on the subject of costs heating home with propane may be five to seven times the cost of natural gas as in southern homes food gasoline clothing and appliances are considerably more expensive in the north of course the more remote the location the higher the price on trip into the high arctic few years ago the prices ran like this hotel bed 10000 per night per man breakfast eggs toast bacon and coffee 1200 avgas 700 per gallon but then when you are 250 miles north of the arctic circle you expect to pay higher prices why then do people live in the north for the natives it is matter of ancestry for many whites it is also ancestry to some they were born there their parents having moved north for employment reasons some are transients following construction jobs and other seasonal employment others working for large corporations or government are transferred north as job requirement life in the north is definitely different person accustomed to life in large city may not endure the rigors involved they give it up and move south many people such as myself move north for an extended period in our case it was 10 years we adapted to the way of life we enjoyed the hunting and fishing owning our own aircraft we were able to travel more independently than our neighbors we enjoyed all the great outdoors had to offer we learned to adjust to the lack of night life and other amenities when 10 years had passed and our children were adults we took stock of our situation we were stuck in rut the same rut that most of the townspeople were in our lives centered around hunting fishing the post office and the tv set we decided it was case of moving now or possibly remaining in the north for the rest of our lives we left in february of 1984 we miss the delicious fresh fish from cold clear lakes we miss the taste of thick moose steaks moosemeat sausages fresh smoked lake trout and pancakes with fresh wild blueberries we miss the freedom afforded by short flight to secluded lake shore the fishing and hunting within 10 miles of our northern home was superb the friendship and camaraderie of our neighbors was great we are happy to have had the opportunity to experience northern life but as we approached the midpoint of our lives we wanted to return to civilization to pick up where we had left off to enjoy the supermarkets and shopping malls the fancy restaurants and gourmet foods we wanted to be closer to the center of things few hours drive from major city rather than an all day trip we returned to old friends and new neighbors new stores and home mail delivery lower prices broader choices more to do and see more tv channels several radio stations and newspapers we can drive east or west besides north and south we can dance to live music and eat in restaurants of many nationalities in short we are back to civilization the end 214
