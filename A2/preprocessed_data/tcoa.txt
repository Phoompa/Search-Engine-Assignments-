internet wiretap edition of the cask of amontillado by edgar allan poe from the works of edgar allan poe tales vol lippincott co copyright 1895 this text is placed into the public domain may 1993 the cask of amontillado the thousand injuries of fortunato had borne as best could but when he ven tured upon insult vowed revenge you who so well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that gave utterance to threat at length would be avenged this was point de finitively settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk must not only punish but punish with impunity wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had given fortunato cause to doubt my good will continued as was my wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation he had weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his connoisseur ship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise impos ture upon the british and austrian millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his country men was quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this respect did not differ from him materially was skilful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever could it was about dusk one evening during the su preme madness of the carnival season that encoun tered my friend he accosted me with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley he had on tightfitting partistriped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells was so pleased to see him that thought should never have done wringing his hand said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably well you are look ing today but have received pipe of what passes for amontillado and have my doubts how said he amontillado pipe im possible and in the middle of the carnival have my doubts replied and was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and was fearful of losing bargain amontillado have my doubts amontillado and must satisfy them amontillado as you are engaged am on my way to luchesi if any one has critical turn it is he he will tell me luchesi can not tell amontillado from sherry and yet some fools will have it that his taste is match for your own come let us go whither to your vaults my friend no will not impose upon your good nature perceive you have an engagement luchesi have no engagement come my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which perceive you are af flicted the vaults are insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he can not distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on mask of black silk and drawing roquelaire closely about my person suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time had told them that should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufficient well knew to insure their immediate disappear ance one and all as soon as my back was turned took from their sconces two flambeaux and giv ing one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults passed down long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode the pipe said he it is farther on said but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of in toxication nitre he asked at length nitre replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes it is nothing he said at last come said with decision we will go back your health is precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as once was you are man to be missed for me it is no matter we will go back you will be ill and can not be responsible besides there is luchesi enough he said the cough is mere nothing it will not kill me shall not die of cough true true replied and indeed had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps here knocked off the neck of bottle which drew from long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould drink said presenting him the wine he raised it to his lips with leer he paused and nodded to me familiarly while his bells jingled drink he said to the buried that repose around us and to your long life he again took my arm and we proceeded these vaults he said are extensive the montresors replied were great numerous family forget your arms huge human foot dor in field azure the foot crushes serpent rampant whose fangs are im bedded in the heel and the motto nemo me impune lacessit good he said the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of the catacombs paused again and this time made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow the nitre said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the vaults we are below the river bed the drops of moisture trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your cough it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of the medoc broke and reached him flagon of de grave he emptied it at breath his eyes flashed with fierce light he laughed and threw the bottle up wards with gesticulation did not understand looked at him in surprise he repeated the movement grotesque one you do not comprehend he said not replied then you are not of the brotherhood how you are not of the masons yes yes said yes yes you impossible mason mason replied sign he said it is this answered producing trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire you jest he exclaimed recoiling few paces but let us proceed to the amontillado be it so said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed through range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame at the most remote end of the crypt there ap peared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault over head in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three sides of this interior crypt were still orna mented in this manner from the fourth the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point mound of some size within the wall thus exposed by the displac ing of the bones we perceived still interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavoured to pry into the depths of the recess its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see proceed said herein is the amontillado as for luchesi he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily forward while followed immediately at his heels in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly be wildered moment more and had fettered him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one of these depended short chain from the other padlock throwing the links about his waist it was but the work of few seconds to secure it he was too much astounded to re sist withdrawing the key stepped back from the recess pass your hand said over the wall you can not help feeling the nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore you to return no then must positively leave you but must first render you all the little attentions in my power the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his astonishment true replied the amontillado as said these words busied myself among the pile of bones of which have before spoken throw ing them aside soon uncovered quantity of build ing stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of my trowel began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in great measure worn off the earliest in dication had of this was low moaning cry from the depth of the recess it was not the cry of drunken man there was then long and obstinate silence laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then heard the furious vibrations of the chain the noise lasted for several minutes during which that might hearken to it with the more satisfaction ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones when at last the clanking sub sided resumed the trowel and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon level with my breast again paused and holding the flam beaux over the masonwork threw few feeble rays upon the figure within succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back for brief moment hesitated trembled unsheathing my rapier began to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured me placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the cata combs and felt satisfied reapproached the wall replied to the yells of him who clamoured re echoed aided surpassed them in volume and in strength did this and the clamourer grew still it was now midnight and my task was drawing to close had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier had finished portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but single stone to be fitted and plastered in struggled with its weight placed it partially in its destined position but now there came from out the niche low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was succeeded by sad voice which had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble fortunato the voice said ha ha ha he he very good joke indeed an excellent jest we will have many rich laugh about it at the palazzo he he he over our wine he he he the amontillado said he he he he he he yes the amon tillado but is it not getting late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest let us be gone yes said let us be gone for the love of god montresor yes said for the love of god but to these words hearkened in vain for reply grew impatient called aloud fortunato no answer called again fortunato no answer still thrust torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within there came forth in return only jingling of the bells my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs hastened to make an end of my labour forced the last stone into its position plastered it up against the new masonry re erected the old rampart of bones for the half of century no mortal has disturbed them in pace requiescat end
