the red dragon once there was time thousands of years ago when animals were not the same as they are now except for few like the lion the tiger and the butterflies they all looked alike all were more or less the same height everyone had four legs and it was nt easy to tell which was which even though the elephant did weigh more than the hyena and the hippo more than the gazelle one day while all the animals were relaxing in field along came red dragon out of breath crying we re in danger folks the world is about to come to an end how do you know everyone asked the dragon replied read it in the stars we must escape but where can we go they asked him to another world he replied ll take you there can fly and ll take you to planet that is safer than this one frightened as they were all the animals climbed on to the dragon back with bored look the lion said not scared of anything so ll just stay here on earth the others however were fighting to get on the dragons back do nt push you behind shouted the crocodile hey move that paw it was just like people today pushing and shoving to get onto an overcrowded train at last the dragon cried ready off we go and started to run for takeoff the first and the second runs were nt fast enough but at the third try he finally got off the ground flapping his wings and waving his tail not so fast shouted somebody and another voice yelled faster or we will end up in the trees the dragon replied oh bother doing the best can why do nt you lot keep still for once the fact was that because they were frightened they did everything but keep still and so after while the poor red dragon now very tired simply could not flap his wings any longer and crashed on lovely green meadow all the animals shrieked with terror nobody lost his life but the snake lost his legs and slithered away through the grass the rhino bumped his head and grew horn all the elephant teeth fell out except for two which became very long the giraffe sprained his neck and it grew to great length the hippo rolled about so much he became nearly round ended up in pond and did nt come out he was too ashamed to be seen well in that fall all the animals took on different appearance and became what they are today and when the lion saw them what he said was oh how funny you look
