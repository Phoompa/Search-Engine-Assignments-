eyes were unfocused and stared into nothingness he was of medium height muscular deeply tanned with scraggly grey moustache and beard father adler was dressed in the black shirt black pants and silver boots of rhubidium miner tied around his neck was small leather pouch of type that would have held gunpowder on an earth of untold eons in the past this pouch however was reputed to hold earth from earth no one knew for certain of course two attributes of father adler were most striking and they were qualities one sensed rather than observed directly one was was his age which in spite of his physical appearance was believed to be very old perhaps measured in centuries most of us who have talked with father adler agree on this although it is an intuitive perception shared by many no one dares to ask him how old he really is father adler temper is legendary as is his skill with carbonium long knife several murders in bar fights are part of his story although such events are hardly uncommon in the lawless frontier mining towns of the resource planets in the twelfth quadrant the other characteristic of father adler that one senses intuitively is his wounded soul great sadness melancholy and torment radiate outward from his being it is strange to recognize that such feelings dominate man whose reputation for feats of great courage physical stamina and violence is well attested nonetheless there it is and all agree it is very real this terrifying awesome legend seems to be slowly dying inside from great sadness pain and unknown demons needless to say the speculation in the bars dives and brothels of the twelfth quadrant never ceases who is father adler if the legend is true he appeared one day several centuries ago in the mining town of belitsheri on prisca looking for work as rhubidium chopper dangerous suicidal occupation if there ever was one if those stories are true father adler looked exactly as he does today if those tales are true he is as old as dacian yet he travels between the stars as we all do in any case who has ever heard of male dacian what could torment this man of awesome physical and intellectual powers he seems to carry no guilt over those he has killed he is treated with great respect and deference by all women are hardly problem all ages races and varieties flock to his side and many share his bed most seem to actually like him what torments him then an unspeakable unmentionable foul crime lost love had father adler once upon time loved deeply commitedly and then lost the object of such passions the very idea seems preposterous the bar where fadler adler was drinking and daydreaming was the bragi in the mining town of celine on the resource planet vasa the bragi was legendary both for the potency of its drinks and the quality of its fights the walls were panelled in factory reject rhubidium as befitted the best watering hole in the richest mining town in the galaxy the floors tables and bar top were highly polished cratagus wood the bartender was an old friend of father adler tygor by the name of sam xi seven feet tall with flowing black hair green skin and both nose and gills sam presented terryifying appearance however within the usual realm of daily life sam was the gentlest of souls he has been happily married to the same woman for forty years and was the father of three gorgeous if somewhat tall daughters the bar girls of the bragi were in class by themselves their beauty was unsurpassed and the pleasures they offered were hardly confined to the drinks they served on this particular saturday evening the bragi was in its usual state of alcoholic and sexual bedlam father adler sat in the middle of it all oblivious to the maelstrom swirling around him it was stiffling hot this late summer night and the ceiling fans provided little relief aroudn 10 pm the doors to the bragi burst open and blast of steaming hot air blew across the saloon in strode oriana the dacian companion of the fabled oracular unicorn of kushanah she was clad tightly in gold but it was dull gold that neither gleamed nor shone shirt pants and boots had neither sheen nor sparkle her golden hair which fell to her waist in straight lines did shine in the semigloom of the bragi and her purple eyes caught and reflected what little light was available the darkness hid her disfigured face and the scars that crisscrossed across her right eye and down her throat everyone bar maids hookers waiters miners off duty military personnel and assorted nameless rifffaff fell silent and stared all had heard of oriana for she was living immortal myth they knew every detail of her appearance but only two had every seen her in the flesh sam and father adler sam studiously wiped the spotlessly clean counter and refused to look up at the dacian as she strode in father adler sipping his beer at the bar with his back to the door did not even turn around oriana strode up to father adler stopped few feet from his back and spoke softly with great warmth jared great evil is loose in the galaxy we need you once again no answer no movement jared we need you all sentient beings need you come father adler took another sip of his beer but still did not turn around jared please think of others your own concerns are nothing now they need you jaredfather adler swivelled slowly on his bar stool and faced the dacian an incredible expression upon his face of hate and love anguish and torment the bragi was so quiet you could have heard varangian fly cough get lost oriana hissed jared jared please need you oriana voice could barely be heard she attempted to lay her right hand on jareds but he quickly withdrew his arm another beer sam the tygor was now staring at the dacian directly hard and without fear he refilled jared mug jared love you tear flowed from oriana disfigured eye down her cheek love you you bitch jared nearly bellowed you love me do you if that is nt the most perverse joke in the quadrant jared do oh shut up ve taken lot from you over the centuries but this tops it all you love me kinder to those kill than you ve been to me do you call your response to me on kushanah love jared was standing now his nose an inch from oriana face tears streamed down her face sam stared at the two of them in his odd intense detached way everyone else in the bragi was transfixed was the mystery of father adler about to be unravelled you do nt love anyone but yourself and that damned unicorn you use people like pawns like furniture and to what ends the gods only know you use them icily and then fling them away like flies or matchsticks you my dear are the ultimate power hungry vicious manipulator of souls beautiful beyond words sensual and erotic beyond any man wildest

throat the crowd gasped jared do nt hissed sam stay out of this old friend said jared softly oriana closed her eyes kill me then jared she whispered kill me if you can jared put the point of his knife on her adam apple and pushed slightly trickle of the dacian purple blood ran down her throat no one dared move or speak the knife clattered to the floor as jared slumped back on the bar stool he covered his face with his hands and cried softly oriana moved to him and put her arms around his waist and buried her face against his shoulder my dearest love my only love do still love you yes have done horrible things to you treated your love at times with coldness and contempt wanting to break you or drive you insane have done all those things and truly deserve your complete hate even death if that were possible but do love you and the nature of my love is true and real the quality and torment of my love is partially your fault my dear and you know it you taught me what it is to love what such feelings and emotions are no dacian has every loved has ever felt love and you know that it is believed we are incapable of such emotions they are held to be literally genetically beyond our grasp and potential can you ever imagine the fear you instilled my heart oriana voice was barely audible and she still wept slowly jared now hugged her and rocked her gently as one would child his eyes closed oriana sniffled and wiped her nose on jareds sleeve you see my love you showed me how to be love but you also gave me the gift of fear can you ever understand what it is like to know fear and be immortal no can not do that sighed jared no one could it seems also gave you the gift of loneliness oriana sniffled into his shirt again it were best we had never met wish was dead for what ve done to you now none of that would nt trade my love for you for anything in the universe absolutely would not but er could we try for little less pain and abuse over the next century perhaps love you

filled the room sam blew his nose loudly in an enormous hankerchief jared you have nt said that you would come oriana stepped back from him hands on her hips and mischievous grin on her face of course

them and begain to toy with the buttons on his shirt she kissed him lightly then turned around to face the awestruck staring crowd and did most undacian thing oriana pressed her palms together and bowed slightly towards those facing her thank you thank you for bearing witness thank you for being patient with two overage children jared was so surprised at hearing this that fly flew in his open mouth and made him cough every man woman and child in the bragi would now have followed oriana into the pits of hell itself and you old friend oriana now turned towards the tygor can we get you away from that lovely wife and three beautiful daughters we should be in for one hell of fight oriana flashed her most captivating smile at sam and he grinned back orry ve been true blue family man for any

equipment ll be there oriana took jared hand and walked slowly towards the door broad grin upon her beautiful yet devastated face jared glanced around at the bragi as if taking it all in for the last time and winked at few friends in the crowd sam smiled paternally when they reached the door someone in the back yelled out good luck you bastard and everyone laughed
