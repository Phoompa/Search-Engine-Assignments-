the coffee shop atmosphere was too much for harvey nelson observing his surroundings he saw nothing but smokey room full of old folks it had reached eleven oclock in this small ohio town and the lunchtime crowd was just begining to shuffle in harvey took another glance at the daily paper he was holding he had gone to law school for two years but dropped out after the mounting tensions between his parental units and himself caused him to move out in an attempt to allay the matter he spent the last six months of his life in this hellhole of town answering odd jobs which were found on the corkboard by the cash register in the hardware store by word of mouth or in the local paper harvey went through this time friendless and without hearing single word from his parents he loved that part as he simply could not get along with people it seemed as if everyone in his life was just trying to get him down he liked the current tranquility of his life and who knows maybe he get enough money together by winter to continue school living here was okay he paid rent for an apartment in the center of town it had tv bath bedroom and best of all cheap price he had an old plymouth real jalopy but it got him where he was going this morning he had seen an ad in the town rag for cleanup help the ad plainly read help wanted for building cleanup 75 call vivian canburn 965o394 after answering the phone she gave him directions to the building and told him to be there at noon he looked at the clock on the wall eleven twentyfour pretty soon he be leaving he sat there for while staring blankly at his dull surroundings the people he saw did nt seem to have any real purpose for their diurnal actions but rather sadly acted out their motions to pass time harvey thought about this and suddenly realized that he did nt want to live long enough to become old at noon he pulled into the building lot from state route 18 definitely on the outskirts of town the cement was cracked and needed repaving and the lawn was unmowed musty buick lay parked on the other side of the building he saw vivian canburn shriveled elderly woman standing next to the building entrance as he walked up to greet her he noticed the building lack of upkeep it was sturdy structure but the windows were dirty and it appeared mostly untouched for many years it was once clothing store but it closed in 1977 the woman had suprisingly youthful voice and it has nt been occupied since harvey asked no when the store closed my husband was going to rent it out but he passed away she paused you must be harvey yes and you are miss canburn he asked ignoring his question she unlocked the front door just had an inquiry about the building last week and the fellow seems interested its important that it looks nice she said stepping inside she fondled the side wall in search of the light switch think it on this side almost sure of it with that the lights went on had the power turned back on yesterday was little nervous about everything working having the lawn mowed by little johnny alberton tommorow morning she said do you know johnny he such nice little boy the old woman poked around in the room it was large tiled room with white painted walls there were water stains down the back end of the right wall and the paint was chipping in some areas there was dust everywhere and it sure looked like it needed good cleaning there was door in the back of the room that leads to bathroom storage closet and an office room if recall correctly it should take you good four or five hours maybe longer do you have any questions he thought for moment no can start right away brought everything need in my car she answered him that great ll leave the front door open while you get your things it will lock when it closed when you are done go across the street over there she pointed to an old stone house good summer walk down the road alright he answered her putting his cleaning materials into the threshold there dumpster in the back vivian said as she walked past him she went into her car eased it down the driveway and left harvey walked inside it looked like easy work for seventyfive bucks but the air was so musty he could hardly stand it he propped the front door open with small twig wishing that some of the wispy july air would wash in as he bent over to pick up his broom small spider lowered itself from its web on the ceiling corner harvey paused to look at it am lot stronger than you are buddy he said with torturous grin he slowly took his dustpan in hand and eased it down on the unsuspecting creature it was instantly transformed into yellow smear on the floor getting up he proceeded to sweep the floor the dust was quite thick as the floor had not been walked on in years he felt sort of spooky inexplainable feeling being the first manlike beast to tread on it in such seemingly long stretch of time as he swept out corner the webs of spider home clung to the broom strands he saw quartersized spider scuttle up the wall damn those things hate them he thought he blocked the spider path with the broom when it hit the ground he swept it into the pile of dirt and dust it crawled out he swept it in again again it walked out the broom came down upon the arachnid again and again the arachnid crawled away harvey played this game of inout inout few more times before he just stepped on the damned thing hah he felt surge of glee the rest of the room was swept with few more barefaced encounters with the creatures all of which ultimately ended with the death of the lesser being he soon had enough dust debris and insect remnants to fill trash bag the room looked almost useable now as he took the garbage bag out to the dumpster in the back lot of the building the bucolic woods and sylvan songs put his mind to thinking of his present bodily location good distance from town he noticed an intricately crafted spider web nested along the back of the dumpster with arms slowly stretching up the brick wall of the building he did nt mess with it or give the sight any more thought than quick shudder walking back into the building he let the door close behind him locking in place he proceeded to clean the bathrooms moving his detergents and supplies to the back hallway he was able to get through this without much thought although he worked up an uncomfortable sweat an air conditioning vent gaped at him from the top of the wall it was on probably controlled with the lighting but it only emitted an uncomfortable mixture of heat and dust hmm gon na have to check out the main duct he thought he moved on to what once was an office room the carpeted floor had faint snowfall of webbing on it he did not see any of those demonic beasts of nature but rather large variety of flies and cockroaches dried up and empty void of their internal lifefluids his previous feelings of twisted joy now transformed into fiery passion lusting after each and every spiders demise he walked across the room and over the spiders victims their hollow shells crunching like potatoe chips being eaten
