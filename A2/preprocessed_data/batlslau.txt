rpgnet aolcom dec 11993 below you will find the rules that my friends and have come up with for battletech these rules were meant to augment the existing rules not replace them the battletech compendium is the ruleook referenced throughout this text and is considered necessary for these rules to be used fully one of the basic assumptions throughout this entire text is that the clans do not exist granted some of the technology presented in here is clan in nature or capability but this system was started before the clans were presented the history of the battletech universe has also been ignored completely this is evident with the huge variety of weapons and the fact that for example lbx autocannons weigh more than standard autocannons for any system that is not specifically modifed or covered in these rules assume that the standard rules for inner sphere systems take precedence the 2x engine rules were created some time ago exact date forgotten these rules are of my design and should be considered copyrighted the observer rules were created based upon ideas found in the recgamesmecha archives credit is given at the end the internal structure and armor rules were developed recently and are pretty much an adjustment to existing rules plus added systems if anything appears to have come from fasa then it probably did the weapons list is compilation of the existing weapons plus those developed by myself my friends and others the alternate ammunitions were an outgrowth of rules presented in the fasa product unbound and material found in the aforementioned archives the infantry rules were developed to make all types of infantry viable selection these rules were also intened to make them little more capable of playing role on the battlefield the credit section is where give credit to those who inspired me to put something resembling their work into my compilation tried to give credit where it is due but if you feel slighted apologize one source of inspiration and information tht is not credited there is fasa they deserve the credit for anything that resembles material from the rulebook and the product unbound if you have any questions comments or suggestions feel free to send email to murraymd udavxbocaudaytonedu or matt murray 144 medford apt dayton oh 45410 enjoy the 2xeng and 2xeng2xcockpit mech rules will require that you make new mech sheets for these monsters with little bit of work clear tape and photocopies you can cut up you can make the sheets no problem ll give you what location has how many crits of each thing engine mechs the two engine mech is simply battlemech that has such high speed that the weight or power requirements are so high that two engines are requird as opposed to one for mech to have two engines it must pass one of two requirements if it does nt then the mech will simply use one engine note the weight requirements below are based upon standard engine weights and are regardless of the possibility of the engines being st or xl engines for the design of your mech replace the rules for determine engine weight with this list detremine the speed of the mech determine the engine rating determine the engine weight check to see if steps or qualify the mech for 2x engine status if the mech does qualify follow ths steps if the last digit of the engine rating is add to the engine rating making it an even number divide the engine rating by creating the engine ratings of the smaller engines to be used use the smaller engine ratings to determine the engine weights of the two smaller engines modify the weights of the engines appropriately if you are going to use st or xl engines add the weights of the engines together to determine the final weight of th engines note gyro weight is based upon the engine rating from line 4a requirements if the mech is 55100 tons then the requirements are the required engine rating is above 400 or the weight of the engine required is 75 or greater than the weight of the mech if the mech is 550 tons then the requirements are the required engine rating is above 400 or the weight of the engine required is 50 or greater than the weight of the mech now that the rules for what mechs are allowed to have engines have been established next are the special rules pertaining to them since the mech has fusion engines it also has 20 heat sinks they can be made double heat sinks the number of hs that can be put on to an engine wout being represented on the critical hit table is based upon the engine rating of each engine not the combined engine ratings if the engine heat sinks are double hs then divide the number of heat sinks that can be put on an engine by the number of crits each double heat sink takes up this rule is put in so that double heat sinks are not common and do not unbalance the game since heat is the restraining factor in this game this rule is also under the assumption that the rules concerning mixing standard and double heat sinks are changed if you want to you can mount double and standard hs on mech all of the heat sinks from the engines must be the same type all 20 must be either double or standard not half half if you keep the original rule saying all heat sinks must be the same type then you may also consider possibly ignore this subrule completely damage track is kept for each engine it is possible for 2x engine mech to recieve engine hits per engine when one of the two engines receives hits it is destroyed and the move rate of the mech is halved rounding down the destroyed engine also stops producing heat due to damage or moving 2x engine mech is considered destroyed when both engines are destroyed ie when each engine has received engine hits any hs mounted on the engine and not represented on the crit hit table for the mech are also destroyed when the internal structure for side torso has been completely destroyed that sides engine is also counted as destroyed with the appropriate effects for losing one engine as outlined in rule the critical hit table for 2x engined mech is different from that you would find on standard one change the center torso by changing all engine slots 111213222324 into empty slots that can mount equipment change both of the side torsos to this slot configuration standard st engines xl engines engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine engine as you can see you have high to 100 chance of getting an engine hit with the more advanced engines if the engines are going to use st or xl technology both must be of the same type the heat produced from movement is doubled with 2x engine mechs walking heat is while running produces heat as before regardless of technology level of the engine each engine requires only engine hits to be destroyed design notes on 2x engine mechs these rules were written long before the clans came into the picture they were even written before the rules for xl engines were published from the time we came out with the rules for 2x engine mechs we have experimented with rules for 2x engine tanks we never goofed with aerospace fighters but that would be another logical growth of the rules the rules we developed never did seem balanced and seemed to require major rewrite of the tank rules which we did for some areas if you desire to have 2x engine tanks you may want to take long hard look at them realize that the limiting factors for 2x engine mechs are loss of internal space loss of armor protection for the engines due to sitting in the side torsos ease of getting engine hits due to doubled number of engine crits and increased heat for movement all of these limiting factors are not available for tanks based on the available rules there are no damage locations where tank engines are there are no internal crit slots for tanks tanks do nt have to worry about movement heat as you can see tanks were made overly simple so that they were easy to play and integrate due to these simplifications you ca nt easily integrate 2x engine rules for them on further investigation you ll see that the same problems exist for aerospace fighters conventional fighters and the other vehicles if you are going to put rules for 2x engines in for other vehicles you will have to rebuild lot of the game the clans would probably never have 2x engine mechs their mechs tend to point to huge standardization policy throughout the clans and would be very slow to change to 2x engines upon discovering 2x engine mechs even with those points of logic out of the way it should be apparent enough that the clans are nasty enough as they are and need no further modification you will find that 2x engine mechs come only half way to meeting the clans on even grounds would nt want 100 ton clan mech with 2x engines stomping on my face and ripping my lipps off special technology st engines st engines were developed primarily to incorporate the weight saving capabilities of xl engines without the huge space requirements st engines are best described as being halway between standard and xl engines st engines are best used on one engine mechs that need extra tonnage for ballistic weapons and extra space for the weapons themselves for 2x engine mechs internal space becomes critically short when both engines are made xl making the use of st engines predominant st engines weigh 75 the weight of standard engine this in comparison to xl engines that weigh the weight of standard engine st engines require extra crit slots on critical hit table these crit slots have already been described for 2x engine mechs for one engine mechs st engines require one extra slot in each of the torsos engine hits are required to destroy an st engine regardless if they are in the side or center torsos for figuring the costs of an st engine as per 128 of the battletech compendium use the formula of 10000 rating tonnage 75 notes on st engines as you can see st engines are halfway xl engines that what they are intended to be when first came up with st engines had trouble convincing my friends the need of st engines they are truly put in for 2x engine mechs have never seen their use on one engine mechs use them as you please the clans would probably never use st engines they would more then likely use xl engines exclusively historically you could say that st engines are stepping stone to xl engines with their use relegated primarily to 2x engine mechs you could also say that peripheral houses and governments developed them as their best effort to reach xl technology 2x cockpit and 2x engine 2x cockpit mechs 2x cockpit mechs are natural outgrowth of mech designs that had seats in mech cockpit where one seat was for the mech pilot and the other seat was for commanderobservernobody useful there are types of 2x cockpit mechs one engine 2x cockpit 2x engine 2x cockpit alpha and 2x engine 2x cockpit beta after the descriptions of the three type of 2x cockpit mechs rules will be given for their use note when examples of the internal structure are shown there will be two empty critical slots with astricks these are the slots for extra sensors to be placed in they will be explained later in the rules 2x cockpit mechs these designs are achieved through the removal of the cockpit from the head and replacing it with cockpit in each side torso the critical hit table is modified by replacing the head with six empty crit slots this effectively turns the head from cockpit center into weapons platform this platform can have turret like ground vehicle where the turret mechanism weighs ten percent of the weapons mounted round up to the nearest half ton when the armor has been breached and internals have been scored roll for turret lock where the turret locks on roll of 13 if the turret locks it locks facing the hexside that it was firing into that turn the side torsos are modified as such left side torso right side torso life support life support sensors sensors cockpit cockpit life support life support the pilot can be in one side or the other as long as which side has the pilot and which side has the gunner is marked on the sheet before the game begins 2x engine 2x cockpit mechs alpha these types of mechs are achieved through the addition of cockpit to the center torso traditionally the gunner would be positioned in the torso and the pilot would be in the head this arrangement can be swapped around with little problem but it would seem more logical to have the pilot in the head the head can not be mounted on turret the head and center torso critical hit tables would look like this center torso head life support cockpit gyro gyro gyro life support life support sensors cockpit gyro sensors life support to put the gunner in the head move the sensors from the center torso and put them in the and slots in the head 2x engine 2x cockpit mechs beta these types of mechs are achieved through putting both of the cockpits in the center torso the advantage of this arrangement is that the head can act as weapons platform like the rules above state the primary disadvantage is that whenever the center torso is hit on both pilots take damage and roll for consciousness the head can act as turreted weapons platform as discussed above in the rules for 2x cockpit mechs the center torso is modified as such center torso life support gyro cockpit gyro gyro life support life support sensors cockpit gyro sensors life support the pilot is in the upper cockpit while the gunner is in the lower cockpit notice also that there are no provisions for there to be backup sensors on this type of mech general rules covering 2x cockpit mechs there are cockpits on 2x cockpit mechs one is for pilot where the other one is for gunner these two pilots work together to pilot and fight the mech the cumulative effect of these two working together and being able to concentrate on their jobs is that the piloting and gunnery skills are better to reflect these advantages mech with two cockpits has bonus on its to hit and piloting target numbers the pilot controls the piloting functions of the mech but he can also do weapons firing if the gunner should be killed the pilot can take over weapons fire the turn after the gunner is killed the mech can not fire weapons but can still move this represents the pilot realizing the loss of the gunner and switching over gunnery systems to his control after this turn of lost weapons fire the pilot operates the mech without the piloting skill bonus and has penalty to weapons fire the gunner controls the firing functions of the mech but he can also pilot the mech if the pilot should be killed the gunner can take over moving the mech the turn after the pilot is killed the mech can not move but may continue to fire weapons this represents the gunner realizing the loss of the pilot and switching over movement systems to his control after this turn of lost movement the gunner operates the mech without the gunnery bonus and has penalty to piloting skill the bonuses and penalties mentioned above are treated just like any of the bonuses and penalties found in the rules and can be made cumulative with any other modifiers if the players are using the optional rules for dni and vrpp piloting enhancements they can also be used with 2x cockpit mechs the two pilots had better know each other very well to be allowed to use dni if both the pilot and the gunner are killed then the mech is considered destroyed the sensors that were deleted from one of the cockpits can be left in to serve as backup sensors either one or both of the deleted sensors can be left in as long as there are two undestroyed sensors critical hit locations remaining on the mech there is no effect from sensors hits when is rolled onto torso hit location that has cockpit in it will also damage the pilotgunner like head hit when 2x cockpit mech falls the pilot must roll two piloting skill rolls to determine if both he and the gunner take damage roll each one seperately when ammunition explodes each pilot takes one point of damage as oppossed to both taking two points if one of the pilots is dead then the other takes points of damage 10 life support hits are kept for each cockpit and are seperate from each other it is possible for one pilot to take hits from excess heat and the other to be perfectly fine 11 conciousness rolls for each pilot are done seperately and are independant of each other it is possible for one pilot to be unconcious while the other is not if this should happen treat the unconcious pilot to be temporarely dead refer to rules for switchover procedure when the unconcious pilot regains conciousness he may resume his functions at the beginning of the next turn design notes on 2x cockpit mechs 2x cockpit mechs are just about the epitome of battlemech technology when you combine 2x engine 2x cockpit rules with stxl engine rules throw in any other sundry advanced technologies you wish and you will have true war machines these rules were developed well before the clans came out based on the reading ve done do nt think the clans would go for this type of mechs their honor code would seem to dictate that they fight without someone else help anyway would you want the clans to be any more powerful normally the cockpit of mech has second seat for passenger but that seat has no special function these rules are designed to add special seatings for specialty observers note that the people in these seats can not control the mech that they are in in any special manner or way exception mech gunners they are only observers if the critical hit location that the second chair takes up is destroyed then the passenger is killed and can not perform their function if the pilot critical hit location is destroyed then the mech is considered destroyed for one cockpit mechs 2x cockpit mechs are different in that the cockpit up in the head normally the pilot cockpit is the only cockpit that can have second chair destruction of the head still results in the observers death as well as the pilotgunner but the 2x cockpit mech still functions as per the 2x cockpit rules exception mech gunners the mech is not considered destroyed if the head is still intact and the pilot is unconciousdead then the gunner can still fire the mech weapons mech gunners can not be used in 2x cockpit mechs artillery spotter the artillery spotter is trained professional in the coordination of offboard artillery fire their seat has range finding and communication equipment built in to assist them advantages the as mech can act as an oberver for off board artillery fire any off board artillery fire using this mech as the observer gets to hit bonus for observing unit gunnery skill as per p49 of the battletech compendium weight the artillery spotter seat weighs 15 tons and takes up critical location in the head company commander the company commander can be in command mech that has trusted pilot piloting his mech while he pays attention to the battle his attention to the battle plus his training gives his company special advantage over those that do not have dedicated command mech advantages the command mech and the 11 other mechs designated as being in the comapany get special and seperate initiative roll they roll 2d6 for their initiative instead of the regular 1d6 disadvantagesrequirements for the company commander to be able to do hisher job the command mech must be equipped with c3 masters and the rest of the company must be set up with the c3 system as per the rules in the battletech compendium p118 this communication and coordination still continues even if los between company mates is blocked or there is guardian operating in the los even if the c3 does not work weight the commander seat weighs ton and takes up critical spot in the head forward observer the forward observer is person trained in the coordination and directin of all indirect fire she can assist in the firing of normal artillery fire and indirect missile fire advantages the fo mech can act as an observer for unit firing lrm or brm missiles indirectly for this fire there is no automatic penalty to the to hit and the fo mech can make attacks as normal the fo mech can also act as spotter for off board artillery fire giving to hit bonus for observing unit gunnery skill as per p49 of the battletech compendium weight the forward observer seat weighs tons and critical spot in the head mech gunner the mech gunner is mechwarrior in specially designed chair that allows the gunner to fire the mech weapons while the normal pilot concentrates on piloting the mech while this system has the same advantages as cockpits it still has the inherent disadvantage that destroying the head will knock out the mech advantages the mech with mech gunner can fire weapons and pilot better any piloting skill rolls and weapons fire is done at bonus cumulative with other bonuses and penalties disadvantages the mech gunner in this system can not be combined with the cockpit system it is eitheror if the gunner gets knocked out via unconciousness or critical hit then the mech can not fire weapons if the pilot is knocked out in similar manner then the mech can not move if the head is destroyed then the mech is counted as destroyed otherwise refer to rules and the first part of 11 in the cockpit rules for assitional information mech gunner chairs can not be installed on 2x cockpit mechs weight the mech gunner seat weighs tons and takes up critical hit location in the head gyros can be rounded to the nearest half or quarter ton depending on what your are rounding nearest to in your design and there are several different types of internal structures armors and defensive systems that can be used by mech each are detailed below endo steel this is the same as presented in the books with the exception of changing the number of critical hit locations that are taken up this is done to make its use more viable tons half standard slots 10 nitivir composite this extra strong internal structure is made from laticed composite of nickel titanium vanadium iridium and other standard metals this combonation is heavier and bulkier than standard internal structure but is 25 more resilient to damage and allows the mech to mount heavier armor the mech with nitivir composite multiplies the amount of internal points for each of the internal structure areas by 125 round up this new higher number is the amount of internal structure each area has and is used as the base for the max number of armor points that the area can mount if the number of internal structure or armor points in location exceeds the number of circles that the mech sheet has simply write the excess points next to the appropriate location tons standard slots 10 standard internal structure the standard internal structure is not changed at all from the rules it is though used as the basis of comparison for the other internal structures the below armor types are base armors and are not compatible with each other see the defensive systems below to see which are compatible with what ferrofibrous armor this armor is like that presented in the rules with changes to make its use more viable the armor value is multiplied by 12 instead of 112 where did they get 112 tons standard slots 10 ceramosteel armor this armor uses the natural heat resistive properties of ceramic materials and meshes them within layers of standard armor ceramosteel armor comes in ratings level and level level ceramosteel comes with armor rating multiplier of 11 similar to ferrofibrous and makes the mech invulnerable to energy weapons target heat from lasers ppcs etc incindiery target heat from infernos flamers and the like still affect the mech normally level ceramosteel armor gets no armor multiplier but makes the mech invulnerable to any target heat tons standard for both levels slots 10 for both levels reflective armor this is an armor where the armor plates have been covered in layers of polished metallic flakes the effect is to reduce the effectiveness of lasers hitting the target the disadvantage is that the overall armor resiliancy is reduced reflective armor reduces the effectiveness of incoming laser fire all laser fire that hits the mounting vehicle has point of damage subtracted from it example large laser and medium lasers are fired at tank with reflective armor the net damage is 15 81 51 51 reflective armor gives less protection than standard armor and is expressed by multiplying the number of armor points available by standard armor this ablative armor is not changed from the game yet is used as the basis of comparison for other armors below are defensive systems that can be designed into mech in addition to other armorsdefensive systems refer to the description of each one to determine what can armorssystems can be used on the same mechvehicle blue shield project this system is concentrated particle field dampener which dissipates incoming ppc fire blue shield way tons and takes up one critical hit space in each of the mechvehicle hit locations this system halves the damage of any lppc ppc hppc or variants critical hit to blue shield slot destroys the entire shield every time that blue shield is activated by ppc or hppc hit roll 2d6 on roll of when hit by ppc or on roll of or when hit by hppc the system overloads destroying all of the shield critical locations and inflicting points of internal damage to all of the hit locations except for the head which takes one point of internal damage blue shield is compatible with all of the armors and can be use with the other defensive systems chameleon system this is system that evaluates the surrounding terrain with electronic sensors and changes the color scheme of the armor on the mechvehicle it works best when the mounting vehicle is not moving and in some type of obscuring terrain the chameleon system weighs tons and takes up one critical hit space in each hit location this system adds to hit penalty to any weapons fire against the mounting vehicle when the mounting vehicle is standing still walkscruises or jumps it has no effect when the mounting vehicle runsflanks when the mounting vehicle is stationary for the turn in hex that provides terrain modifiers to hit woods smoke etc the terrain to hit penalties against the mounting vehicle are used as the effects of the chameleon system example fred walks his mech that has the chameleon system and ends it in heavy woods hex since he walked it any fire against his mech has to hit penalty in addition to any other modifiers the next turn fred does not move his mech remaining in the heavy woods hex the chameleon system gives any fire against the mech to hit penalty for heavy woods hex that the chameleon system emulates in addition to the for the heavy woods his mech is in and any other modifiers the chameleon system is not very good at keeping the color coordination if the mounting vehicle is runningflanking or jumping this difficulty can overload the system with disasterous results at the end of any turn that the mounting vehicle runsflanks or jumps it must roll 2d6 on roll of or the system has overloaded and explodes this destroys all of the system critical locations and inflicts points of internal damage to all of the hit locations except for the head which takes one point of internal damage the chameleon system can be used with all armors except reflective armor and defensive systems except for reactive armor reactive armor this is bolted on armor that protects the mech from slow incoming projectiles by using shaped charge to blow them away it can be combined with any of the other types of armor the covering of reactive armor requires internal support brackets which take up space reactive armor requires critical hit space in each of the mechs vehicle locations and weighs equal to the mechsvehicle tonnage20 any missile and certain other weapon attacks made against the target with reactive armor do half damage round fractions up the armor location hit must have armor points left for this to work or there will be no effect any critical hits to the reactive armor slots count as no effect vtols may not have reactive armor reactive armor has no effect upon tsm or inferno every time that the mech is hit by missile fire and reactive armor is used roll 2d6 on roll of the armor has blown back the missile at bad angle apply the half damage to the location hit and then roll for another hit location this second hit location takes an equal amount of damage as the first reactive armor is compatible with all armor and defensive systems except for chameleon system reactive armor will not explode when set afire type damage heat

platoon 22 baip star 23 self destruct your mech 24 the critical means that of these weapons can be fitted into one location if this location gets hit both weapons are lost the two weapons can be considered banked as per the rules below any weapn that takes up x5 critical hit locations can fit another critical hit location item with one of its lines example an lbx15 takes up 85 critical hit locations on one of the lines small laser can share the same line as one of the lbx15 lines another example would be where crm3 has 15 tons of ammo assigned to it the first line would be crm3 the second would read crm3 12 ton ammo and the last line would read ton crm3 ammo the target heat means that for every medium lasers that hit the target receives point of heat refer to the target heat rules found below the large laser and variants had their weights reduced to make them more competitive with other weapons it seemed that the large laser was not worth the weight of the weapon therefore the weight is reduced on this weapons list these two weapons seemed like natural outgrowthes of the standard ppc the pulse ppc also seemed like they should belong somehow their only special rule is that there is to hit for them as opposed to the for the pulse lasers the electrical discharge cannon is an energy weapon designed around the principle of discharging huge amounts of electrical energy into the target for the edc to fire discharge coil is needed as this coil burns out everytime the weapon fires the weapon is designed to have new coil placed in the receptacle and the burned out one cycled out in way similar to an autocannon reload system thus in the listing for the weapon under ammunition the number gives how many coils the ammunition for the edc is not truly ammo when it is hit it does not explode the edc will cause collateral damage to units in water hexes if the edc hits target in or above like hovercraft or lam at elevation water the edc does full damage to all targets in that hex any units in or above water hex away will receive full damage minus points any units in or above water hexes away will receive full damage minus 10 points of damage any unit or more hexes away is safe from collateral damage the weights of the lighter autocannons were lowered because they were perceived to be to heavy for them to be worth taking the benefits of low heat and high range were not enough to counter the drawbacks of very high weight and possibility of ammo explosions it got to the point that all ac through ac 10 were replaced with different weapons due to their attractiveness therefore the weights of some of the ac were reduced the weights of the lbx autocannons were made higher than the standard models to compensate for the fact that they were better than standard autocannons granted these changes to the various autocannons are not historical but then again who plays historically the flamer and the flame thrower are modified to make them more worth their weight in addition to doing their damage these weapons incur incindiery target heat upon their target the target heat from these weapons will remain on the target for turns any additional target heat beyond 10 points carries over for an additional turns refer to the target heat rules below the coolant cannon is weapon that does no damage and is designed to cool down mech in one of two methods the first is to take any flameinferno heat that is sticking to the target and eliminate it any flameinferno heat fired upon the target after it has been cooled will act normally this first method of cooling will take precedence over the second method this first method of attack is similar to blowing out candle or using fire extinguisher to put out fire the second method of attack for coolant cannon is to eliminate 10 points of heat generated that turn by the target this can be done only if the target has no flameinferno target heat generating at the time if the target has less than 10 points of flameinferno heat generateing at the time for example points the coolant cannon would eliminate the points of fameinferno heat and reduce the heat generated by the target by in general terms the coolant cannon does 10 points of target heat it will eliminate up to 10 points of flameinferno heat any remaining coolant cannon damage will reduce that turns heat output for the target by the remaining amount coolant cannons can only be mounted on ground vehicles since the volume of the coolant is too large to mount on battlemech if rules are made such that coolant cannon were to take up crits the number is listed in parentheses 10 bombardment range missiles brm brm are an extreme range weapon designed to saturate an area with warheads it is rather erratic weapon in its performance but this is compensated for by its long range brm do not roll on the missile hit chart to determine the number of missiles that hit instead number of d6 are rolled to determine the number that hit when firing at extreme range number of d61 are rolled and the number of d3 when firing at maximum range the damage that brm does is distributed as an lrm would would every points of damage is rolled for if artemis is tied in to brm an extra d6 is rolled to determine the number of missiles that hit if the number of missiles that would hit is greater than the rating of the launcher then simply all of the missiles hit brm may indirect fire just as lrm can 11 tactical support missiles tsm tsm are an area effect mech mounted reloadable weapon system based loosely on the lrm it utilizes an airburst schrapnel charge to spread its damage over an area tsm do points of damage to any units in the target hex and points of damage to any units one hex away from the target hex the surrounding hexes like artillery tsm attack hexes rather than units the to hit roll is modified only by intervening terrain and the attacking unit movement and condition never by the movement or condition of units in the hex to determine the number of missiles that hit roll on the missile hit chart under the appropriate number obviously the tsm1 is hit or miss deal roll for scatter for any tsm that did not hit their intended target hex use the artillery scatter method roll each missile seperately the firing of tsm can not be modified or helped by the following systems artemis aar gar narc tag or anything else that would improve the accuracy or damage of the missile this restriction does not apply to 2x cockpit mechs c3 or pilotgunners that have an improved gunnery skill this reflects the fact that the tsm is ballistic missile that air bursts over the target and can not really be guided to the explosion point another reason is because these things are nasty enough as they are when tsm ammunition explodes due to heat or critical hit each missile explodes for points of damage 12 mrm medium range missiles medium range missiles were developed as support weapons that would have longer range than srm but shorter range than lrm to resolve missile hit from an mrm conduct it in manner similar to an lrm except that mrm hit in groups of as opposed to in groups of as with lrm mrm can not be fired in indirect fire mode they are except as noted previouslly functionally similar to lrm 13 crm close range missiles are an functionally similar to srm except that they do points of damage per missile that hits 14 inferno weapons the only changes from the inferno rules as listed on p60 of the battletech compendium are listed below the max target heat that infernos of any kind can deliver is 10 instead of inferno1 is based upon the tsm1 use notes 11b 11d and 11e for additional information the inferno1 delivers target heat to anything in the target hex and target heat to anything in the immediately surrounding hexes while the geneva conventions and the rules may prohibit the use of incindiery weapons against infantry we warmongers will not the number of men killed by an inferno attack is equal to the target heat inflicted 15 tag laser the tag laser appeared to be too limited in scope for your average warmonger to make the tag laser more useful for its weight it was decided to make it helpful for normal missile attacks in addition to your average arrow iv attack in addition to its normal functions the tag laser can be used by mech about to make missile attack against target fire the tag laser first if it hits then any one missile launcher may be fired at that target with to hit modifier of since the tag laser has more definate lock on the target and feeds its information to the selected missile launcher multiple tag lasers are needed for multiple launcher assists and can only assist in missile shots at the taged target tag can be combined with any missile launcher or targeting enhancement tag is useless with thunder and swarm munitions there is no additional cost to launchers or munitions to use tag the c3 system capability to emulate tag does not get the to hit missile bonus 16 narc pods the narc as presented in the rules is well to put it bluntly pretty wimpy here are the modifications suggested any missile equipped attack against narced target has to hit and on the missile chart instead of just the to missile hit chart modifier as presented in the rules originally record the hit location of where the narc beacon will hit once that location has been destroyed mech arm destroyed or blown off then the narc beacon is lost also narc and artemis are still incompatible the idea of special narc missiles has been discarded all normal missiles and those not specifically mentioned are narc compatible 17 artemis the only change to the artemis is that artemis assisted brm attacks get an additional d6 d61 d3 to determine the number of missiles that hit 18 antimissile system ams ammunition antimissile laser aml and pulse antimissile laser paml was somebody smoking dope at fasa and not invite us why does the original rules state that ams get only 12 reloads especially if you can expend all 12 in one shot and treat an ams ammo hit as machine gun ammo hello is this thing on increase ams ammunition to 50 shots per ton even that is being mean the anti missile laser is an energy weapon based version of the ams it operates exactly like an ams except that there is no ammunition to go with the weapon after the aml has been used roll 2d6 if two is rolled then the focusing mechanism has been overstressed and has broken the aml can not be used until repaired the pulse antimissile laser is pulse energy weapon based version of the ams it operates exactly like an aml except that the paml can engage twice per turn and the heat generated is 1d6 per engaging after each time that the paml is engaged roll 2d6 if two is rolled the paml focusing device is damaged this will knock out the paml until repaired if the paml is damaged on it first use of the turn then it can not be used again that turn or for the rest of the game 19 icewind the icewind system is not an offensive weapon but defensive heat reducing system it is bottle of nonflammable gas in liquid state under compression when the ambiant temperature of the mech reaches preset level the easy melt cap of the bottle melts releasing cold cloud of vapor into the interior of the mech cooling the mech off for every icewind installed put line on the heat scale this represents the setting of the icewind if multiple icewinds are mounted settings can be put on the same line resolve the heat buildup for the mech normally if the final heat level for that turn is above the rating of the icewind then each icewind that it is above releases for each icewind that releases reduce the heat scale by points that is the final heat level for the mech for that turn once an icewind has gone off it is gone for the game in campaign an icewind can be reloaded same as doing quick reload yet requires coolant truck 20 anti aircraft radar aar aar is special targeting system that is used against any aerial target aerospace fighters conventional fighters vtol and lam in lam mode but not mechs that are simply jumping for any attacks that are made against aerial targets that utilize aar the movement to hit modifiers are halved example mech with aar that is running to hit is trying to fire on vtol flying 11 hexes to hit the total modifier to hit is since the mech is using aar the total movement based to hit modifier is 35 which is rounded up to aar does not compensate for any other to hit modifiers that might accumulate such as heat terrain or pilot aar may be used by the affected targets listed in parenthesis above against other such targets aar may not be used against targets on the ground aar does not have to be linked to all weapons on mechvehicle if aar is linked to only certain weapons then only those weapons get the benefits of the aar aar weighs ton for every tons of weapons that it is tied into it takes up one critical for every ton of weight once the aar has taken one critical it is destroyed the aar can not be mounted in the legs guardian ecm nullifies the capabilities of aar if the defender has guardian or the line of sight from the aar using unit to the defender passes within hexes of an enemy aar 21 ground attack radar gar ground attack radar is in game terms functionally similar to aar except that it can only be used by aerial targets to fire upon ground targets gar is the aar that can be used against targets on the ground as mentioned in rule 19c gar can not be used to help in the fire of strafing runs gar is used for firing upon individual targets while strafing saturates an area with fire gar can not be used by ground mechsvehicles for use against other ground targets the only way for lam to use gar is for them to be flying in either lam or fighter mode vtols or any other flying craft that has landed may not use gar for any attacks that are made against ground targets that utilize gar the movement to hit modifiers are halved example lam in airmech mode with gar that is jumping to hit is trying to fire on mech running hexes to hit the total modifier to hit is since the lam is using gar the total movement based to hit modifier is 25 which is rounded up to gar does not compensate for any other to hit modifiers that might accumulate such as heat terrain or pilot gar does not have to be linked to all weapons on mechvehicle if gar is linked to only certain weapons then only those weapons get the benefits of the aar gar weighs ton for every tons of weapons that it is tied into it takes up one critical for every ton of weight once the aar has taken one critical it is destroyed the aar can not be mounted in the legs guardian ecm nullifies the capabilities of aar if the defender has guardian or the line of sight from the aar using unit to the defender passes within hexes of an enemy aar 22 infantry pods are special cargo carriers that come with one platoon of jump infantry that are mounted on mechs the criticals that the pods take represent special internal bracing for seating and life support equipment the infantry take no damage from weapons hits to the mech because they are in an armored pod as opposed to hanging on the sides of the mech the pod andor exit doors are normally mountedfacing the back or the top of the mech while these pods tend to grossly distort the normal profile of the mech they do not make it any easier to target the jump infantry may dismount from the mech as per regular infantry except that the mech does not need to expend 1mp remounting is per regular rules remember that infantry may not move or fire the turn that they dismount the reaon that 1mp does not have to be expended is because the infantry can jump down and land safely while the mech is moving the pods must be mounted in the torsos head or arms if mounted in the arms the mech may not make make any physical attacks involving the arms while infantry are in their pod if the head or arm is blown off with critical hits and the infantry are still in their pod they suffer 2d6 casualties when the infantry pod has suffered critical hit any infantry still in the pods suffer 1d6 casualties and casualty when the heat scale is 1525 and when it is 25 double this number if the infantry pod has suffered critical hits on the second critical hit 2d6 remaining infantry are destroyed any infantry in the pod when it suffers its third critical hit are destroyed the platoon of jump infantry comes free with the pod and does not have to be payed for in any manner 23 battlearmor infantry pods baip are just like infantry pods except that they carry one star man team of battlearmor the rules below will either refer you to the rules above or modify it these rules are different and should not be confused with the mechanized battlearmor rules on p4445 of the battletech compendium refer to note 22a same as note 22b except that when the location is blown off each trooper suffers 1d6 damage when this type of infantry pod suffers critical hit each trooper takes 1d6 points of damage on the second critical hit all remaining troopers are destroyed battlearmor suffer no damage for excessive heat when baip is mounted on the mech it does not come with the battle armor troops free each point of battle armor counts as ton mech and most be bought as such they may be mounted in the baip at the start of the game 24 self destruct is system for voluntarily making your mech into small ultrahot ball of thermal destruction it takes the reactor fuel and dumps it into the reactor after which the magnetic bottle is allowed to decay rapidly the end result is metallic vapor where the mech used to be and blast marks for meters the self destruct device weighs one ton and takes up one critical hit location which must be located in one of the torsos when activated the device destroys the mech and anything in the same hex anything hex away takes damage equal to the engine rating divided by 15 if the mech is 2x engine mech then the engine rating used is the sum of the engine ratings if one of the engines has been destroyed due to damage then the total engine rating is based upon the one operating engine the device is activated during the weapons attack phase as if it were weapon no weapons may be fired if the device is to be activated units taking damage take target heat equal to 12 the damage taken round down this target heat lasts for that turn only similar to energy weapon target heat units that self destruct are destroyed and count towards the victory of the enemy it is assumed that the pilot give themselves enough time to eject before the explosion those of us that created these rules really do nt care but some of you might after all life is cheap mechs are nt target heat rules these rules were created to simulate the fact that when certain weapons hit they are going to create additional heat upon their target certain weapons are designed for this task while others create target heat do to the huge energy conversion of their damage the types of weapons that create target heat can be divided up into two general groups energy weapons and incindiery weapons these two weapons groups are treated seperately within these rules the target heat that weapon inflicts upon target is listed in the tarheat column of the weapons damage chart incindiery weapons are marked with an target heat from energy weapons when an energy weapon hits target it will recieve target heat the heat that the target recieves affects it only for the turn that the weapon hit the target heat that target recieves is treated as heat generated by the mech that turn there is no limit to the amount of energy weapon target heat that unit can receive example during turn mech has walked heat fired ppc 20 heat and was hit by ppc and medium lasers heat its heat sinks must dissipate 24 heat that turn the next turn the same mech runs heat fires ppc 20 heat and is hit by among other weapons large laser and medium lasers 25 heat rounded down to this turn the mech must dissipate 24 heat notice that none of the energy weapon target heat from turn did not carry over to the next turn target heat from incindiery weapons incindiery weapons are generally inferno launchers and flamersflamethrowers they are marked on the weapons damage chart in the tarheat column with an incindiery weapon target heat is described on p60 of the battletech compendium under the heading of infernos the only additions to those rules is the max heat that target can receive is 10 instead of inferno launchers have to roll to determine the number of missiles that explode close enough to the target to generate target heat and flamers flamethrowers are considered in the same class as inferno launchers weapon banking rules weapons can be mounted in pairs on the same weapon mount this is known as banking banked weapons must be mounted in the same area of the mechvehicle for mechs both weapons must be completely in the hit location area example pair of ac 20 could not be banked on mech since of them would not fit in any one hit location be it torso or an arm pair of heavy ppc could be banked in an arm since it has critical locations and hppc would take up critical slots the above pair of ac 20 could be banked in the turret of tank but not on mech remember that lower arm and hand actutors can be removed for more criticals the weapons banked must be of the exact same type exception missile launchers of the same type but of different size can be banked any weapon except for artillery weapons can be banked banked weapons can fire together as one weapon for this only one to hit roll is made if the bank hits then both weapons hit in the same location if the to hit roll is missed then both weapons miss banked weapons do not have to be fired as bank they may be fired independently nonenergy weapons that are fired banked must both use the same type of ammunition different types of alternate ammunitions can not be used two critical space weapons in the same critical slot are automatically counted as being banked for other weapons to be counted as banked there must be some discernable mark connecting the two weapons if one banked weapon is destroyed there is no effect upon the other weapon it may only fired independently though and not banked with another weapon alternate ammunitions for weapons this section is listing of the various types of different munitions that can be used for weapons the basic format will be weapon this will tell what weapon the ammo may be used for description this will give description plus necessary special rules advantages self explanatory disadvantages self explanatory note all of the alternate ammunitions must be used as reloads in full or half ton increments part of ton of one type of ammunition can not be mixed with complementary part of ton of another type be prepared that some 20th century acronyms are used using different words this reflects that the names will change to reflect changing technology other types use name from history to represent what they are loosely based upon all ammunition types must be specified before the start of the game any unspecified reloads are assumed to be standard cannister shot ammunition weapon rail gun rail cannon gauss rifle and gauss cannon description cannister shot is where the standard round slug is replaced with container of submunitions the net effect is that the damage is spread all over the target hit cannister is less volatile and less effective version of silver bullet ammunition advantages when target has been it with cannister shot roll on the standard missile hit chart under the column for the damage that the weapon does this is the amount of damage that the weapon does roll for hit location for each point of damage as per the lbx autocannon cluster munitions disadvantages due to the size and shape of the cannister shot round gauss cannons only get 10 shots per ton of reloads the gauss rifle and the gauss cannon shots per ton chain shot ammunition weapon rail gun rail cannon gauss rifle and gauss cannon description chain shot takes round of shot and replaces it with hollow hemispheres connected by heavy chain the tendency for the chain to wrap around part of mech creates problems for the pilot of the target mech the reduced volume of the shot reduces the damage done take the base damage for the weapon firing and divide it by this is the damage that each of the halves will do when the weapon hits each of the halves will hit potentially different hit location to represent the wrapping possibility of the chain the hit location procedure is modified for each half roll d6 to represent the direction that the half will hit from roll of means damage is rolled on the front goes to the right side front roll on the right side hit location table torso damage goes on the front to the right side rear to the rear to the left side rear and rolls on the left side front once the direction has been determined roll 2d6 for location as per normal rules advantages when hit the target must make piloting skill roll with penalty if both halves hit the legs if this is failed then the target mech falls any piloting skill rolls after being hit by chain shot are at penalty until the mech expends mp to free itself of the chain each chain shot that accumulates gives an additional penalty to the piloting skill roll example mech has been hit by chain shots in one turn trying to get back up will require piloting skill roll with penalty due to the chain shots hanging fom it after getting back up the mech expends mp to free itself of chain shots from here the mech makes piloting skill rolls with penalty due to the remaining chain shot hanging from it disadvantages since the chain shot is very unpredictable in its ballistic characteristics there is to hit penalty vehicles do not have to make piloting skill roll when first hit but still have the piloting skill roll penalties just as mechs nested slug ammunition weapon rail cannon gauss rifle and gauss cannon description nested slug ammunition uses nested set of rail gun rounds instead of one large round it distributes the damage over several areas the round still does full damage it just divides it over or areas advantages ns ammo divides the damage into groups of points roll for damage location for the or groups of damage points seperately disadvantages due to the size and shape of the ns round gauss cannons only get 10 shots per ton of reloads the gauss rifle and the gauss cannon shots per ton silver bullet ammunition weapon rail gun rail cannon gauss rifle gauss cannon description silver bullet ammo is single round with an explosive charge in the center this charge is used to explode the round near its target if hit is made using sb ammo roll to determine the amount of damage on the 10 15 or 20 column of the missile hit chart distribute each point of damage individually like an lbx autocannon round advantages when firing sb ammo there is to hit modifier disadvantages in addition to the weapon doing damage when hit as per normal rules the ammo will explode when hit by critical hit or exploding due to heat when exploding there will be 10 15 or 20 points of damage per round exploded explosion strength per round based upon original damage value of weapon smart rock ammunition weapon rail gun rail cannon gauss rifle gauss cannon description smart rocks replace some of the shot mass with small guidance system and compressed gas steering rockets advantages there is to hit bonus when firing at medium range to hit when firing at long range to hit at extreme range and to hit at maximum range with smart rocks disadvantages when firing smart rocks there is additional to hit modifier when firing inside minimum range weapon damage is reduced also rail guns score points of damage rail cannons score gauss rifles score points and gauss cannons score 10 points when firing smart rocks armor peircing discarding sabot apds ammunition weapon auto cannons lbx autocannons ultra auto cannons description apds ammo replaces the normal round with smaller high velocity high density penetrator round inside sabot advantages apds ammo does some internal damage when the round hits refer to the chart below ac or lbx armor damage internal damage 10 15 10 20 13 disadvantages the apds round is high compression round that autocannons have trouble handling whenever apds rounds are fired roll second 2d6 for stress check if or is rolled the autocannon has broken some linkage on it that autocannon may still fire but has to hit penalty if the autocannon continues to fire apds roll stress check with or as failure if the autocannon fails this second check it is considered destroyed autocannon ultras that fire apds rounds roll stress checks twice lbx autocannons get bonus on the stress check roll when apds ammo takes critical hit or explodes the internal damage produced is twice that for normal exploding ammo bolt thrower bt ammunition weapon auto cannons lbx cannons ultra auto cannons description bolt thrower ammunition is standard auto cannon round that has roughly half the round mass removed to accomadate solid fuel propellent this propellent increases the range of the round significantly advantages when using bolt thrower ammo the classes of autocannons have these ranges class short medium long extreme maximum damage 112 1324 2536 3748 4960 19 1018 1927 2836 3745 10 18 916 1724 2532 3340 15 16 712 1318 1924 2530 20 15 610 1115 1620 2125 10 note minimum ranges are not affected disadvantages as can be seen from the table above the damage produced is 50 of the normal autocannon round due to the reduction in mass cluster ammunition weapon lbx autocannons description cluster ammunition is the standard cluster round that the lbx autocannons use as presented on p120 in the battletech compendium advantages as per the rules disadvantages only lbx autocannons can use these rounds flechette ammunition weapon lbx autocannons description flechette ammunition is similar to cluster ammunition except that it is specially designed for taking out infantry battlearmor and clearing trees advantages flechette ammunition does double normal damage versus infantry and battlearmor flechette retains the to hit bonus of lbx cluster rounds when firing lb10x or bigger with flechette rounds to clear heavy woods instead of reducing the heavy woods to light woods as per the rules these rounds will reduce them to rough hex disadvantages when firing this ammunition versus mechs or vehicles apply penalty to the roll on the missile hit chart to determine the amount of damage any rolls below are treated as heap ammunition weapon auto cannons lbx cannons ultra auto cannons description high explosive armor piercing rounds use shaped charge chemical warhead that burns through the armor to produce armor and internal structure damage advantages heap rounds do some internal damage and target heat in addition to the armor damage refer to the chart below ac or lbx armor dam internal dam target heat 10 15 20 12 disadvantages heap rounds use directional charge to do their damage if the round hit at the wrong angle then the blast is ineffective to represent this these rounds have to hit penalty against level ceramosteel armor heap rounds do no target heat on the target and against level ceramosteel armor heap rounds do only armor damage no internal or target heat damage due to the slow speed of these rounds reactive armor can affect them apply the 12 damage rule from reactive armor to these rounds also when fired against target with reactive armor bangalor missiles weapon mrm tsm lrm brm description bangalor missiles have for warhead several line charges acting as bangalor torpedoes an army engineer obstacle clearing charge these line charges also have landing spikes that allow them to land without bouncing or to stick to the side of buildings advantages bangalor missiles can do either of two things minefield clearing bangalor missiles can be used to attack mined hexes of any type bangalor missiles will reduce the attack strength of mined hex by the number of missilesattack strength per hex in the attack example hex that has been mined by 20 point fascam is attacked by point bangalor attack assuming that the attack hits the mined hex will have its attack strength reduced by down to 15 preset conventional minefields as per p6061 of the battletech compendium have an attack strength of and command detonated hexes have strength of 10 assuming the hex is attacked blindly in hopes that it is mined vibrabomb hexes that are attacked have their sensitivity rating lowered by the bangalor missile attack strength when the rating reaches the vibrabomb detonates as if tripped buildingfortification destruction bangalor missiles do double damage against buildings or any structure that has its strength listed in cf disadvantages bangalor missiles do no damage against mechs vehicles or infantry tag artemis and narc work only when firing bangalors against buildings fascam missiles fascam artillery rounds weapon mrm tsm lrm brm all artillery weapons description fascam missiles and fascam artillery rounds deliver field artillery scatterable family of mines each warhead contains an even mix of antivehicle and antipersonnel mines advantages fascam missiles are treated just like thunder lrm as described on p121 of the battletech compendium fascam artillery rounds deliver minefields over an area of hexes the target hex and the surrounding fascam artillery rounds deliver minefields in strengths equal to the damage that they would do normally example long tom is firing fascam shell when the shell lands the hex hit will have 20 point minefield and each of the surrounding hexes will have 10 point minefield fascam tsm are handled in manner similar to fascam artillery rounds except that the attack values are 52 per missile that lands in the target hex disadvantages the number of reloads per ton is half that for normal missilesartillery rounds fascam missiles are not affected by tag artemis or narc fuelair explosive fae missiles weapon tsm description fae missiles replace the standard explosive charges of tsm missiles with thermite ignited canister of hydrocarbon fuel the resulting explosion produces armor damage and target heat advantages each fae missile does points of damage points of incindiery target heat to the target hex and point of damage point of incindiery target heat to the surrounding hexes the incindiery target heat lasts for turns as per the inferno rules disadvantages fae missiles use the inferno rules concerning checking for ammo explosion due to heat if fae missile ammunition does explode due to heat or critical hit each missile explodes for 10 points of damage smoke missiles weapon tsm description smoke missiles are designed to fill the target hex and adjacent hexes with smoke advantages each missile will produce elevation high smoke cloud in the target hex and the adjacent hexes that lasts for turn for each missile that hits that hex disadvantages these missiles do no damage to any unit in the target hexes swarm missiles weapon mrm lrm brm description swarm missiles are special missiles using hundreds of submunitions able to saturate an area advantages swarm missiles are used just as the description on p121 of the battletech compendium for swarm lrms for the brm to determine the number of missiles that hit secondary target use d6 for every missiles remaining disregarding remaining portions of disadvantages the number of reloads per ton is half that for normal missiles tow missiles weapons mrm lrm brm description tow missiles are optically tracked wire guided missiles they operate in manner similar to ftl missiles in that only some of the missiles in rack are wire guided while the rest follow advantages to hit if firing unit is stationary to hit if firing unit walkedcruised to hit if firing unit ranflanked addit to hit if target is the only target to be attacked disadvantages double all terrain to hit modifiers to reflect the possibility of guide wire snap above advantages are lost if firing unit plans to enagage in close combat if the firing unit takes the advantages then it may not make close combat attacks tow missiles may not be fired indirectly tow missiles are not affected by narc artemis or guardian follow the leader ftl missiles weapons crm srm mrm lrm brm description modification to the guidance system of the missiles has the majority of the missiles in rack follow one missile advantages ftl missiles do not scatter their damage all over the target but concentrate in one location example if an lrm 20 rack fires with ftl missiles and hits with 12 missiles the missiles will all hit on one damage location area as opposed to in one area in another and in third disadvantages for ftl missiles to work the lead missile must be one that hits occasionally the targetting systems will follow the wrong missile firing with ftl missiles has fire modifier penalty radar guided missiles rg weapons crm srm mrm lrm brm description the crude guidance system of the missile has been replaced by rough radar unit these guidance systems are not very good yet not overly affected by guardian ecm advantages to hit light mechs to hit medium mechs to hit heavy mechs to hit assault mechs addit to hit if target has been hit by narc disadvantages rg missiles when fired have any terrain to hit modifiers doubled if the target is within hexes of an enemy ecm unit then the above modifiers are ignored and there is to hit if fired indirect and miss their original target then roll another to hit for any one randomly determined target within the hexes immediately surrounding the target if the to hit is made then the missiles hit that unit instead keep doing this procedure until an alternate target is hit or all possible alternate targets within the hexes have been missed if any clarifications are needed the rules are similar to those involving swarm missiles except that only one target is hit rg missiles are not affected by artemis or tag lasers multiply the number of reloads by 75 for radar guided missiles rg missiles are not affected by artemis radiation seeking missiles weapons crm srm mrm lrm brm description these missiles rely upon the emitions of special electronics to home in on their target they are not very good if the target does not have special electronic gear operating advantages the missiles have to hit bonus against any units that have active guardian beagle aar or gar for targets that have narc attached to them double the narc bonuses disadvantages the missiles have to hit penalty against any unit that does not have the above systems operating heat seeking hs missiles weapons crm srm description the hs warheads replace part of the explosive payload with an infrared guidance system advantages hs missiles receive to hit bonus equal to the target mech fire modifier from heat buildup if any from the beginning of the turn in addition if the target is receiving incindiery target heat from infernos or flamersflame throwers there is to hit bonus equal to the square of the target heat generated by the incidiery weapons rounded down example mech has ben hit by flame thrower and is receiving incindiery target heat the square root of is 223 which is rounded down to any hs missiles fired at that mech get to hit bonus of if the missiles score critical hits then they are automatically heat sinks before anything else disadvantages hs srm do point while hs crm do points of damage per missile that hits as well as blow up for that amount in ammo explosions if the heat scale of the target mech is then heat seeking missiles have to hit hs missiles are not affected by artemis or narc laser guided missiles lgm weapons crm srm mrm description lgm require the guidance of tag laser to work effectively when the tag laser hits the target then there is marked increase in the percentage of missiles that hit when the tag laser misses then the probability of hit decreases advantages lgm get on the missile hit chart if the target is taged by the firing mech the to hit for each missile launcher tied into tag laser as per the tag laser note above still applies lgm that are following tag beam do not get to hit penalties due to chameleon system disadvantages the announcement to fire lgm and tag laser must be made and adhered to before any dice are rolled if lgm and tag are fired and no tag laser hits then the lgm must be fired with to hit only tag laser fired from the firing mech can tag target for lgm to get their bonusses lgm can be fired without the intention to tag the target with to hit penalty tandem charge tc warhead missiles weapons crm srm description the tc warhead contains two shaped charge warheads where one punches hole in the armor allowing the second to damage the internal structure advantages crm with tc warheads do points of armor and one point of internal structure damage per missile srm with tc warheads do point of armor and point of internal damage if the area hit has no armor then each missile that hits does point of damage due to the narrowness of the impact area disadvantages the number of reload shots per ton is multiplied by 75 round down this represents the extra room required to hold the larger warheads for ammo explosions treat each tc crm as having point warhead and each tc srm as having point warhead tc warhead internal damage against its target roll to score critical hits on the critical hits effects table with modifier tc warheads score only critical on roll of 11 or 12 beehive artillery shells weapons long tom sniper thumper description these shells are effectively huge shotgun shells used to fire directly upon approaching enemy they are primarily used as last ditch weapon to beat back unwanted interlopers making use of this shell rare under normal circumstances gun train might have ton per gun of reloads on rare occasions when artillery guns are expected to be very close to the fighting 23 tons of reloads per gun are carried advantages these shells make the artillery guns act just like lbx autocannons take the base damage of the gun 20 for long toms 10 for snipers and for thumpers and roll 2d6 under that number on the missile hit chart twice these values are added together to determine the damage done each point of damage is allocated seperately example the shot from hell long tom fires beehive artillery round at an approaching mech and hits since the long tom does 20 points of base damage it rolls under the 20 column of the missile hit chart twice the long tom miraculously rolls an 11 and 12 doing 40 points of damage somebody had more than just bad hair day disadvantages the range of these rounds in hexes is equal to the number of boards that the gun can fire normal rounds the base to hit number is regardless of range copperhead artillery shells weapons long tom sniper thumper description these are missiles that are shot from the tube of the gun towards the general area of impact in flight on the descent the missiles rocket motor takes over and allows the missile to home in on taged target advantages follow the rules in the last three paragraphs of the last column under the rules for arrow iv missile artillery system on 117 of the battletech compendium these rules apply to copperhead artillery shells the long tom copperhead does 20 points of artillery damage to the target and points to any other unit in the hex the sniper copperhead does 10 points of artillery damage to the target and points to any other unit in the hex the thumper copperhead does points of artillery damage to the target and point to any other unit in the hex disadvantages these shells can not be used as standard artillery shells they must be used as tag homing missiles they can not carry any special kind of warhead dam buster artillery shells weapons arrow iv bolt iii dart ii long tom sniper thumper description these shells replace their normal high explosive warheads with concussionary charge these have the capability to clear minefields by setting off the mines and to damage buildings better these were first developed by long tom gunner to destroy dam that with its destruction was able to knock out company of enemy mechs advantages the target and adjacent hex damage of these shells are used to reduce the attack strength of mine hexes as per the rules for bangalor missiles these shells will also do double damage to any structure with cf rating example should three hex long building be hit in the center hex by long tom dam buster then it would receive 80 points of damage 20x2 for the center hex of the building 10x2 10x2 for each of the adjacent hexes of the building disadvantages these shells do 14 damage to infantry vehicles or mechs illumination artillery shells weapons dart ii thumper description these shells shoot round that has brightly burning peice of metal usually magnesium with parachute attached these shells are used to eliminate the effects of darkness during night fights advantages fire this shell as if it were normal shell when the hex of impact is determined this is actually the hex above which the illumination shell floats down on its parachute this hex will drift in the direction of the wind for each turn that it is up the illumination covers an area with radius of 10 hexes for turns smoke artillery shells weapons arrow iv bolt iii dart ii long tom sniper thumper description these smoke round rules replace those on 49 of the battletech compendium advantages arrow iv long tom these smoke rounds produce elevation high smoke cloud in the target hex and the adjacent hexes that lasts for turns bolt ii sniper these smoke rounds produce elevation high smoke cloud in the target hex and the adjacent hexes that lasts for turns dart ii and thumper these smoke rounds produce elevation high smoke cloud in the target hex and the adjacent hexes that lasts for turn telemetry artillery shells weapons arrow iv bolt iii dart ii long tom sniper thumper description these shells are used to better adjust fire with artillery guns using signal that orbitting geopositional satellites pick up the satellites then tell the firing crew within 10 meters where the shell landed the shell also releases small marker cloud that observers can use to better observe where the shell landed advantages these shells allow artillery peices to adjust fire against fixed positions without the need of an observer if these shells are fired with the help of an observer then there is bonus for adjusting fire with the next shot the bonuses do not add on to each other if telemetry shells are used or more times in row these bonuses are cumulative with observer and artillery gunner modifiers the hex that telemetry shell lands in counts as preregistered hex as per 48 of the battletech compendium once the shell has landed any shots against this hex automatically hit disadvantages these shells do no damage at all the bonus will only help the gunlauncher that fired the shell or any gunlauncher that is connected to the firing unit via c3 it is not possible for one gun to do the sounding shots for another gun unless they are connected by c3 as per the c3 rules white phospherous artillery shells weapons arrow iv bolt iii dart ii long tom sniper thumper description the willie pete white phosperous wp round is the field artillery version of inferno missiles this safer medium of delivering incindieries does not last as long as inferno liquid yet is the only kind that can stand the shock of firing without exploding advantages given below is table showing the target heat that wp shells deliver to the units in the hex of impact and the surrounding hexes target is heat listed as xy is treated where is the target heat that any units in the hex of impact receive and is the target heat that any units in surrounding hex take damage rating turn turn turn turn 2010 1010 105 52 20 105 105 52 20 52 52 20 note the damage rating is the damage that the weapon would do if it were to fire regular shell obviously bigger shell will do more heat longer disadvantages wp rounds do no damage only target heat wp rounds are treated just like infernos for purposes of interactions with coolant cannons if the coolant cannon were to use liquid oxygen instead of liquid nitrogen then double the heat inflicted up to 20 these rules are written to rectify the rules for infantry in battletech this is done under the following assumptions when determining the size of balanced game each side will determine its size in tons instead of some financial unit such as cbills if sides are determined in tons then the various types of infantry are inherently different in capability if the various types of infantry are different incapability then one or few types will be taken over all the others this eliminates some of the diversity that commanders can expect on the battlefield and some of the realistic options that commander can use in determining hisher force composition with these reasons the rules for infantry will be changed or expanded to make their use more defined and balanced equivelant tonnage free for standard infantry they weigh no tons when determining their cost the only requirement is that they be transported onto the battlefield in some vehicle or mech for transport by mech refer to the infantry pods in the weapons list and notes for transport by vehicle refer to the infantry carrier rules in the battletech compendium on page 44 battlearmor are handled differently from standard infantry in that tons must be paid for each point of battlearmor does not have to be carried on to the field via apc yet may be desirable movement modifiers this ill defined subject is addressed and changed here infantry recieve to hit bonus if they do not move and no penalties for moving since infantry do not have running speed there are no like modifiers jump infantry and battlearmor that jump as part of their movement get to hit penalty infantry type modifications since all movement types of infantry cost the same there must be some way to make all the infantry from rifle up to srm platoons equal below are the rules changes if any to the various types of infantry and battlearmor to make them equal rifle platoons the special advantage that rifle platoons get is that when they score damage and roll for location that location may be shifted up or down by one this shows that the soldiers are better able to control and call their shots example rifle platoon has hit mech from the front and has rolled for damage location giving right torso hit for the point group the rifle platoon has the option of shifting that damage location roll from to or hitting the right leg or the center torso the last points are rolled to hit 11 left arm the rifle platoon may shift it to 10 left arm again or to 12 head obviously it will be shifted to the head machine gun platoons machine gun platoons recieve to hit bonus due to hit due to the directed high rate of fire of their weapons flamer platoons flamer platoons get the bonus of doing heat damage in addition to their normal damage they inflict turns of incindiery heat as per the target heat rules equal to their damage value example flamer platoon with 16 men hits mech doing points of damage and points of target heat which lasts for turns laser platoons laser platoons inflict point of target heat for every infantrymen in the platoon round fractions down srm platoons srm platoons may not use any of the different srm warheads or guidance systems available for mech mounted srms machine gun battlearmor machine gun battlearmor recieve to hit bonus due to the directed high rate of fire flamer battlearmor flamer battlearmor use the flamer rules as presented in the weapons list small laser battlearmor no changes credit for ideas below is
