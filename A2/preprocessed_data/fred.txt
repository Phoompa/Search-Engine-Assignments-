once upon time all good stories start with once upon time there was man adrift upon sea of troubles he set sail upon the sea trying to escape from his clinging wife deadend job and bunch of pistolwaving accountants but the third day out his ship was sucked to the bottom of the sea by the power of the same unknown force that causes strange occurrences in the bermuda triangle after drifting in life preserver for 19 days 12 hours 15 minutes and three seconds he washed up on the shore of the island of the topless screaming librarians only seconds after coming ashore he encountered the librarian they call sheila where am croaked the man whose name was fred you re on the island of the topless screaming librarians shouted sheila at the top of her lungs would you like book to read now this was quite amazing to fred for starters it hurt his ears for all he had heard for 19 days 12 hours 15 minutes and three seconds was the lapping of waves and slow leak in his plaid life preserver as his mental facilities began to wake and quickly with all the screaming he found an odd conflict screaming librarians are nt they the ones who are always shush ing innocent folks in public places my this is unusual now as the librarians nurtured him to health and talked his ears off he began to appreciate the change his sad life had lead to dismal escape and was starting to turn up yet for the one thing the librarians were topless that one good screaming you can always find one and fast what was that fast he could nt catch one by the time he was healthy and fit and in need of little compassion nice word eh they were all fleet footed now fred is no idiot matter of fact he not to ignorant either so he devised plan fred decided to build mountain bike out of bits of moun tain not just an ordinary mountain bike however but one that peewee herman would envy he dug mine found ore started steel mill machine shop rubber plantation for the tires of course and factory for horns that go toot after 25 years of hard labor fred finally completed his bicycle so that he could chase the topless screaming librarians and nurses around the island of course by this time fred was too old to get up much speed or even get up for that matter by this time fred started thinking if only built red cadillac convertible instead then would nt even have to chase the screamers down they just pile in as drove by lacking catalytic converter fred decided that instead of the caddy he just attach rocket engine to his bicycle instead he had plenty of rocket engines since they kept falling off the space shuttles that flew overhead after two more years of tinkering fred finally had the engine attached and ready to burn he was all set for trial run when sheila went screaming by boobs bouncing this way and that thar she blows fred yelled as he hit the fire button shot up the side of the volcano and launched himself into beautiful parabolic trajectory completely missing sheila in the process must have used too much kerosene muttered fred as he roared off into the night only to find himself heading straight for another island this bothered fred he had spent much time building his bike and contemplating those topless bearers of books another thought bothered fred the thought of being smashed into sticky and slightly pulpy mess somewhere in the middle of nowhere fred had thought it would be painful but he actually liked the feel of his body being smashed onto little rock ledge overlooking lovely lake it reminded him of his childhood when he would cheerfully grind little garden snails into the sidewalk by his house fred was shocked out of his past memories by firm hand implanted on his toosh it managed about three firm squeezes before he could swing around and take look she was the most lustful item fred had ever laid eyes upon he could feel pure sex emitting from every portion of her sleek firm and nude body her skin tone was deep red and two cute little horns were perched on top her head this did not seem odd to fred for he was too mesmerized by this mass of pure lust she squeezed three more times before she slowly opened her sensuous mouth to speak da plane da plane and out from behind the only palm tree evident on the island steps small annoying midget followed by tall dark man who looks like he be more at home selling luxury cars on tv he whips out ceti eel and is starting to argue the relative merits of this eel the only indigenous animal on this island over the babel fish presently interned in fred right ear while simulta neously muttering epitaphs about someone named kurt who sup posedly stranded him on this island 15 years ago when marla sud denly releases fred backside and falls screaming into the lake meanwhile fred wastes no time in taking this sudden opportunity and follows her but just as he is about to hit the water he suddenly sees his lost plaid almost spent life preserver float ing on the surface and is so distracted that he misses hitting the water and finds himself bobbing several feet above the sur face of the lake suddenly shot rang out fred fell into the water scream ing in pain his screams were shortlived as was he when the crocodile came out and started to gnaw on his well we wont say what it was for the record it was in fact his left big toe he grabbed hold of the illustrious green creature by the jaws and pushed them wide apart the big croc was struggling to get out of his new masters hold when all of sudden fred rea lized he really was nt very manly and let the croc shut its jaws the shutting of the jaws was at such force that it caused the croc to propel itself backward at many miles an hour so heres fred all alone underwater with nothing else around him except lots of water so he sat down on rock that was behind him and started to whistle as hard as it is underwater his whistling caused the rock to open up fred crawled inside the opening and sat amazed as the water drained out leaving him in small damp room with green stucco walls and portraits of jerry falwell as soon as fred regained his senses from his incredibly hazardous bike ride he looked around and checked out his sur roundings the first thing he noticed was large green door with large green handle set into the small green wall between two mediumsized pictures of jerry falwell fred opened the door only to find long winding staircase which he started to descend after travelling several hundred yards straight down fred heard voice and the voice said no parking in the red zone fred puzzled over this for many years without ever figuring out what it meant finally the passage opened out into huge underground cavern filled with old beauticians eating tv dinners and watching reruns of laverne shirley on the 106 televisions scattered about the cavern he looked into the eyes of one old crone and she said what the hell are you doing here very loudly and pulling out macaroni cheese tv dinner fred found that tv dinners can be painful if thrown at high velocities at the very moment fred screamed in pain all the hags in the room jumped up and ran over to him all the women piled on fred licking up the macaroni cheese fred thought this was all fine and dandy until he noticed that his cloths were now being consumed in an attempt to get back at these wenches he started taking bites of every skirt that came close to his mouth pop fizzzzzz one of the ladies was zipping around the room as she deflated ooops thought fred must of bit too hard but then being in this precarious situation and being in need of solution he continued biting until all the ravenous rubber replications had all but spun and spurted and shot about the room coming to rest on rocky protrusions now more fully at rest he demanded an explanation from the remaining live beautician but not too surprising she disap peared in cloud of evil magic smoke with cackle and chortle leaving nothing save green brush and some evergrip hair pins tm given moment to collect his thoughts task he has often enough been called upon to perform lately he became hungry and feasted on the many dinners piled around him they were fair to middlin if one ignored all those sharp edges that had dealt him such wraith after his tv dinner feast every one of the 204 tv he found more had suddenly changed to new station which was in 3d commercial featuring max headroom advertising for pepsi max had finally tasted it and found how much better it was and defected reached out to fred and dragged him into the 23 inch tv he then found himself in an angry state max what go into you you meathead having said the secret password max began spouting off confidential soviet information along with pepsi jingles holy grail exclaimed fred realizing that max had been brainwashed he began the tedious process of bringing max back to his senses while voluptuous librarian with minor in ste nography took notes on the secret data when max was recovered he became flushed with embarrassment at his belief in the soviet system and then at the full realization of his sin of promoting pepsi immediately left the picture fred found himself alone with brilliant background of par allel lines in constant motion unfortunately the librarians became bored and fred was forced to keep the entertained for fear of them changing the channel by zapping himself with the current with ran through the tv sets the hair stood on end the eyes bugged out the clothes turned black and the apple in his pocket started moving not knowing how he ever got such an apple into his pocket in the first place he pulled it out of the decaying pocket to his surprise the apple had arms and legs that were squirming this way and that away from his surprise and to his horror though the apple showed the face of tammy faye bakker aaargh he screamed the agony was horrible he tried to rid himself of the strange fruit but it seemed to be stuck to his hand he grabbed it with his other hand in an attempt to pull it off but that hand stuck as well he could neither pull his hands nor his gaze from the unholy visage tammy called to him fred in that dreamy gospel singer voice fred eat me and you shall know wonders unseen to any other man no shit said fred heard all about jim extramarital homosexual bestial relations but fred knew he was doomed unless the calvary wait there it was that unmistakable sound of bugles and hoofbeats up charged donna rice and fawn hall on silver stallions ok they were just well hung lawyers they wupped out their silver 45s and with infinite finesse they cleaved the apple in two they dismounted and speaking of mounting as related by jeff hunter bos midnight programmer chris moritz dr science stimy and murphy smoot layout 000 rb aú aú another file
