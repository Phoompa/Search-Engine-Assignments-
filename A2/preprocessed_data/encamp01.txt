saturday night at the shindar encampment by lucillus dedicated to balty and his boys saturday night at the shindar encampment is like being nowhere at all they crawl in their bedrolls precisely at ten and the munchkins who live there are not seen again just two drunken romans who ca nt find their own tents sit by their fire in daze in daze and huddle together to share last bottle and wonder at strange shindar ways you ask how know of the shindar encampment well spent month there one day they ve got entertainment to dazzle your eyes go watch the boys bauble and hear their shrill cries but do nt go there drinking you ll live to regret it they re so much more boring to see boring to see so take my advice on the shindar encampment and learn to avoid it like me you might think if you hear the song that singing that hate the shindar but no your young shining faces make life seem so new they remind of times when felt that way too so despite the temptation wo nt make judgement and call all you young kids naive so naive just remember instead that next time you judge someone things might not be what you believe note you may have noticed that have never sun ght third verse and have almost decided to ditch it since it does nt really seem to fit in with the humorous tone of the rest of the song but do nt like people who preach at me or are selfrighteous about their beliefs and sure you guys do nt either so have nt sung it at you thank god for small favors eh
