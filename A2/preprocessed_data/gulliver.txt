from captain gulliver to his cousin sympson hope you will be ready to own publicly whenever you shall be called to it that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to publish very loose and uncorrect account of my travels with direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put them in order and correct the style as my cousin dampier did by my advice in his book called voyage round the world but do not remember gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted and much less that any thing should be inserted therefore as to the latter do here renounce every thing of that kind particularly paragraph about her majesty the late queen anne of most pious and glorious memory although did reverence and esteem her more than any of human species but you or your interpolator ought to have considered that as it was not my inclination so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master houyhnhnm and besides the fact was altogether false for to my knowledge being in england during some part of her majesty reign she did govern by chief minister nay even by two successively the first whereof was the lord of godolphin and the second the lord of oxford so that you have made me say the thing that was not likewise in the account of the academy of projectors and several passages of my discourse to my master houyhnhnm you have either omitted some material circumstances or minced or changed them in such manner that do hardly know my own work when formerly hinted to you something of this in letter you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving offense that people in power were very watchful over the press and apt not only to interpret but to punish every thing which looked like an innuendo as think you called it but pray how could that which spoke so many years ago and at about five thousand leagues distance in another reign be applied to any of the yahoos who now are said to govern the herd especially at time when little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under them have not the most reason to complain when see these very yahoos carried by houyhnhnms in vehicle as if these were brutes and those the rational creatures and indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable sight was one principal motive of my retirement hither thus much thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself and to the trust reposed in you do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of you and some others very much against my own opinion to suffer my travels to be published pray bring to your mind how often desired you to consider when you insisted on the motive of public good that the yahoos were species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precepts or examples and so it hath proved for instead of seeing full stop put to all abuses and corruptions at least in this little island as had reason to expect behold after above six months warning can not learn that my book hath produced one single effect according to my intentions desired you would let me know by letter when party and faction were extinguished judges learned and upright pleaders honest and modest with some tincture of common sense and smithfield blazing with pyramids of lawbooks the young nobility education entirely changed the physicians banished the female yahoos abounding in virtue honour truth and good sense courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept wit merit and learning rewarded all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and thousand other reformations firmly counted upon by your encouragement as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my book and it must be owned that seven months were sufficient time to correct every vice and folly to which yahoos are subject if their natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom yet so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels and keys and reflections and memoirs and second parts wherein see myself accused of reflecting upon great statesfolk of degrading human nature for so they have still the confidence to style it and of abusing the female sex find likewise that the writers of those bundles are not agreed among themselves for some of them will not allow me to be author of my own travels and others make me author of books to which am wholly stranger find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to confound the times and mistake the dates of my several voyages and returns neither assigning the true year or the true month or day of the month and hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my book neither have any copy left however have sent you some corrections which you may insert if ever there should be second edition and yet can not stand to them but shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please hear some of our seayahoos find fault with my sealanguage as not proper in many parts nor now in use can not help it in my first voyages while was young was instructed by the oldest mariners and learned to speak as they did but have since found that the seayahoos are apt like the land ones to become newfangled in their words which the latter change every year insomuch as remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered that could hardly understand the new and observe when any yahoo comes from london out of curiosity visit me at my own house we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in manner intelligible to the other lettertosympson paragraph if the censure of yahoos could any way affect me should have great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my book of travels mere fiction out of my own brain and have gone so far as to drop hints that the houyhnhnms and yahoos have no more existence than the inhabitants of utopia indeed must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously brobdingnag and laputa have never yet heard of any yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts have related concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with conviction and is there less probability in my account of the houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are so many thousands even in this city who only differ from their brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use sort of jabber and do not go naked wrote for their amendment and not their approbation the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms keep in my stable because from these degenerate as they are still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice do these miserable animals presume to think that am so far degenerated as to defend my veracity yahoo as am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious master was able in the compass of two years although confess with the utmost difficulty to remove that infernal habit of lying shuffling deceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species especially the europeans have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion but forbear troubling myself or you any further must freely confess that since my last return some corruptions of my yahoo nature have revived in me by conversing with few of your species and particularly those of my own family by an unavoidable necessity else should never have attempted so absurd project as that of reforming the yahoo race in this kingdom but have now done with all visionary schemes for ever april 1727 publishersletter the publisher to the reader the author of these travels mr lemuel gulliver is my ancient and intimate friend there is likewise some relation between us by the mother side about three years ago mr gulliver growing weary of the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in redriff made small purchase of land with convenient house near newark in nottinghamshire his native country where he now lives retired yet in good esteem among his neighbors although mr gulliver was born in nottinghamshire where his father dwelt yet have heard him say his family came from oxfordshire to confirm which have observed in the churchyard at banbury in that county several tombs and monuments of the gullivers before he quitted redriff he left the custody of the following papers in my hands with the liberty to dispose of them as should think fit have carefully perused them three times the style is very plain and simple and the only fault find is that the author after the manner of travelers is little too circumstantial there is an air of truth apparent through the whole and indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity that it became sort of proverb among his neighbors at redriff when any one affirmed thing to say it was as true as if mr gulliver had spoke it by the advice of several worthy persons to whom with the author permission communicated these papers now venture to send them into the world hoping they may be at least for some time better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common scribbles of politics and party this volume would have been at least twice as large if had not made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in storms in the style of sailors likewise the account of the longitudes and latitudes wherein have reason to apprehend that mr gulliver may be little dissatisfied but was resolved to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of readers however if my own ignorance in seaaffairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes alone am answerable for them and if any traveler hath curiosity to see the whole work at large as it came from the hand of the author shall be ready to gratify him publishersletter paragraph as for any further particulars relating to the author the reader will receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book richard sympson part voyage to lilliput see plate p1ch1 chapter my father had small estate in nottinghamshire was the third of five sons he sent me to emanuel college in cambridge at fourteen years old where resided three years and applied myself close to my studies but the charge of maintaining me although had very scanty allowance being too great for narrow fortune was bound apprentice to mr james bates an eminent surgeon in london with whom continued four years and my father now and then sending me small sums of money laid them out in learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics useful to those who intend to travel as always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do when left mr bates went down to my father where by the assistance of him and my uncle john and some other relations got forty pounds and promise of thirty pounds year to maintain me at leyden there studied physic two years and seven months knowing it would be useful in long voyages soon after my return from leyden was recommended by my good master mr bates to be surgeon to the swallow captain abraham pannell commander with whom continued three years and half making voyage or two into the levant and some other parts when came back resolved to settle in london to which mr bates my master encouraged me and by him was recommended to several patients took part of small house in the old jury and being advised to alter my condition married mrs mary burton second daughter to mr edmund burton hosier in newgatestreet with whom received four hundred pounds for portion but my good master bates dying in two years after and having few friends my business began to fail for my conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren having therefore consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintance determined to go again to sea was surgeon successively in two ships and made several voyages for six years to the east and west indies by which got some addition to my fortune my hours of leisure spent in reading the best authors ancient and modern being always provided with good number of books and when was ashore in observing the manners and dispositions of the people well as learning their language wherein had great facility by the strength of my memory the last of these voyages not proving very fortunate grew weary of the sea and intended to stay at home with my wife and family removed from the old jury to fetterlane and from thence to wapping hoping to get business among the sailors but it would not turn to account after three years expectation that things would mend accepted an advantageous offer from captain william prichard master of the antelope who was making voyage to the southsea we set sail from bristol may 1699 and our voyage at first was very prosperous it would not be proper for some reasons to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas let it suffice to inform him that in our passage from thence to the east indies we were driven by violent storm to the northwest of van diemen land by an observation we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees minutes south twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labor and ill food the rest were in very weak condition on the fifth of november which was the beginning of summer in those parts the weather being very hazy the seamen spied rock within half cable length of the ship but the wind was so strong that we were driven directly upon it and immediately split six of the crew of whom was one having let down the boat into the sea made shift to get clear of the ship and the rock we rowed by my computation about three leagues till we were able to work no longer being already spent with labor while we were in the ship we therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves and in about half an hour the boat was overset by sudden flurry from the north what became of my companions in the boat as well as of those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel can not tell but conclude they were all lost for my own part swam as fortune directed me and was pushed forward by wind and tide often let my legs drop and could feel no bottom but when was almost gone and able to struggle no longer found myself within my depth and by this time the storm was much abated the declivity was so small that walked near mile before got to the shore which conjectured was about eight oclock in the evening then advanced forward near half mile but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants at least was in so weak condition that did not observe them was extremely tired and with that and the heat of the weather and about half pint of brandy that drank as left the ship found myself much inclined to sleep lay down on the grass which was very short and soft where slept sounder than ever remember to have done in my life and as reckoned above nine hours for when awakened it was just daylight attempted to rise but was not able to stir for as happened to he on my back found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground and my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body from my armpits to my thighs could only look upwards the sun began to grow hot and the light offended my eyes heard confused noise about me but in the posture lay could see nothing except the sky in little time felt something alive moving on my left leg which advancing gently forward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bending my eyes downwards as much as could perceived it to be human creature not six inches high with bow and arrow in his hands and quiver at his back in the meantime felt at least forty more of the same kind as conjectured following the first was in the utmost astonishment and roared so loud that they all ran back in fright and some of them as was afterwards told were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground however they soon returned and one of them who ventured so far as to get full sight of my face lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration cried out in shrill but distinct voice hekinah degul the others repeated the same words several times but then knew not what they meant lay all this while as the reader may believe in great uneasiness at length struggling to get loose had the fortune to break the strings and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground for by lifting it up to my face discovered the methods they had taken to bind me and at the same time with violent pull which gave me excessive pain little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side so that was just able to turn my head about two inches but the creatures ran off second time before could seize them whereupon there was great shout in very shrill accent and after it ceased heard one of them cry aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant felt above hundred arrows discharged on my left hand which pricked me like so many needles and besides they shot another flight into the air as we do bombs in europe whereof many suppose fell on my body though felt them not and some on my face which immediately covered with my left hand when this shower of arrows was over fell groaning with grief and pain and then striving again to get loose they discharged another volley larger than the first and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides but by good luck had on me buff jerkin which they could not pierce thought it the most prudent method to lie still and my design was to continue so till night when my left hand being already loose could easily free myself and as for the inhabitants had reason to believe might be match for the greatest armies they could bring against me if they were all of the same size with him that saw but fortune disposed otherwise of me when the people observed was quiet they discharged no more arrows but by the noise heard knew their numbers increased and about four yards from me over against my right ear heard knocking for above an hour like that of people at work when turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would permit me saw stage erected about foot and half from the ground capable of holding four of the inhabitants with two or three ladders to mount it from whence one of them who seemed to be person of quality made me long speech whereof understood not one syllable but should have mentioned that before the principal person began his oration he cried out three times langro dehul san these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right and of observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak he appeared to be of middle age and taller than any of the other three who attended him whereof one was page that held up his train and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger the other two stood one on each side to support him he acted every part of an orator and could observe many periods of threatenings and others of promises pity and kindness answered in few words but in the most submissive manner lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun as calling him for witness and being almost famished with hunger having not eaten morsel for some hours before left the ship found the demands of nature so strong upon me that could not forbear showing my impatience perhaps against the strict rules of decency by putting my finger frequently on my mouth to signify that wanted food the hurgo for so they call great lord as afterwards learned understood me very well he descended from the stage and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my sides on which above hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth laden with baskets full of meat which had been provided and sent thither by the king orders upon the first intelligence he received of me observed there was the flesh of several animals but could not distinguish them by the taste there were shoulders legs and loins shaped like those of mutton and very well dressed but smaller than the wings of lark ate them by two or three at mouthful and took three loaves at time about the bigness of musket bullets they supplied me as they could showing thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite then made another sign that wanted drink they found by my eating that small quantity would not suffice me and being most ingenious people they slung up with great dexterity one of their largest hogsheads then rolled it toward my hand and beat out the top drank it off at draught which might well do for it did not hold half pint and tasted like small wine of burgundy but much more delicious they brought me second hogshead which drank in the same manner and made signs for more but they had none to give me when had performed these wonders they shouted for joy and danced upon my breast repeating several times as they did at first hekinah degul they made me sign that should throw down the two hogsheads but first warning the people below to stand out of the way crying aloud borach mivola and when they saw the vessels in the air there was universal shout of hekinah degul confess was often tempted while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground but the remembrance of what had felt which probably might not be the worst they could do and the promise of honor made them for so interpreted my submissive behavior soon drove out these imaginations besides now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality to people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence however in my thoughts could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals who dare venture to mount and walk upon my body while one of my hands was at liberty without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious creature as must appear to them after some time when they observed that made no more demands for meat there appeared before me person of high rank from his imperial majesty his excellency having mounted on the small of my right leg advanced forwards up to my face with about dozen of his retinue and producing his credentials under the signet royal which he applied close to my eyes spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger but with kind of determinate resolution often pointing forwards which as afterwards found was towards the capital city about half mile distant whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that must be conveyed answered in few words but to no purpose and made sign with my hand that was loose putting it to the other but over his excellency head for fear of hurting him or his train and then to my own head and body to signify that desired my liberty it appeared that he understood me well enough for he shook his head by way of disapprobation and held his hand in posture to show that must be carried as prisoner however he made other signs to let me understand that should have meat and drink enough and very good treatment whereupon once more thought of attempting to break my bonds but again when felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands which were all in blisters and many of the darts still sticking in them and observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased upon this the hurgo and his train withdrew with much civility and cheerful countenances soon after heard general shout with frequent repetitions of the words peplom selan and felt great numbers of the people on my left side relaxing the cords to such degree that was able to turn upon my right and to ease myself with making water which very plentifully did to the great astonishment of the who conjecturing by my motions what was going to do immediately opened to the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell with such noise and violence from me but before this they had daubed my face and both my hands with sort of ointment very pleasant to the smell which in few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows these circumstances added to the refreshment had received by their victuals and drink which were very nourishing disposed me to sleep slept about eight hours as was afterwards assured and it was no wonder for the physicians by the emperor order had mingled sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine p1ch1 paragraph it seems that upon the first moment was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing the emperor had early notice of it by an express and determined in council that should be tied in the manner have related which was done in the night while slept that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me and machine prepared to carry me to the capital city this resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous and am confident would not be imitated by any prince in europe on the like occasion however in my opinion it was extremely prudent as well as generous for supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with their spears and arrows while was asleep should certainly have awakened with the first sense of smart which might so far have roused my rage and strength as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith was tied after which as they were not able to make resistance so they could expect no mercy these people are most excellent mathematicians and arrived to great perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the emperor who is renowned patron of learning this prince has several machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great weights he often builds his largest men of war whereof some are nine feet long in the woods where the timber grows and has them carried on these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the greatest engine they had it was frame of wood raised three inches from the ground about seven feet long and four wide moving upon twentytwo wheels the shout heard was upon the arrival of this engine which it seems set out in four hours after my landing it was brought parallel to me as lay but the principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle eighty poles each of one foot high were erected for this purpose and very strong cords of the bigness of packthread were fastened by hooks to many bandages which the workmen had girt round my neck my hands my body and my legs nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on the poles and thus in less than three hours was raised and slung into the engine and there tied fast all this was told for while the whole operation was performing lay in profound sleep by the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor fifteen hundred of the emperor largest horses each about four inches and half high were employed to draw me towards the metropolis which as said was half mile distant about four hours after we began our journey awaked by very ridiculous accident for the carriage being stopped while to adjust something that was out of order two or three of the young natives had the curiosity to see how looked when was asleep they climbed up into the engine and advancing very softly to my face one of them an officer in the guards put the sharp end of his halfpike good way up into my left nostril which tickled my nose like straw and made me sneeze violently whereupon they stole off unperceived and it was three weeks before knew the cause of my awaking so suddenly we made long march the remaining part of that day and rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of me half with torches and half with bows and arrows ready to shoot me if should offer to stir the next morning at sunrise we continued our march and arrived within two hundred yards of the city gates about noon the emperor and all his court came out to meet us but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to endanger his person by mounting on my body at the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom which having been polluted some years before by an unnatural murder was according to the zeal of those people looked on as profane and therefore had been applied to common uses and all the ornaments and furniture carried away in this edifice it was determined should lodge the great gate fronting to the north was about four feet high and almost two feet wide through which could easily creep on each side of the gate was small window not above six inches from the ground into that on the left side the king smiths conveyed fourscore and eleven chains like those that hang to lady watch in europe and almost as large which were locked to my left leg with six and thirty padlocks over against this temple on the other side of the great highway at twenty feet distance there was turret at least five feet high here the emperor ascended with many principal lords of his court to have an opportunity of viewing me as was told for could not see them it was reckoned that above hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand and in spite of my guards believe there could not be fewer than ten thousand at several times who mounted upon my body by the help of ladders but proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain of death when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cut all the strings that bound me whereupon rose up with as melancholy disposition as ever had in my life but the noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me rise and walk are not to be expressed the chains that held my left leg were about two yards long and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in semicircle but being fixed within four inches of the gate allowed me to creep in and lie at my full length in the temple p1ch2 chapter ii when found myself on my feet looked about me and must confess never beheld more entertaining prospect the country round appeared like continued garden and the inclosed fields which were generally forty feet square resembled so many beds of flowers these fields were intermingled with woods of half sting and the tallest trees as could judge appeared to be seven feet high viewed the town on my left hand which looked like the painted scene of city in theatre had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature which was no wonder it being almost two days since had last unburdened myself was under great difficulties between urgency and shame the best expedient could think of was to creep into my house which accordingly did and shutting the gate after me went as far as the length of my chain would suffer and discharged my body of that uneasy load but this was the only time was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action for which can not but hope the candid reader will give some allowance after he has maturely and impartially considered my case and the distress was in from this time my constant practice was as soon as rose to perform that business in open air at the full extent of my chain and due care was taken every morning before company came that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheelbarrows by two servants appointed for that purpose would not have dwelt so long upon circumstance that perhaps at first sight may appear not very momentous if had not thought it necessary to justify my character in point of cleanliness to the world which am told some of my maligners have been pleased upon this and other occasions to call in question when this adventure was at an end came back out of my house having occasion for fresh air the emperor was already descended from the tower and advancing on horseback towards me which had like to have cost him dear for the beast though very well trained yet wholly unused to such sight which appeared as if mountain moved before him he reared up on his hinder feet but that prince who is an excellent horseman kept his seat till his attendants ran in and held the bridle while his majesty had time to dismount when he alighted he surveyed me round with great admiration but kept without the length of my chain he ordered his cooks and butlers who were already prepared to give me victuals and drink which they pushed forward in sort of vehicle upon wheels till could reach them took these vehicles and soon emptied them all twenty of them were filled with meat and ten with liquor each of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls and emptied the liquor of ten vessels which was contained in earthen vials into one vehicle drinking it off at draught and so did with the rest the empress and young princes of the blood of both sexes attended by many ladies sat at some distance in their chairs but upon the accident that happened to the emperor horse they alighted and came near his person which am now going to describe he is taller by almost the breadth of my nail than any of his court which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders his features are strong and masculine with an austrian lip and arched nose his complexion olive his countenance erect his body and limbs well proportioned all his motions graceful and his deportment majestic he was then past his prime being twentyeight years and three quarters old of which he had reigned about seven in great felicity and generally victorious for the better convenience of beholding him lay on my side so that my face was parallel to his and he stood but three yards off however have had him since many times in my hand and therefore can not be deceived in the description his dress was very plain and simple and the fashion of it between the asiatic and the european but he had on his head light helmet of gold adorned with jewels and plume on the crest he held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself if should happen to break loose it was almost three inches long the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched with diamonds his voice was shrill but very clear and articulate and could distinctly hear it when stood up the ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently clad so that the spot they stood upon seemed to resemble petticoat spread on the ground embroidered with figures of gold and silver his imperial majesty spoke often to me and returned answers but neither of us could understand syllable there were several of his priests and lawyers present as conjectured by their habits who were commanded to address themselves to me and spoke to them in as many languages as had the least smattering of which were high and low dutch latin french spanish italian and lingua franca but all to no purpose after about two hours the court retired and was left with strong guard to prevent the impertinence and probably the malice of the rabble who were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they dare and some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as sat on the ground by the door of my house whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye but the colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands which some of his soldiers accordingly did pushing them forwards with the buttends of their pikes into my reach took them all in my right hand put five of them into my coat pocket and as to the sixth made countenance as if would eat him alive the poor man squalled terribly and the colonel and his officers were in much pain especially when they saw me take out my penknife but soon put them out of fear for looking mildly and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with set him gently on the ground and away he ran treated the rest in the same manner taking them one by one out of my pocket and observed both the soldiers and people were highly obliged at this mark of my clemency which was represented very much to my advantage at court towards night with some difficulty got into my house where lay on the ground and continued to do so about fortnight during which time the emperor gave orders to have bed prepared for me six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages and worked up in my house hundred and fifty of their beds sewn together made up the breadth and length and these were four double which however kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor that was of smooth stone by the same computation they provided me with sheets blankets and coverlets tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to hardships as as the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom it brought prodigious numbers of rich idle and curious people to see me so that the villages were almost emptied and great neglect of tillage and household affairs must have ensued if his imperial majesty had not provided by several proclamations and orders of state against this inconveniency he directed that those who had already beheld me should return home and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house without license from court whereby the secretaries of state got considerable fees p1ch2 paragraph in the meantime the emperor held frequent councils to debate what course should be taken with me and was afterwards assured by particular friend person of great quality who was looked upon to be as much in the secret as any that the court was under many difficulties concerning me they apprehended my breaking loose that my diet would be very expensive and might cause famine sometimes they determined to starve me or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows which would soon dispatch me but again they considered that the stench of so large carcass might produce plague in the metropolis and probably spread through the whole kingdom in the midst of these consultations several officers of the army went to the door of the great council chamber and two of them being admitted gave an account of my behavior to the six criminals above mentioned which made so favorable an impression in the breast of his majesty and the whole board in my behalf that an imperial commission was issued out obliging all the villages nine hundred yards round the city to deliver in every morning six beeves forty sheep and other victuals for my sustenance together with proportionable quantity of bread and wine and other liquors for the due payment of which his majesty gave assignments upon his treasury for this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes seldom except upon great occasions raising any subsidies upon his subjects who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own expense an establishment wasalso made of six hundred persons to be my domestics who had boardwages allowed for their maintenance and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door it was likewise ordered that three hundred tailors should make me suit of clothes after the fashion of the country that six of his majesty greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language and lastly that the emperor horses and those of the nobility and troops of guards should be frequently exercised in my sight to accustom themselves to me all these orders were duly put in execution and in about three weeks made great progress in learning their language during which time the emperor frequently honored me with his visits and was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me we began already to converse together in some sort and the first words learned were to express my desire that he would please give me my liberty which every day repeated on my knees his answer as could apprehend it was that this must be work of time not to be thought on without the advice of his council and that first must lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo that is swear peace with him and his kingdom however that should be used with all kindness and he advised me to acquire by my patience and discreet behavior the good opinion of himself and his subjects he desired would not take it ill if he gave orders to certain proper officers to search me for probably might carry about me several weapons which must needs be dangerous things if they answered the bulk of so prodigious person said his majesty should be satisfied for was ready to strip myself and turn out my pockets before him this delivered part in words and part in signs he replied that by the laws of the kingdom must be searched by two of his officers that he knew this could not be done without my consent and assistance that he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice as to trust their persons in my hands that whatever they took from me should be returned when left the country or paid for at the rate which would set upon them took up the two officers in my hands put them first into my coatpockets and then into every other pocket about me except my two fobs and another secret pocket had no mind should be searched wherein had some little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself in one of my fobs there was silver watch and in the other small quantity of gold in purse these gentlemen having pen ink and paper about them made an exact inventory of everything they saw and when they were through desired would set them down that they might deliver it to the emperor this inventory afterwards translated that into english and is word for word as follows imprimis in the right coat pocket of the great man mountain for so interpret the words quinbus flestrin after the strictest search we found only one great piece of coarse cloth large enough to be foot cloth for your majesty chief room of state in the left pocket we saw huge silver chest with cover of the same metal which we the searchers were not able to lift we desired it should be opened and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the mid leg in sort of dust some part whereof flying up to our faces set us both sneezing for several times together in his right waistcoat pocket we found prodigious bundle of white thin substances folded one over another about the bigness of three men tied with strong cable and marked with black figures which we humbly conceive to be writings every letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands in the left there was sort of engine from the back of which were extended twenty long poles resembling the palisades before your majesty court wherewith we conjecture the manmountain combs his head for we did not always trouble him with questions because we found it great difficulty to make him understand us in the large pocket on the right side of his middle cover so translate the word ranfulo by which they meant my breeches we saw hollow pillar of iron about the length of man fastened to strong piece of timber larger than the pillar and upon one side of the pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out cut into strange figures which we know not what to make of in the left pocket another engine of the same kind in the smaller pocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal of different bulk some of the white which seemed to be silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and could hardly lift them in the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped we could not without difficulty reach the top of them as we stood at the bottom of his pocket one of them was covered and seemed all of piece but at the upper end of the other there appeared white round substance about twice the bigness of our heads within each of these was enclosed prodigious plate of steel which by our orders we obliged him to show us because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines he took them out of their cases and told us that in his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of these and to cut his meat with the other there were two pockets which we could not enter these he called his fobs they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly out of the right fob hung great silver chain with wonderful kind of engine at the bottom we directed him to draw out whatever was fastened to that chain which appeared to be globe half silver and half of some transparent metal for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn and thought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance he put this engine to our ears which made an incessant noise like that of watermill and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal or the god that he worships but we are more inclined to the latter opinion because he assured us if we understood him right for he expressed himself very imperfectly that he seldom did anything without consulting it he called it his oracle and said it pointed out the time for every action of his life from the left fob he took out net almost large enough for fisherman but contrived to open and shut like purse and serve him for the same use we found therein several massy pieces of yellow metal which if they be real gold must be of immense value having thus in obedience to your majesty commands diligently searched all his pockets we observed girdle about his waist made of the hide of some prodigious animal from which on the left side hung sword of the length of five men and on the right bag or pouch divided into two cells each cell capable of holding three of your majesty subjects in one of these cells were several globes or balls of most ponderous metal about the bigness of our heads and requiring strong hand to lift them the other cell contained heap of certain black grains but of no great bulk or weight for we could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands this is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the manmountain who used us with great civility and due respect to your majesty commission signed and sealed on the fourth day of the eightyninth moon of your majesty auspicious reign p1ch2 paragraph 10 clefren frelock marsi frelock when this inventory was read over to the emperor he directed me although in very gentle terms to deliver up the several particulars he first called for my scimitar which took out scabbard and all in the meantime he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops who then attended him to surround me at distance with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge but did not observe it for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his majesty he then desired me to draw my scimitar which although it had got some rust by the sea water was in most parts exceeding bright did so and immediately all the troops gave shout between terror and surprise for the sun shone clear and the reflection dazzled their eyes as waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand his majesty who is most magnanimous prince was less daunted than could expect he ordered me to return it into the scabbard and cast it on the ground as gently as could about six foot from the end of my chain the next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars by which he meant my pocketpistols drew it out and at his desire as well as could expressed to him the use of it and charging it only with powder which by the closeness of my pouch happened to escape wetting in the sea an inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care to provide first cautioned the emperor not to be afraid and then let it off in the air the astonishment here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar hundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead and even the emperor although he stood his ground could not recover himself in some time delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as had done my scimitar and then my pouch of powder and bullets begging him that the former might be kept from the fire for it would kindle with the smallest spark and blow up his imperial palace into the air likewise delivered up my watch which the emperor was very curious to see and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on pole upon their shoulders as draymen in england do barrel of ale he was amazed at the continual noise it made and the motion of the minutehand which he could easily discern for their sight is much more acute than ours and asked the opinions of his learned men about him which were various and remote as the reader may well imagine without my repeating although indeed could not very perfectly understand them then gave up my silver and copper money my purse with nine large pieces of gold and some smaller ones my knife and razor my comb and silver snuffbox my handkerchief and journalbook my scimitar pistols and pouch were conveyed in carriages to his majesty stores but the rest of my goods were returned me had as before observed one private pocket which escaped their search wherein there was pair of spectacles which sometimes use for the weakness of my eyes pocket perspective and several other little conveniences which being of no consequence to the emperor did not think myself bound in honor to discover and apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if ventured them out of my possession p1ch3 chapter iii my gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the emperor and his court and indeed upon the army and people in general that began to conceive hopes of getting my liberty in short time took all possible methods to cultivate this favorable disposition the natives came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me would sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand and last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide and seek in my hair had now made good progress in understanding and speaking their language the emperor had mind one day to entertain me with several of the country shows wherein they exceeded all nations have known both for dexterity and magnificence was diverted with none so much as that of the ropedancers performed upon slender white thread extended about two feet and twelve inches from the ground upon which shall desire liberty with the reader patience to enlarge little this diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates for great employments and high favors at court they are trained in this art from their youth and are not always of noble birth or liberal education when great office is vacant either by death or disgrace which often happens five or six of those candidates petition the emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with dance on the rope and whoever jumps the highest without falling succeeds in the office very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their skill and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty flimnap the treasurer is allowed to cut caper on the straight rope at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire have seen him do the summerset several times together upon trencher fixed on the rope which is no thicker than common packthread in england my friend reldresal principal secretary for private affairs is in my opinion if am not partial the second after the treasurer the rest of the great officers are much upon par these diversions are often attended with fatal accidents whereof great numbers are on record myself have seen two or three candidates break limb but the danger is much greater when the ministers themselves are commanded to show their dexterity for by contending to excell themselves and their fellows they strain so far that there is hardly one of them who has not received fall and some of them two or three was assured that year or two before my arrival flimnap would have infallibly broken his neck if one of the king cushions that accidentally lay on the ground had not weakened the force of his fall there is likewise another diversion which is only shown before the emperor and empress and first minister upon particular occasions the emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long one is blue the other red and the third green these threads are proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has mind to distinguish by peculiar mark of his favor the ceremony is performed in his majesty great chamber of state where the candidates are to undergo trial of dexterity very different from the former and such as have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the old or the new world the emperor holds stick in his hands both ends parallel to the horizon while the candidates advancing one by one sometimes leap over the stick sometimes creep under it backwards and forwards several times according as the stick is advanced or depressed sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick and his first minister the other sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself whoever performs his part with most agility and holds out the longest in leaping and creeping is rewarded with the bluecolored silk the red is given to the next and the green to the third which they all wear girt twice round about the middle and you see few great persons about this court who are not adorned with one of these girdles the horses of the army and those of the royal stables having been daily led before me were no longer shy but would come up to my very feet without starting the riders would leap them over my hand as held it on the ground and one of the emperor huntsmen upon large courser took my foot shoe and all which was indeed prodigious leap had the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after very extraordinary manner desired he would order several sticks two feet high and the thickness of an ordinary cane to be brought me whereupon his majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages drawn by eight horses to each took nine of these sticks and fixing them firmly in the ground in quadrangular figure two feet and half square took four other sticks and tied them parallel at each corner about two feet from the ground then fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of drum and the four parallel sticks rising about five inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side when had finished my work desired the emperor to let troop of his best horse twentyfour in number come and exercise upon this plain his majesty approved of the proposal and took them up one by one in my hands ready mounted and armed with the proper officers to exercise them as soon as they got into order they divided into two parties performed mock skirmishes discharged blunt arrows drew their swords fled and pursued attacked and retired and in short discovered the best military discipline ever beheld the parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling over the stage and the emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage from whence she was able to take full view of the whole performance it was my good fortune that no ill accident happened in these entertainments only once fiery horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his hoof struck hole in my handkerchief and his foot slipping he overthrew his rider and himself but immediately relieved them both and covering the hole with one hand set down the troop with the other in the same manner as took them up the horse that fell was strained in the left shoulder but the rider got no hurt and repaired my handkerchief as well as could however would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises p1ch3 paragraph about two or three days before was set at liberty as was entertaining the court with these kind of feats there arrived an express to inform his majesty that some of his subjects riding near the place where was first taken up had seen great black substance lying on the ground very oddly shaped extending its edges round as wide as his majesty bedchamber and rising up in the middle as high as man that it was no living creature as they at first apprehended for it lay on the grass without motion and some of them had walked round it several tunes that by mounting upon each other shoulders they had got to the top which was flat and even and stamping upon it they found it was hollow within that they humbly conceived it might be something belonging to the manmountain and if his majesty pleased they would undertake to bring it with only five horses presently knew what they meant and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence it seems upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck was in such confusion that before came to the place where went to sleep my hat which had fastened with string to my head while was rowing and had stuck on all the time was swimming fell off after came to land the string as conjecture breaking by some accident which never observed but thought my hat had been lost at sea entreated his imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as possible describing to him the use and the nature of it and the next day the wagoners arrived with it but not in very good condition they had bored two holes in the brim within an inch and half of the edge and fastened two hooks in the holes these hooks were tied by long cord to the harness and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an english mile but the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level it received less damage than expected two days after this adventure the emperor having ordered that part of his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in readiness took fancy of diverting himself in very singular manner he desired would stand like colossus with my legs as far asunder as conveniently could he then commanded his general who was an old experienced leader and great patron of mine to draw up the troops in close order and march them under me the foot by twentyfour in breast and the horse by sixteen with drums beating colors flying and pikes advanced this body consisted of three thousand foot and thousand horse his majesty gave orders upon pain of death that every soldier in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my person which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from turning up their eyes as they passed under me and to confess the truth my breeches were at that time in so ill condition that they afforded some opportunities for laughter and admiration had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty that his majesty at length mentioned the matter first in the cabinet and then in full council where it was opposed by none except skyresh bolgolam who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy but it was carried against him by the whole board and confirmed by the emperor that minister was galbet or admiral of the realm very much in his master confidence and person well versed in affairs but of morose and sour complexion however he was at length persuaded to comply but prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which should be set free and to which must swear should be drawn up by himself these articles were brought to me by skyresh bolgolam in person attended by two undersecretaries and several persons of distinction after they were read was demanded to swear to the performance of them first in the manner of my own country and afterwards in the method prescribed by their laws which was to hold my right foot in my left hand to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head and my thumb on the tip of my right ear but because the reader may perhaps be curious to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that people as well as to know the articles upon which recovered my liberty have made translation of the whole instrument word for word as near as was able which here offer to the public golbasto momaren evlame gurdilo shefin mully ully gue most mighty emperor of lilliput delight and terror of the universe whose dominions extend five thousand blustrugs about twelve miles in circumference to the extremities of the globe monarch of all monarchs taller than the sons of men whose feet press down to the center and whose head strikes against the sun at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees pleasant as the spring comfortable as the summer fruitful as autumn dreadful as winter his most sublime majesty proposes to the manmountain lately arrived to our celestial dominions the following articles which by solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform p1ch3 paragraph 10 first the manmountain shall not depart from our dominions without our license under our great seal 2nd he shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our express order at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours warning to keep within their doors 3rd the said manmountain shall confine his walks to our principal high roads and not offer to walk or lie down in meadow or field of corn 4th as he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects their horses or carriages nor take any of our said subjects into his hands without their own consent 5th if an express requires extraordinary dispatch the manmountain shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse six days journey once in every moon and return the said messenger back if so required safe to our imperial presence p1ch3 paragraph 15 6th he shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of blefuscu and do his utmost to destroy their fleet which is now preparing to invade us 7th that the said manmountain shall at his times of leisure be aiding and assisting to our workmen in helping to raise certain great stones towards covering the wall of the principal park and other of our royal buildings 8th that the said manmountain shall in two moons time deliver in an exact survey of the circumference of our dominions by computation of his own paces round the coast lastly that upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles the said manmountain shall have daily allowance of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1728 of our subjects with free access to our royal person and other marks of our favor given at our palace at belfaborac the twelfth day of the ninetyfirst moon of our reign p1ch3 paragraph 20 swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and content although some of them were not so honorable as could have wished which proceeded wholly from the malice of skyresh bolgolam the high admiral whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked and was at full liberty the emperor himself in person did me the honor to be by at the whole ceremony made my acknowledgments by prostrating myself at his majesty feet but he commanded me to rise and after many gracious expressions which to avoid the censure of vanity shall not repeat he added that he hoped should prove useful servant and well deserve all the favors he had already conferred upon me or might do for the future the reader may please to observe that in the last article for the recovery of my liberty the emperor stipulates to allow me quantity of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1728 lilliputians some time after asking friend at court how they came to fix on that determinate number he told me that his majesty mathematicians having taken the height of my body by the help of quadrant and finding it to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one they concluded from the similarity of their bodies that mine must contain at least 1728 of theirs and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to support that number of lilliputians by which the reader may conceive an idea of the ingenuity of that people as well as the prudent and exact economy of so great prince p1ch4 chapter iv the first request made after had obtained my liberty was that might have license to see mildendo the metropolis which the emperor easily granted me but with special charge to do no hurt either to the inhabitants or their houses the people had notice by proclamation of my design to visit the town the wall which encompassed it is two feet and half high and at least eleven inches broad so that coach and horses may be driven very safely round it and it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet distance stepped over the great gate and passed very gently and sidering through the two principal streets only in my short waistcoat for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat walked with the utmost circumspection to avoid treading on any stragglers that might remain in the streets although the orders were very strict that all people should keep in their houses at their own peril the garret windows and tops of houses were so crowded with spectators that thought in all my travels had not seen more populous place the city is an exact square each side of the wall being five hundred feet long the two great streets which run cross and divide it into four quarters are five feet wide the lanes and alleys which could not enter but only viewed them as passed are from twelve to eighteen inches the town is capable of holding five hundred thousand souls the houses are from three to five stories the shops and markets well provided the emperor palace is in the centre of the city where the two great streets meet it is enclosed by wall of two feet high and twenty feet distant from the buildings had his majesty permission to step over this wall and the space being so wide between that and the palace could easily view it on every side the outward court is square of forty feet and includes two other courts in the inmost are the royal apartments which was very desirous to see but found it extremely difficult for the great gates from one square into another were but eighteen inches high and seven inches wide now the buildings of the outer court were at least five feet high and it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage to the pile though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone and four inches thick at the same time the emperor had great desire that should see the magnificence of his palace but this was not able to do till three days after which spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park about hundred yards distant from the city of these trees made two stools each about three feet high and strong enough to bear my weight the people having received notice second time went again through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands when came to the side of the outer court stood upon one stool and took the other in my hand this lifted over the roof and gently set it down on the space between the first and second court which was eight feet wide then stepped over the buildings very conveniently from one stool to the other and drew up the first after me with hooked stick by this contrivance got into the inmost court and lying down upon my side applied my face to the windows of the middle stories which were left open on purpose and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be imagined there saw the empress and the young princes in their several lodgings with their chief attendants about them her imperial majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me and gave me out of the window her hand to kiss but shall not anticipate the reader with farther descriptions of this kind because reserve them for greater work which is now almost ready for the press containing general description of this empire from its first erection through long series of princes with particular account of their wars and politics laws learning and religion their plants and animals their peculiar manners and customs with other matters very curious and useful my chief design at present being only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the public or to myself during residence of about nine months in that empire one morning about fortnight after had obtained my liberty reldresal principal secretary as they style him of private affairs came to my house attended only by one servant he ordered his coach to wait at distance and desired would give him an hour audience which readily consented to on account of his quality and personal merits as well as the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations at court offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation he began with compliments on my liberty said he might pretend to some merit in it but however added that if it had not been for the present situation of things at court perhaps might not have obtained it so soon for said he as flourishing condition as we may appear to be in to foreigners we labor under two mighty evils violent faction at home and the danger of an invasion by most potent enemy from abroad as to the first you are to understand that for above seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties in this empire under the names of tramecksan and slamecksan from the high and low heels on their shoes by which they distinguish themselves it is alleged indeed that the high heels are most agreeable to our ancient constitution but however this be his majesty has determined to make use of only low heels in the administration of the government and all offices in the gift of the crown as you can not but observe and particularly that his majesty imperial heels are lower at least by drurr than any of his court drurr is measure about the fourteenth part of an inch the animosities between these two parties run so high that they will neither eat nor drink nor talk with each other we compute the tramecksan or highheels to exceed us in number but the power is wholly on our side we apprehend his imperial highness the heir to the crown to have some tendency towards the highheels at least we can plainly discover one of his heels higher than the other which gives him hobble in his gait now in the midst of these intestine disquiets we are threatened with an invasion from the island of blefuscu which is the other great empire of the universe almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty for as to what we have heard you affirm that there are other kingdoms and states in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself our philosophers are in much doubt and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon or one of the stars because it is certain that hundred mortals of your bulk would in short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of his majesty dominions besides our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of lilliput and blefuscu which two mighty powers have as was going to tell you been engaged in most obstinate war for six and thirty moons past it began upon the following occasion it is allowed on all hands that the primitive way of breaking eggs before we eat them was upon the larger end but his present majesty grandfather while he was boy going to eat an egg and breaking it according to the ancient practice happened to cut one of his fingers whereupon the emperor his father published an edict commanding all his subjects upon great penalties to break the smaller end of their eggs the people so highly resented this law that our histories tell us there have been six rebellions raised on that account wherein one emperor lost his life and another his crown these civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of blefuscu and when they were quelled the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire it is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end many hundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy but the books of the bigendians have been long forbidden and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding employments during the course of these troubles the emperors of blefuscu did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors accusing us of making schism in religion by offending against fundamental doctrine of our great prophet lustrog in the fiftyfourth chapter of the blundecral which is their however is thought to be mere strain upon the text for the words are these that all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient end and which is the convenient end seems in my humble opinion to be left to every man conscience or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to determine now the bigendian exiles have found so much credit in the emperor of blefuscu court and so much private assistance and encouragement from their party here at home that bloody war has been carried on between the two empires for six and thirty moons with various success during which time we have lost forty capital ships and much greater number of smaller vessels together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers and the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours however they have now equipped numerous fleet and are just preparing to make descent upon us and his imperial majesty placing great confidence in your valor and strength has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor and to let him know that thought it would not become me who was foreigner to interfere with parties but was ready with the hazard of my life to defend his person and state against all invaders p1ch5 chapter the empire of blefuscu is an island situated to the northnortheast side of lilliput from whence it is parted only by channel of eight hundred yards wide had not yet seen it and upon this notice of an intended invasion avoided appearing on that side of the coast for fear of being discovered by some of the enemy ships who had received no intelligence of me all intercourse between the two empires having been strictly forbidden during the war upon pain of death and an embargo laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever communicated to his majesty project had formed of seizing the enemy whole fleet which as our scouts assured us lay at anchor in the harbor ready to sail with the first fair wind consulted the most experienced seamen upon the depth of the channel which they had often plumbed who told me that in the middle at highwater it was seventy glumgluffs deep which is about six feet of european measure and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs at most walked towards the northeast coast over against blefuscu and lying down behind hillock took out my small pocket perspective glass and viewed the enemy fleet at anchor consisting of about fifty men of war and great number of transports then came back to my house and gave order for which had warrant for great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron the cable was about as thick as packthread and the bars of the length and size of knitting needle trebled the cable to make it stronger and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together binding the extremities into hook having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables went back to the northeast coast and putting off my coat shoes and stockings walked into the sea in my leather jerkin about half an hour before high water waded with what haste could and swam in the middle about thirty yards till felt ground arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour the enemy was so frighted when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam to shore where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand souls then took my tackling and fastening hook to hole at the prow of each tied all the cords together at the end while was thus employed the enemy discharged several thousand arrows many of which stuck in my hands and face and besides the excessive smart gave me much disturbance in my work my greatest apprehension was for my eyes which should have infallibly lost if had not suddenly thought of an expedient kept among other little necessaries pair of spectacles in private pocket which as observed before had escaped the emperor searchers these took out and fastened as strongly as could upon my nose and thus armed went on boldly with my work in spite of the enemy arrows many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles but without any other effect further than little to discompose them now fastened all the hooks and taking the knot in my hand began to pull but not ship would stir for they were all too fast held by their anchors so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained therefore let go the cord and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors receiving above two hundred shots in my face and hands then took up the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy menofwar after me the blefuscudians who had not the least imagination of what intended were at first confounded with astonishment they had seen me cut the cables and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or fall foul on each other but when they perceived the whole fleet moving in order and saw me pulling at the end they set up such scream of grief and despair that it is almost impossible to describe or conceive when had got out of danger stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival as have formerly mentioned then took off my spectacles and waiting about an hour till the tide was little fallen waded through the middle with my cargo and arrived safe at the royal port of lilliput the emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the issue of this great adventure they saw the ships move forward in large halfmoon but could not discern me who was up to my breast in water when advanced to the middle of the channel they were yet in more pain because was under water to my neck the emperor concluded me to be drowned and that the enemy fleet was approaching in hostile manner but he was soon eased of his fears for the channel growing shallower every step made came in short time within hearing and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened cried in loud voice long live the most puissant emperor of lilliput this great prince received me at my landing with all possible encomiums and created me nardac upon the spot which is the highest title of honor among them his majesty desired would take some other opportunity of bringing all the rest of his enemy ships into his ports and so unmeasurable is the ambition of princes that he seemed to think of nothing less than reducing the whole empire of blefuscu into province and governing it by viceroy of destroying the bigendian exiles and compelling that people to break the smaller end of their eggs by which he would remain the sole monarch of the whole world but endeavored to divert him from this design by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well as justice and plainly protested that would never be an instrument of bringing free and brave people into slavery and when the matter was debated in council the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion this open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and politics of his imperial majesty that he could never forgive it he mentioned it in very artful manner at council where was told that some of the wisest appeared at least by their silence to be of my opinion but others who were my secret enemies could not forbear some expressions which by sidewind reflected on me and from this time began an intrigue between his majesty and junto of ministers maliciously bent against me which broke out in less than two months and had like to have ended in my utter destruction of so little weight are the greatest services to princes when put into the balance with refusal to gratify their passions p1ch5 paragraph about three weeks after this exploit there arrived solemn embassy from blefuscu with humble offers of peace which was soon concluded upon conditions very advantageous to our emperor wherewith shall not trouble the reader there were six ambassadors with train of about five hundred persons and their entry was very magnificent suitable to the grandeur of their master and the importance of their business when their treaty was finished wherein did them several good offices by the credit now had or at least appeared to have at court their excellencies who were privately told how much had been their friend made me visit in form they began with many compliments upon my valor and generosity invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master name and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength of which they had heard so many wonders wherein readily obliged them but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars when had for some time entertained their excellencies to their infinite satisfaction and surprise desired they would do me the honor to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master the renown of whose had so justly filled the whole world with admiration and whose royal person resolved to attend before returned to my own country accordingly the next time had the honor to see our emperor desired his general license to wait on the blefuscudian monarch which he was pleased to grant me as could plainly perceive in very cold manner but could not guess the reason till had whisper from certain person that flimnap and bolgolam had represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as mark of disaffection from which am sure my heart was wholly free and this was the first time began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and ministers it is to be observed that these ambassadors spoke to me by an interpreter the languages of both empires differing as much from each other as any two in europe and each nation priding itself upon the antiquity beauty and energy of their own tongues with an avowed contempt for that of their neighbor yet our emperor standing upon the advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet obliged them to deliver their credentials and make their speech in the lilliputian tongue and it must be confessed that from the great intercourse of trade and commerce between both realms from the continual reception of exiles which is mutual among them and from the custom in each empire to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other in order to polish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men and manners there are few persons of distinction or merchants or seamen who dwell in the maritime parts but what can hold conversation both tongues as found some weeks after when went to pay my respects to the emperor of blefuscu which in the midst of great misfortunes through the malice of my enemies proved very happy adventure to me as shall relate in its proper place the reader may remember that when signed those articles upon which recovered my liberty there were some which disliked upon account of their being too servile neither could anything but an extreme necessity have forced me to submit but being now nardac of the highest rank in that empire such offices were looked upon as below my dignity and the emperor to do him justice never once mentioned them to me however it was not long before had an opportunity of doing his majesty at least as then thought most signal service was alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door by which being suddenly awaked was in some kind of terror heard the word burglum repeated incessantly several of the emperor court making their way through the crowd entreated me to come immediately to the palace where her imperial majesty apartment was on fire by the carelessness of maid of honor who fell asleep while she was reading romance got up in an instant and orders being given to clear the way before me and it being likewise moonshine night made shift to get to the palace without trampling on any of the people found they had already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment and were well provided with buckets but the water was at some distance these buckets were about the size of large thimble and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they could but the flame was so violent that they did little good might easily have stifled it with my coat which unfortunately left behind me for haste and came away only in my leathern jerkin the case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable and this magnificent palace would have infallibly been burned down to the ground if by presence of mind unusual to me had not suddenly thought of an expedient had the evening before drunk plentifully of most delicious wine called glimigrim the blefuscudians call it flunec but ours is esteemed the better sort which is very diuretic by the luckiest chance in the world had not discharged myself of any part of it the heat had contracted by coming very near the flames and by laboring to quench them made the wine begin to operate my urine which voided in such quantity and applied so well to the proper places that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished and the rest of that noble pile which had cost so many ages in erecting preserved from destruction it was now daylight and returned to my house without waiting to congratulate with the emperor because although had done very eminent piece of service yet could not tell how his majesty might resent the manner by which had performed it for by the fundamental laws of the realm it is capital in any person of what quality soever to make water within the precincts of the palace but was little comforted by message from his majesty that he would give orders to the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form which however could not obtain and was privately assured that the empress conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what had done removed to the most distant side of the court firmly resolved that those buildings should never be repaired for her use and in the presence of her chief confidants could not forbear vowing revenge p1ch6 chapter vi although intend to leave the description of this empire to particular treatise yet in the meantime am content to gratify the curious reader with some general ideas as the common size of the natives is somewhat under six inches high so there is an exact proportion in all other animals as well as plants and trees for instance the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height the sheep an inch and half more or less their geese about the bigness of sparrow and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest which to my sight were almost invisible but nature had adapted the eyes of the lilliputians to all objects proper for their view they see with great exactness but at no great distance and to show the sharpness of their sight towards objects that are near have been much pleased with observing cook pulling lark which was not so large as common fly and young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk their tallest trees are about seven feet high mean some of those in the great royal park the tops whereof could but just reach with my fist clenched the other vegetables are in the same proportion but this leave to the reader imagination shall say but little at present of their learning which for many ages had flourished in all its branches among them but their manner of writing is very peculiar being neither from the left to the right like the europeans nor from the right to the left like the arabians nor from up to down like the chinese nor from down to up like the cascagians but aslant from one corner of the paper to the other like ladies in england they bury their dead with their heads directly downwards because they hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise again in which period the earth which they conceive to be flat will turn upside down and by this means they shall at their resurrection be found ready standing on their feet the learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine but the practice still continues in compliance to the vulgar there are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar and if they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country should be tempted to say little in their justification it is only to be wished that they were as well executed the first shall mention relates to informers all crimes against the state are punished here with the utmost severity but if the person accused makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial the accuser is immediately put to an ignominious death and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time for the danger he underwent for the hardship of his imprisonment and for all the charges he had been at in making his defense or if that fund be deficient it is largely supplied by the crown the emperor does also confer on him some public mark of his favor and proclamation is made of his innocence through the whole city they look upon fraud as greater crime than theft and therefore seldom fail to punish it with death for they allege that care and vigilance with very common understanding may preserve man goods from thieves but honesty has no fence against superior cunning and since it is necessary that there should be perpetual intercourse of buying and selling and dealing upon credit where fraud is permitted and connived at or has no law to punish it the honest dealer is always undone and the knave gets the advantage remember when was once interceding with the king for criminal who had wronged his master of great sum of money which he had received by order and ran away with and happening to tell his majesty by way of extenuation that it was only breach of trust the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer as defense the greatest aggravation of the crime and truly had little to say in return farther than the common answer that different nations had different customs for confess was heartily ashamed p1ch6 paragraph although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which all government turns yet could never observe this maxim to be put in practice by any nation except that of lilliput whoever can there bring sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his country for seventythree moons has claim to certain privileges according to his quality and condition of life with proportionable sum of money out of fund appropriated for that use he likewise acquires the title of snilpall or legal which is added to his name but does not descend to his posterity and these people thought it prodigious defect of policy among us when told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties without any mention of reward it is upon this account that the image of justice in their courts of judicature is formed with six eyes two before as many behind and on each side one to signify circumspection with bag of gold open in her right hand and sword sheathed in her left to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish in choosing persons for all employments they have more regard to good morals than to great abilities for since government is necessary to mankind they believethat the common size of human understandings is fitted to some station or other and that providence never intended to make the management of public affairs mystery to be comprehended only by few persons of sublime genius of which there seldom are three born in an age but they suppose truth justice temperance and the like to be in every man power the practice of which virtues assisted by experience and good intention would qualify any man for the service of his country except where course of study is required but they thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior endowments of the mind that employments could never be put into such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified and at least that the mistakes committed by ignorance in virtuous disposition would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal as the practices of man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt and had great abilities to manage and multiply and defend his corruptions in like manner the disbelief of divine providence renders man incapable of holding any public station for since kings avow themselves to be the deputies of providence the lilliputians think nothing can be more absurd than for prince to employ such men as disown the authority under which he acts in relating these and the following laws would only be understood to mean the original institutions and not the most scandalous corruptions into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man for as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on the ropes or badges of favor and distinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them the reader is to observe that they were first introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning and grew to the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction ingratitude is among them capital crime as we read it to have been in some other countries for they reason thus that whoever makes ill returns to his benefactor must needs be common enemy to the rest of mankind from whom he has received no obligation and therefore such man is not fit to live p1ch6 paragraph 10 their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ extremely from ours for since the conjunction of male and female is founded upon the great law of nature in order to propagate and continue the species the lilliputians will needs have it that men and women are joined together like other animals by the motives of concupiscence and that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural principle for which reason they will never allow that child is under any obligation to his father for begetting him or his mother for bringing him into the world which considering the miseries of human life was neither benefit itself nor intended so by his parents whose thoughts in their loveencounters were otherwise employed upon these and the like reasonings their opinion is that parents are the last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own children and therefore they have in every town public nurseries where all parents except cottagers and laborers are obliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the age of twenty moons at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments of docility these schools are of several kinds suited to different qualities and to both sexes they have certain professors well skilled in preparing children for such condition of life as befits the rank of their parents and their own capacities as well as inclinations shall say something of the male nurseries and then of the female the nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided with grave and learned professors and their several deputies the clothes and food of the children are plain and simple they are bred up in the principles of honor justice courage modesty clemency religion and love of their country they are always employed in some business except in the times of eating and sleeping which are very short and two hours for diversions consisting of bodily exercises they are dressed by men till four years of age and then are obliged to dress themselves although their quality be ever so great and the women attendants who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty perform only the most menial offices they are never suffered to converse with servants but go together in small or greater numbers to take their diversions and always in the presence of professor or one of his deputies whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice to which our children are subject their parents are suffered to see them only twice year the visit is to last but an hour they are allowed to kiss the child at meeting and parting but professor who always stands by on those occasions will not suffer them to whisper or use any fondling expressions or bring any presents of toys sweetmeats and the like the pension from each family for the education and entertainment of child upon failure of due payment is levied by the emperor officers the nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen merchants traders and handicrafts are managed proportionably after the same manner only those designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old whereas those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen which answers to one and twenty with us but the confinement is gradually lessened for the last three years in the female nurseries the young girls of quality are educated much like the males only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own sex but always in the presence of professor or deputy till they come to dress themselves which is at five years old and if it be found that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or foolish stories or the common follies practiced by chambermaids among us they are publicly whipped thrice about the city imprisoned for year and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country thus the young ladies there are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as the men and despise all personal ornaments beyond decency and cleanliness neither did perceive any difference in their education made by their difference of sex only that the exercises of the females were not altogether so robust and that some rules were given them relating to domestic life and smaller compass of learning was enjoined them for their maxim is that among people of quality wife should be always reasonable and agreeable companion because she can not always be young when the girls are twelve years old which among them is the marriageable age their parents or guardians take them home with great expressions of gratitude to the professors and seldom without tears of the young lady and her companions p1ch6 paragraph 15 in the nurseries of females of the meaner sort the children are instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex and their several degrees those intended for apprentices are dismissed at nine years old the rest are to thirteen the meaner families who have children at these nurseries are obliged besides their annual pension which is as low as possible to return to the steward of the nursery small monthly share of their gettings to be portion for the child and therefore all parents are limited in their expenses by the law for the lilliputians think nothing can be more unjust than for people in subservience to their own appetites to bring children into the world and leave the burden of supporting them on the public as to persons of quality they give security to appropriate certain sum for each child suitable to their condition and these funds are always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice the cottagers and laborers keep their children at home their business being only to till and cultivate the earth and therefore their education is of little consequence to the public but the old and discased among them are supported by hospitals for begging is trade unknown in this kingdom and here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some account of my domestics and my manner of living in this country during residence of nine months and thirteen days having head mechanically turned and being likewise forced by necessity had made for myself table and chair convenient enough out of the largest trees in the royal park two hundred seamstresses were employed to make me shirts and linen for my bed and table all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get which however they were forced to quilt together in several folds for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn their linen is usually three inches wide and three feet make piece the seamstresses took my measure as lay on the ground one standing at my neck and another at my midleg with strong cord extended that each held by the end while the third measured the length of the cord with rule an inch long then they measured my right thumb and desired no more for by mathematical computation that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist and so on to the neck and the waist and by the help of my old shirt which displayed on the ground before them for pattern they fitted me exactly three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes but they had another contrivance for taking my measure kneeled down and they raised ladder from the ground to my neck upon this ladder one of them mounted and let fall plumbline from my collar to the floor which just answered the length of my coat but my waist and arms measured myself when my clothes finished which was done in my house for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them they looked like the patchwork made by the ladies in england only that mine were all of color had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals in little convenient huts built about my house where they and their families lived and prepared me two dishes apiece took up twenty waiters in my hand and placed them on the table hundred more attended below on the ground some with dishes of meat and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on their shoulders all which the waiters above drew up as wanted in very ingenious manner by certain cords as we draw the bucket up well in europe dish of their meat was good mouthful and barrel of their liquor reasonable draught their mutton yields to ours but their beef is excellent have had sirloin so large that have been forced to make three bits of it but this is rare my servants were astonished to see me eat it bones and all as in our country we do the leg of lark their geese and turkeys usually ate at mouthful and must confess they far exceed ours of their smaller fowl could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife p1ch6 paragraph 20 one day his imperial majesty being informed of my way of living desired that himself and his royal consort with the young princes of the blood of both sexes might have the happiness as he was pleased to call it of dining with me they came accordingly and placed them upon chairs of state on my table just over against me with their guards about them flimnap the lord high treasurer attended there likewise with his white staff and observed he often looked on me with sour countenance which would not seem to regard but ate more than usual in honor to my dear country as well as to fill the court with admiration have some private reasons to believe that this visit from his majesty gave flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master that minister had always been my secret enemy though he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his nature he represented to the emperor the low condition of his treasury that he was forced to take up money at great discount that exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per cent below par that in short had cost his majesty above million and half of sprugs their greatest gold coin about the bigness of spangle and upon the whole that it would be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion of dismissing me am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady who was an innocent sufferer upon my account the treasurer took fancy to be jealous of his wife from the malice of some evil tongues who informed him that her grace had taken violent affection for my person and the courtscandal ran for some time that she once came privately to my lodging this solemnly declare to be most infamous falsehood without any grounds farther than that her grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship own she came often to my house but always publicly nor ever without three more in the coach who were usually her sister and young daughter and some particular acquaintance but this was common to many other ladies of the court and still appeal to my servants round whether they at any time saw coach at my door without knowing what persons were in it on those occasions when servant had given me notice my custom was to go immediately to the door and after paying my respects to take up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands for if there were six horses the postillion always unharnessed four and place them on table where had fixed moveable rim quite round of five inches high to prevent accidents and have often had four coaches and horses at once on my table full of company while sat in my chair leaning my face towards them and when was engaged with one set the coachmen would gently drive the others round my table have passed many an afternoon very agreeably in these conversations but defy the treasurer or his two informers will name them and let them make their best of it clustril and drunlo to prove that any person ever came to me incognito except the secretary reldresal who was sent by express command of his imperial majesty as have before related should not have dwelt so long upon this particular it had not been point wherein the reputation of great lady is so nearly concerned to say nothing of my own though then had the honor to be nardac which the treasurer himself is not for all the world knows he is only glumglum title inferior by one degree as that of marquis is to duke in england although allow he preceded me in right of his post these false informations which afterwards came to the knowledge of by an accident not proper to mention made flimnap the treasurer show his lady for some time an ill countenance and me worse and although he were at last undeceived and reconciled to her yet lost all credit with him and found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself who was indeed too much governed by that favorite p1ch7 chapter vii before proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom it may be proper to inform the reader of private intrigue which had been for two months forming against me had been hitherto all my life stranger to courts for which was unqualified by the meanness of my condition had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers but never expected to have found such terrible effects of them in so remote country governed as thought by very different maxims from those in europe when was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of blefuscu considerable person at court to whom had been very serviceable at time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his imperial majesty came to my house very privately at night in close chair and without sending his name desired admittance the chairmen were dismissed put the chair with his lordship in it into my coatpocket and giving orders to trusty servant to say was indisposed and gone to sleep fastened the door of my house placed the chair on the table according to my usual custom and sat down by it after the common salutations were over observing his lordship countenance full of concern and enquiring into the reason he desired would hear him with patience in matter that highly concerned my honor and my life his speech was to the following effect for took notes of it as soon as he left me you are to know said he that several committees of council have been lately called in the most private manner on your account and it is but two days since his majesty came to full resolution you are very sensible that skyresh bolgolam galbet or high admiral has been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival his original reasons know not but his hatred is much increased since your great success against blefuscu by which his glory as admiral is obscured this lord in conjunction with flimnap the high treasurer whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his lady limtoc the general lalcon the chamberlain and balmuff the grand justiciary have prepared articles of impeachment against you for treason and other capital crimes p1ch7 paragraph this preface made me so impatient being conscious of my own merits and innocence that was going to interrupt when he entreated me to be silent and thus proceeded out of gratitude for the favors you have done me procured information of the whole proceedings and copy of the articles wherein venture my head for your service articles of impeachment against quinbus flestrin the manmountain p1ch7 paragraph 10 article whereas by statute made in the reign of his imperial majesty calin deffar plune it is enacted that whoever shall make water within the precincts of the royal palace should be liable to the pains and penalties of high treason notwithstanding the said quinbus flestrin in open breach of the said law under color of extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his majesty most dear imperial consort did maliciously traitorously and devilishly by discharge of his urine put out the said fire kindled in the said apartment lying and being within the precincts of the said royal palace against the statute in that case provided etc against the duty etc article ii p1ch7 paragraph 15 that the said quinbus flestrin having brought the imperial fleet of blefuscu into the royal port and being afterwards commanded by his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of blefuscu and reduce that empire to province to be governed by viceroy from hence and to destroy and put to death not only all the bigendian exiles but likewise all the people of that empire who would not immediately forsake the bigendian heresy he the said flestrin like false traitor against his most auspicious serene imperial majesty did petition to be excused from the said service upon pretense of unwillingness to force the consciences or destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people article iii that whereas certain ambassadors from the court of blefuscu to sue for peace in his majesty court he the said flestrin did like false traitor aid abet comfort and divert the said ambassadors although he knew them to be servants to prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty and in open war against his said majesty p1ch7 paragraph 20 article iv that the said quinbus flestrin contrary to the duty of faithful subject is now preparing to make voyage to the court and empire of blefuscu for which he had received only verbal license from his imperial majesty and under color of the said license doth falsely and traitorously intend to take the said voyage and hereby to aid comfort and abet the emperor of blefuscu so late an enemy and in open war with his imperial majesty aforesaid there are some other articles but these are the most important of which have read you an abstract in the several debates upon this impeachment it must be confessed that his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity often urging the services you had done him and endeavoring to extenuate your crimes the treasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most painful and ignominious death by setting fire on your house at night and the general was to attend with twenty thousand men armed with poisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands some of your servants were to have private orders to strew poisonous juice on your shirts which would soon make you tear your own flesh and die in the utmost torture the general came into the same opinion so that for long time there was majority against you but his majesty resolving if possible to spare your life at last brought off the chamberlain p1ch7 paragraph 25 upon this incident reldresal principal secretary for private affairs who always approved himself your true friend was commanded by the emperor to deliver his opinion which he accordingly did and therein justified the good thoughts you have of him he allowed your crimes to be great but that still there was room for mercy the most commendable virtue in prince and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated he said the friendship between you and him was so well known to the world that perhaps the most honorable board might think him partial however in obedience to the command he had received he would freely offer his sentiments that if his majesty in consideration of your services and pursuant to his own merciful disposition would please to spare your life and only give order to put out both your eyes he humbly conceived that by this expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor as well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honor to be his counsellors that the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength by which you might still be useful to his majesty that blindness is an addition to courage by concealing dangers from us that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in bringing over the enemy fleet and it would be sufficient for you to see by the eyes of the ministers since the greatest princes do no more this proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole board bolgolam the admiral could not preserve his temper but rising up in fury said he wondered how the secretary dared presume to give his opinion for preserving the life of traitor that the services you had performed were by all true reasons of state the great aggravation of your crimes that you who were able to extinguish the fire by discharge of urine in her majesty apartment which he mentioned with horror might at another time raise an inundation by the same means to drown the whole palace and the same strength which enabled you to bring over the enemy fleet might serve upon the first discontent to carry it back that he had good reasons to think you were bigendian in your heart and as treason begins in the heart before it appears in overt acts so he accused you as traitor on that account and therefore insisted you should be put to death the treasurer was of the same opinion he showed to what straits his majesty revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you which would soon grow insupportable that the secretary expedient of putting out your eyes was so far from being remedy against this evil it would probably increase it as it is manifest from the common practice of blinding some kind of fowl after which they fed the faster and grew sooner fat that his sacred majesty and the council who are your judges were in their own consciences fully convinced of your guilt which was sufficient argument to condemn you to death without the formal proofs required by the strict letter of the law but his imperial majesty fully determined against capital punishment was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy censure some other may be inflicted hereafter and your friend the secretary humbly desiring to be heard again in answer to what the treasurer had objected concerning the great charge his majesty was at in maintaining you said that his excellency who had the sole disposal of the emperor revenue might easily provide against that evil by gradually lessening your establishment by which for want of sufficient food you would grow weak and faint and lose your appetite and consequently decay and consume in few months neither would the stench of your carcass be then so dangerous when it should become more than half diminished and immediately upon your death five or six thousand of his majesty subjects might in two or three days cut your flesh from your bones take it away by cartloads and bury it in distant parts to prevent infection leaving the skeleton as monument of admiration to posterity thus by the great friendship of the secretary the whole affair was compromised it was strictly enjoined that the project of starving you by degrees should be kept secret but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books none dissenting except bolgolam the admiral who being creature of the empress was perpetually instigated by her majesty to insist upon your death she having borne perpetual malice against you on account of that infamous and illegal method you took to extinguish the fire in her apartment p1ch7 paragraph 30 in three days your friend the secretary will be directed to come to your house and read before you the articles of impeachment and then to signify the great lenity and favor of his majesty and council whereby you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes which his majesty does not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to and twenty of his majesty surgeons will attend in order to see the operation well performed by discharging very sharppointed arrows into the balls of your eyes as you lie on the ground leave to your prudence what measures you will take and to avoid suspicion must immediately return in as private manner as came his lordship did so and remained alone under many doubts and perplexities of mind it was custom introduced by this prince and his ministry very different as have been assured from the practices of former times that after the court had decreed any cruel execution either to gratify the monarch resentment or the malice of favorite the emperor always made speech to his whole council expressing his great lenity and tenderness as qualities known and confessed by all the world this speech was immediately published through the kingdom nor did anything terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty mercy because it was observed that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on the more inhuman was the punishment and the sufferer more innocent and as to myself must confess having never been designed for courtier either by my birth or education was so ill judge of things that could not discover the lenity and favor of this sentence but conceived it perhaps erroneously rather to be rigorous than gentle sometimes thought of standing my trial for although could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles yet hoped they would admit of some extenuations but having in my life perused many state trials which ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to direct dared not rely on so dangerous decision in so critical juncture and against such powerful enemies once was strongly bent upon resistance for while had liberty the whole strength of that empire could hardly subdue me and might easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces but soon rejected that project with horror by remembering the oath had made to the emperor the favors received from him and the high title of nardac he conferred upon me neither had so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers to persuade myself that his majesty present severities quitted me of all past obligations at last fixed upon resolution for which it is probable may incur some censure and not unjustly for confess owe the preserving of my eyes and consequently my liberty to my own great rashness and want of experience because if had then known the nature of princes and ministers which have since observed in many other courts and their methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself should with great alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy punishment but hurried on by the precipitancy of youth and having his imperial majesty license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of blefuscu took this opportunity before the three days were elapsed to send letter to my friend the secretary signifying my resolution of setting out that morning blefuscu pursuant to the leave had got and without waiting for an answer went to that side of the island where our fleet lay seized large man of war tied cable to the prow and lifting up the anchors stripped myself put my clothes together with my coverlet which brought under my arm into the vessel and drawing it after me between wading and swimming arrived at the royal port of blefuscu where the people had long expected me they lent me two guides to direct me to the capital city which is of the same name held them in my hands till came within two hundred yards of the gate and desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries and let him know there waited his majesty commands had an answer in about an hour that his majesty attended by the royal family and great officers of the court was coming out to receive me advanced hundred yards the emperor and his train alighted from their horses the empress and ladies from their coaches and did not perceive they were in any fright or concern lay on the ground to kiss his majesty and the empress hand told his majesty that had come according to my promise and with the license of the emperor my master to have the honor of seeing so mighty monarch and to offer him any service in my power consistent with my duty to my own prince not mentioning word of my disgrace because had hitherto no regular information of it and might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such design neither could reasonably conceive that the emperor would discover the secret while was out of his power wherein however it soon appeared was deceived p1ch7 paragraph 35 shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my reception at this court which was suitable to the generosity of so great prince nor of the difficulties was in for want of house and bed being forced to lie on the ground wrapped up in my coverlet p1ch8 chapter viii three days after my arrival walking out of curiosity to the northeast coast of the island observed about half league off in the sea something that looked like boat overturned pulled off my shoes and stockings and wading two or three hundred yards found the object to approach nearer by force of the tide and then plainly saw it to be real boat which supposed might by some tempest have been driven from ship whereupon returned immediately towards the city and desired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left after the loss of his fleet and three thousand seamen under the command of his viceadmiral this fleet sailed round while went back the shortest way to the coast where first discovered the boat found the tide had driven it still nearer the seamen were all provided with cordage which had beforehand twisted to sufficient strength when the ships came up stripped myself and waded till came within hundred yards of the boat after which was forced to swim till got up to it the seamen threw me the end of the cord which fastened to hole in the forepart of the boat and the other end to man of war but found all my labor to little purpose for being out of my depth was not able to work in this necessity was forced to swim behind and push the boat forwards as often as could with one of my hands and the tide favoring me advanced so far that could just hold up my chin and feel the ground rested two or three minutes and then gave the boat another shove and so on till the sea was no higher than my armpits and now the most laborious part being over took out my other cables which were stowed in one of the ships and fastening them first to the boat and then to nine of the vessels which attended me the wind being favorable the seamen towed and shoved till we arrived within forty yards of the shore and waiting till the tide was out got dry to the boat and by the assistance of two thousand men with ropes and engines made shift to turn it on its bottom and found it was but little damaged shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties was under by the help of certain paddles which cost me ten days making to get my boat to the royal port of blefuscu where mighty concourse of people appeared upon my arrival full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious vessel told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place from whence might return into my native country and begged his majesty orders for getting materials to fit it up together with his license to depart which after some kind expostulations he was pleased to grant did very much wonder in all this time not to have heard of any express relating to me from our emperor to the court of blefuscu but was afterwards given privately to understand that his imperial majesty never imagining had the least notice of his designs believed was only gone to blefuscu in performance of my promise according to the license he had given me which was well known at our court and would return in few days when that ceremony was ended but he was at last in pain at my long absence and after consulting with the treasurer and the rest of that cabal person of quality was dispatched with the copy of the articles against me this envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of blefuscu the great lenity of his master who was content to punish me no farther than with the loss of my eyes that had fled from justice and if did not return in two hours should be deprived of my title of nardac and declared traitor the envoy further added that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires his master expected that his brother of blefuscu would give orders to have me sent back to lilliput bound hand and foot to be punished as traitor the emperor of blefuscu having taken three days to consult returned an answer consisting of many civilities and excuses he said that as for sending me bound his brother knew it was impossible that although had deprived him of his fleet yet he owed great obligations to me for many good offices had done him in making the peace that however both their majesties would soon be made easy for had found prodigious vessel on the shore able to carry me on the sea which he had given order to fit up with my own assistance and direction and he hoped in few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportable an incumbrance with this answer the envoy returned to lilliput and the monarch of blefuscu related to me all that had past offering me at the same time but under the strictest confidence his gracious protection if would continue in his service wherein although believed him sincere yet resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers where could possibly avoid it and therefore with all due acknowledgements for his favorable intentions humbly begged to be excused told him that since fortune whether good or evil had thrown vessel in my way was resolved to venture myself in the ocean rather than be an occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs neither did find the emperor at all displeased and discovered by certain accident that he was very glad of my resolution and so were most of his ministers p1ch8 paragraph these considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than intended to which the court impatient to have me gone very readily contributed five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my boat according to my directions by quilting thirteen fold of their strongest linen together was at the pains of making ropes and cables by twisting ten twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest of theirs great stone that happened to find after long search by the seashore served me for an anchor had the tallow of three hundred cows for greasing my boat and other uses was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest timbertrees for oars and masts wherein was however much assisted by his majesty ship carpenters who helped me in smoothing them after had done the rough work in about month when all was prepared sent to receive his majesty commands and to take my leave the emperor and royal family came out of the palace lay down on my face to kiss his hand which he very graciously gave me so did the empress and young princes of the blood his majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugs apiece together with his picture at full length which put immediately into one of my gloves to keep it from being hurt the ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at this time stored the boat with the carcases of hundred oxen and three hundred sheep with bread and drink proportionable and as much meat ready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide took with me six cows and two bulls alive with as many ewes and rams intending to carry them into my own country and propagate the breed and to feed them on board had good bundle of hay and bag of corn would gladly have taken dozen of the natives but this was thing the emperor would by no means permit and besides diligent search into my pockets his majesty engaged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects although with their own consent and desire having thus prepared all things as well as was able set sail on the twentyfourth day of september 1701 at six in the morning and when had gone about four leagues to the northward the wind being at southeast at six in the evening descried small island about half league to the northwest advanced forward and cast anchor on the leeside of the island which seemed to be uninhabited then took some refreshment and went to my rest slept well and conjecture at least six hours for found the day broke in two hours after awaked it was clear night ate my breakfast before the sun was up and heaving anchor the wind being favorable steered the same course that had done the day before wherein was directed by my pocket compass my intention was to reach if possible one of those islands which had reason to believe lay to the northeast of van diemen land discovered nothing all that day but upon the next about three in the afternoon when had by my computation made twentyfour leagues from blefuscu descried sail steering to the southeast my course was due east hailed her but could get no answer yet found gained upon her for the wind slackened made all the sail could and in half an hour she spied me then hung out her ancient and discharged gun it is not easy to express the joy was in upon the unexpected hope of once more seeing my beloved country and the dear pledges had left in it the ship slackened her sails and came up with her between five and six in the evening september 26 but my heart leaped within me to see her english colors put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions the vessel was an english merchantman returning from japan by the north and south seas the captain mr john biddle of deptford very civil man and an excellent sailor we were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south there were about fifty men in the ship and here met an old comrade of mine one peter williams who gave me good character to the captain this gentleman treated me with kindness and desired would let know what place came from last and whither was bound which did in few words but he thought was raving and that the dangers underwent had disturbed my head whereupon took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket which after great astonishment clearly convinced him of my veracity then showed him the gold given me by the emperor of blefuscu together with his majesty picture at full length and some other rarities of that country gave him two purses of two hundred sprugs each and promised when we arrived in england to make him present of cow and sheep big with young shall not trouble the reader with particular account of this voyage which was very prosperous for the most part we arrived in the downs on the 13th of april 1702 had only one misfortune that the rats on board carried away one of my sheep found her bones in hole picked clean from the flesh the rest of my cattle got safe on shore and set them grazing in bowlinggreen at greenwich where the fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily though had always feared the contrary neither could possibly have preserved them in so long voyage if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit which rubbed to powder and mingled with water was their constant food the short time continued in england made considerable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others and before began my second voyage sold them for six hundred pounds since my last return find the breed is considerably increased especially the sheep which hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen manufacture by the fineness of the fleeces p1ch8 paragraph 10 stayed but two months with my wife and family for my insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife and fixed her in good house at redriff my remaining stock carried with me part in money and part in goods in hopes to improve my fortunes my eldest uncle john had left me an estate in land near epping of about thirty pounds year and had long lease of the black bull in fetter lane which yielded me as much more so that was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the parish my son johnny named so after his uncle was at the grammar school and towardly child my daughter betty who is now well married and has children was then at her needlework took leave of my wife and boy and girl with tears on both sides and went on board the adventure merchantship of three hundred tons bound for surat captain john nicholas of liverpool commander but my account of this voyage must be referred to the second part of my travels the end of the first part part ii voyage to brobdingnag see plate p2ch1 chapter having been condemned by nature and fortune to an active and restless life in two months after my return again left my native country and took shipping in the downs on the 20th day of june 1702 in the adventure captain john nicholas cornishman commander bound for surat we had very prosperous gale till we arrived at the cape of good hope where we landed for fresh water but discovering leak we unshipped our goods and wintered there for the captain falling sick of an ague we could not leave the cape till the end of march we then set sail and had good voyage till we passed the straits of madagascar but having got northward of that island and to about five degrees south latitude the winds which in those seas are observed to blow constant equal gale between the north and west from the beginning of december to the beginning of may on the 19th of april began to blow with much greater violence and more westerly than usual continuing so for twenty days together during which time we were driven little to the east of the molucca islands and about three degrees northward of the line as our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of may at which time the wind ceased and it was perfect calm whereat was not little rejoiced but he being man well experienced in the navigation of those seas bid us all prepare against storm which accordingly happened the day following for southern wind called the southern monsoon began to set in finding it was likely to overblow we took in our spritsail and stood by to hand the foresail but making foul weather we looked the guns were all fast and handed the mizzen the ship lay very broad off so we thought it better spooning before the sea than trying or hulling we reefed the foresail and set him we hauled aft the foresheet the helm was hard aweather the ship wore bravely we belayed the foredownhaul but the sail was split and we hauled down the yard and got the sail into the ship and unbound all the things clear of it it was very fierce storm the sea broke strange and dangerous we hauled off upon the lanyard of the whipstaff and helped the man at helm we would not get down our topmast but let all stand because she scudded before the sea very well and we knew that the topmast being aloft the ship was the wholesomer and made better way through the sea seeing we had sea room when the storm was over we set foresail and mainsail and brought the ship to then we set the mizzen maintopsail and the foretopsail our course was east northeast the wind was at southwest we got the starboard tacks aboard we cast off our weatherbraces and lifts we set in the leebraces and hauled forward by the weatherbowlings and hauled them tight and belayed them and hauled over the mizzen tack to windward and kept her full and by as near as she would lie during this storm which was followed by strong wind west southwest we were carried by my computation about five hundred leagues to the east so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of the world we were our provisions held out well our ship was staunch and our crew all in good health but we lay in the utmost distress for water we thought it best to hold on the same course rather than turn more northerly which might have brought us to the northwest parts of great tartary and into the frozen sea on the 16th day of june 1703 boy on the topmost discovered land on the 17th we came in full view of great island or continent for we knew not which on the south side whereof was small neck of land jutting out into the sea and creek too shallow to hold ship of above one hundred tons we cast anchor within league of this creek and our captain sent dozen of his men well armed in the longboat with vessels for water if any could be found desired his leave to go with them that might see the country and make what discoveries could when we came to land we saw no river or spring nor any sign of inhabitants our men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea and walked alone about mile on the other side where observed the country all barren and rocky now began to be weary and seeing nothing to entertain my curiosity returned gently down towards the creek and the sea being full in my view saw our men already got into the boat and rowing for life to the ship was going to halloo after them although it had been to little purpose when observed huge creature walking after them in the sea as fast as he could he waded not much deeper than his knees and took prodigious strides but our men had the start of him half league and the sea thereabouts being full of sharppointed rocks the monster was not able to overtake the boat this was afterwards told for dared not stay to see the issue of that adventure but ran as fast as could the way first went and then climbed up steep hill which gave me some prospect of the country found it fully cultivated but that which first surprised me was the length of the grass which in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay was about twenty feet high fell into high road for so took it to be though it served to the inhabitants only as footpath through field of barley here walked on for some time but could see little on either side it being now near harvest and the corn rising at least forty feet was an hour walking to the end of this field which was fenced in with hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high and the trees so lofty that could make no computation of their altitude there was stile to pass from this field into the next it had four steps and stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost it was impossible for me to climb this stile because every step was six feet high and the upper stone above twenty was endeavoring to find some gap in the hedge when discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field advancing towards the stile of the same size with him whom saw in the sea pursuing our boat he appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple and took about ten yards at every stride as near as could guess was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself in the corn from whence saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right hand and heard him call in voice many degrees louder than speaking trumpet but the noise was so high in the air that at first certainly thought it was thunder whereupon seven monsters like himself came towards him with reaping hooks in their hands each hook about the size of six scythes these people were not so well clad as the first whose servants or laborers they seemed to be for upon some words he spoke they went to reap the corn in the field where lay kept from them at as great distance as could but was forced to move with extreme difficulty for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above foot distant so that could hardly squeeze my body between them however made shift to go forward till came to part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind here it was impossible for me to advance step for the stalks were so interwoven that could not creep through and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh at the same time heard the reapers not above hundred yards behind me being quite dispirited with toil and wholly overcome by grief and despair lay down between two ridges and heartily wished might there end my days bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children lamented my own folly and willfulness in attempting second voyage against the advice of all my friends and relations in this terrible agitation of mind could not forbear thinking of lilliput whose inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world where was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand and perform those other actions which will be recorded forever in the chronicles of that empire while posterity shall hardly believe them although attested by millions reflected what mortification it must prove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single lilliputian would be among us but this conceived was to be the least of my misfortunes for as human creatures are observed to be more savage and cruel in proportion to their bulk what could expect but to be morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me undoubtedly philosophers are in the right when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison it might have pleased fortune to let the lilliputians find some nation where the people were as diminutive with respect to them as they were to me and who knows but that even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the world whereof we have yet no discovery p2ch1 paragraph scared and confounded as was could not forbear going on with these reflections when one of the reapers approaching within ten yards of the ridge where lay made me apprehend that with the next step should be squashed to death under his foot or cut in two with his reaping hook and therefore when he was again about to move screamed as loud as fear could make me whereupon the huge creature trod short and looking round about under him for some time at last espied me as lay on the ground he considered while with the caution of one who endeavors to lay hold on small dangerous animal in such manner that it shall not be able either to scratch or to bite him as myself have sometimes done with weasel in england at length he ventured to take me up behind by the middle between his forefinger and thumb and brought me within three yards of his eyes that he might behold my shape more perfectly guessed his meaning and my good fortune gave me so much presence of mind that resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the air about sixty feet from the ground although he grievously pinched my sides for fear should slip through his fingers all ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun and place my hands together in supplicating posture and to speak some words in humble melancholy tone suitable to the condition then was in for apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground as we usually do any little hateful animal which we have mind to destroy but my good star would have it that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures and began to look upon me as curiosity much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words although he could not understand them in the meantime was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears and turning my head towards my sides letting him know as well as could how cruelly was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger he seemed to apprehend my meaning for lifting up the lappet of his coat he put me gently into it and immediately ran along with me to his master who was substantial farmer and the same person had first seen in the field the farmer having as supposed by their talk received such an account of me as his servant could give him took piece of small straw about the size of walking staff and therewith lifted up the lappets of my coat which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature had given me he blew my hair aside to take better view of my face he called his hinds about him and asked them as afterwards learned whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that resembled me he then placed me softly on the ground upon all four but got immediately up and walked slowly backwards and forwards to let those people see had no intent to run away they all sat down in circle about me the better to observe my motions pulled off my hat and made low bow towards the farmer fell on my knees and lifted up my hands and eyes and spoke several words as loud as could took purse of gold out of my pocket and humbly presented it to him he received it on the palm of his hand then applied it close to his eye to see what it was and afterwards turned it several times with the point of pin which he took out of his sleeve but could make nothing of it whereupon made sign that he should place his hand on the ground took the purse and opening it poured all the gold into his palm there were six spanish pieces of four pistoles each beside twenty or thirty smaller coins saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue and take up one of my largest pieces and then another but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were he made me sign to put them again into my purse and the purse again into my pocket which after offering to him several times thought it best to do the farmer by this time was convinced must be rational creature he spoke often to me but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like that of water mill yet his words were articulate enough answered as loud as could in several languages and he often laid his car within two yards of me but all in vain for we were wholly unintelligible to each other he then sent his servants to their work and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket he doubled and spread it on his left hand which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upwards making me sign to step into it as could easily do for it was not above foot in thickness thought it my part to obey and for fear of falling laid myself at length upon the handkerchief with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the head for further security and in this manner carried me home to his house there he called his wife and showed me to her but she screamed and ran back as women in england do at the sight of toad or spider however when she had while seen my behavior and how well observed the signs her husband made she was soon reconciled and by degrees grew extremely tender of me it was about twelve at noon and servant brought in dinner it was only one substantial dish of meat fit for the plain condition of an husbandman in dish of about twentyfour feet in diameter the company were the farmer and his wife three children and an old grandmother when they sat down the farmer placed me at some distance from him on the table which was thirty feet high from the floor was in terrible fright and kept as far as could from the edge for fear of falling the wife minced bit of meat then crumbled some bread on trencher and placed it before me made her low bow took out my knife and fork and fell to eating which gave them exceeding delight the mistress sent her maid for small dram cup which held about three gallons and filled it with drink took up the vessel with much difficulty in both hands and in most respectful manner drank to her ladyship health expressing the words as loud as could in english which made the company laugh so heartily that was almost deafened with the noise this liquor tasted like small cider and was not unpleasant then the master made me sign to come to his trencher side but as walked on the table being in great surprise all the time as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse happened to stumble against crust and fell flat on my face but received no hurt got up immediately and observing the good people to be in much concern took my hat which held under my arm out of good manners and waving it over my head made three huzzas to show had gotten no mischief by my fall but advancing forwards toward my master as shall henceforth call him his youngest son who sat next him an arch boy of about ten years old took me up by the legs and held me so high in the air that trembled every limb but his father snatched me from him and at the same time gave him such box on the left ear as would have felled an european troop of horse to the earth ordering him to be taken from the table but being afraid the boy might owe me spite and well remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to sparrows rabbits young kittens and puppy dogs fell on my knees and pointing to the boy made my master to understand as well as could that desired his son might be pardoned the father complied and the lad took his seat again whereupon went to him and kissed his hand which my master took and made him stroke me gently with it in the midst of dinner my mistress favorite cat leaped into her lap heard noise behind me like that of dozen stockingweavers at work and turning my head found it proceeded from the purring of this animal who seemed to be three times larger than an ox as computed by the view of her head and one of her paws while her mistress was feeding and stroking her the fierceness of this creature countenance altogether discomposed me though stood at the farther end of the table above fifty feet off and although my mistress held her fast for fear she might give spring and seize me in her talons but it happened there was no danger for the cat took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within three yards of her and as have been always told and found true by experience in my travels that flying or discovering fear way to make it pursue or attack you so resolved in this dangerous juncture to show no manner of concern walked with intrepidity five or six times before the very head of the cat and came within half yard of her whereupon she drew herself back as if she were more afraid of me had less apprehension concerning the dogs whereof three or four came into the room as it is usual in farmers houses one of which was mastiff equal in bulk to four elephants and greyhound somewhat taller than the mastiff but not so large p2ch1 paragraph 10 when dinner was almost done the nurse came in with child of year old in her arms who immediately spied me and began squall that you might have heard from london bridge to chelsea after the usual oratory of infants to get me for plaything the mother out of pure indulgence took me up and put me towards the child who presently seized me by the middle and got my head in his mouth where roared so loud that the urchin was frightened and let me drop and should infallibly have broken my neck if the mother had not held her apron under me the nurse to quiet her babe made use of rattle which was kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones and fastened by cable to the childs waist but all in vain so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her monstrous breast which can not tell what to compare with so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk shape and color it stood prominent six feet and could not be less than sixteen in circumference the nipple was about half the size of my head and the hue both of that and the dug so varified with spots pimples and freckles that nothing could appear more nauseous for had near sight of her she sitting down the more conveniently to give suck and standing on the table this made me reflect upon the fair skins of our english ladies who appear so beautiful to us only because they are of our own size and their defects not to be seen but through magnifying glass where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins look rough and coarse and ill colored remember when was at lilliput the complexion of those diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world and talking upon this subject with person of learning there who was an intimate friend of mine he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he looked on me from the ground than it did upon nearer view when took him up in my hand and brought him close which he confessed was at first very shocking sight he said he could discover great holes in my skin that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles of boar and my complexion made up of several colors altogether disagreeable although must beg leave to say for myself that am as fair as most of my sex and country and very little sunburned by all my travels on the other side discoursing of the ladies in that emperor court he used to tell me one had freckles another too wide mouth third too large nose nothing of which was able to distinguish confess this reflection was obvious enough which however could not forbear lest the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed for must do them justice to say they are comely race of people and particularly the features of my master countenance although he were but farmer when beheld him from the height of sixty feet appeared very well proportioned when dinner was done my master went out to his laborers and as could discover by his voice and gesture gave his wife strict charge to take care of me was very much tired and disposed to sleep which my mistress perceiving she put me on her own bed and covered me with clean white handkerchief larger and coarser than the mainsail of man of war slept about two hours and dreamed was at home with my wife and children which aggravated my sorrows when awakened and found myself alone in vast room between two and three hundred feet wide and above two hundred high lying in bed twenty yards wide my mistress was gone about her household affairs and had locked me in the bed was eight yards from the floor some natural necessities required me to get down dare not presume to call and if had it would have been in vain with such voice as mine at so great distance from the room where lay to the kitchen where the family kept while was under these circumstances two rats crept up the curtains and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed one of them came up almost to my face whereupon rose in fright and drew out my hanger to defend myself these horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides and one of them held his forefeet at my collar but had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief he fell down at my feet and the other seeing the fate of his comrade made his escape but not without one good wound on the back which gave him as he fled and made the blood run trickling from him after this exploit walked gently to and fro on the bed to recover my breath and loss of spirits these creatures were of the size of large mastiff but infinitely more nimble and fierce so that if had taken off my belt before went to sleep must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured measured the tail of the dead rat and found it to be two yards long wanting an inch but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off the bed where it lay still bleeding observed it had yet some life but with strong slash cross the neck thoroughly dispatched it soon after my mistress came into the room who seeing me all bloody ran and took me up in her hand pointed to the dead rat smiling and making other signs to show was not hurt whereat she was extremely rejoiced calling the maid to take up the dead rat with pair of tongs and throw it out of the window then she set me on table where showed her my hanger all bloody and wiping it on the lappet of my coat returned it to the scabbard was pressed to do more than one thing which another could not do for me and therefore endeavored to make my mistress understand that desired to be set down on the floor which after she had done my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself farther than by pointing to the door and bowing several times the good woman with much difficulty at last perceived what would be at and taking me up again in her hand walked into the garden where she set me down went on one side about two hundred yards and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me hid myself between two leaves of sorrel and there discharged the necessities of nature p2ch1 paragraph 15 hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the like particulars which however insignificant they may appear to grovelling vulgar minds yet will certainly help philosopher to enlarge his thoughts and imagination and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private life which was my sole design in presenting this and other accounts of my travels to the world wherein have been chiefly studious of truth without affecting any ornaments of learning or of style but the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression on my mind and is so deeply fixed in my memory that in committing it to paper did not omit one material circumstance however upon strict review blotted out several passages of less moment which were in my first copy for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling whereof travelers are often perhaps not without justice accused p2ch2 chapter ii my mistress had daughter of nine years old child of forward parts for her age very dextrous at her needle and skillful in dressing her baby her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby cradle for me against night the cradle was put into small drawer of cabinet and the drawer placed upon hanging shelf for fear of the rats this was my bed all the time stayed with those people though made more convenient by degrees as began to learn their language and make my wants known this young girl was so handy that after had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her she was able to dress and undress me though never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself she made me seven shirts and some other linen of as fine cloth as could be got which indeed was coarser than sackcloth and these she constantly washed for me with her own hands she was likewise my school mistress to teach me the language when pointed to anything she told me the name of it in her own tongue so that in few days was able to call for whatever had mind to she was very goodnatured and not above forty feet high being little for her age she gave me the name of grildrig which the family took up and afterwards the whole kingdom the word imports what the latins call nanunculus the italians homunceletino and the english mannikin to her chiefly owe my preservation in that country we never parted while was there called her my glumdalclitch or little nurse and should be guilty of great ingratitude if omitted this honorable mention of her care and affection towards me which heartily wish it lay in my power to requite as she deserves instead of being the innocent but unhappy instrument of her disgrace as have too much reason to fear it now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood that my master had found strange animal in the field about the bigness of splacknuck but exactly shaped in every part like human creature which it likewise imitated in all its actions seemed to speak in little language of its own had already learned several words of theirs went erect upon two legs was tame and gentle would come when it was called do whatever it was bid had the finest limbs in the world and complexion fairer than nobleman daughter of three years old another farmer who lived hard by and was particular friend of my master came on visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story was immediately produced and placed upon table where walked as was commanded drew my hanger put it up again made my reverence to my master guest asked him in his own language how he did and told him he was welcome just as my little nurse had instructed me this man who was old and dimsighted put on his spectacles to behold me better at which could not forbear laughing very heartily for his eyes appeared like the full moon shining into chamber at two windows our people who discovered the cause of my mirth bore me company in laughing at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance he had the character of great miser and to my misfortune he well deserved it by the cursed advice he gave my master to show me as sight upon market day in the next town which was half an hour riding about twentytwo miles from our house guessed there was some mischief contriving when observed my master and his friend whispering long together sometimes pointing at me and my fears made me fancy that overheard and understood some of their words but the next morning glumdalclitch my little nurse told me the whole matter which she had cunningly picked out from her mother the poor girl laid me on her bosom and fell weeping with shame and grief she apprehended some mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks who might squeeze me to death or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands she had also observed how modest was in my nature how nicely regarded my honor and what an indignity should conceive it to be exposed for money as public spectacle to the meanest of the people she said her papa and mamma had promised that grildrig should be hers but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year when they pretended to give her lamb and yet as soon as it was fat sold it to butcher for my own part may truly affirm that was less concerned than my nurse had strong hope which never left me that should one day recover my liberty and as to the ignominy of being carried about for monster considered myself to be perfect stranger in the country and that such misfortune could never be charged upon me as reproach if ever should return to england since the king of great britain himself in my condition must have undergone the same distress my master pursuant to the advice of his friend carried me in box the next market day to the neighboring town and took along with him his little daughter my nurse upon pillion behind him the box was close on every side with little door for me to go in and out and few gimlet holes to let in air the girl had been so careful to put the quilt of her baby bed into it for me to lie down on however was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey though it were but of half an hour for the horse went about forty feet at every step and trotted so high that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling of ship in great storm but much more frequent our journey was somewhat further than from london to st albans my master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent and after consulting while with the innkeeper and making some necessary preparations he hired the grultrud or crier to give notice through the town of strange creature to be seen at the sign of the green eagle not so big as splacknuck an animal in that country very finely shaped about six foot long and in every part of the body resembling human creature could speak several words and perform hundred diverting tricks was placed upon table in the largest room of the inn which might be near three hundred feet square my little nurse stood on low stool close to the table to take care of me and direct what should do my master to avoid crowd would suffer only thirty people at time to see me walked about on the table as the girl commanded she asked me questions as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached and answered them as loud as could turned about several times to the company paid my humble respects said they were welcome and used some other speeches had been taught took up thimble filled with liquor which glumdalclitch had given me for cup and drank their health drew out my hanger and flourished it after the manner of fencers in england my nurse gave me part of straw which exercised as pike having learned the art in my youth was that day shown to twelve sets of company and as often forced to go over again with the same fopperies till was half dead with weariness and vexation for those who had seen me made such wonderful reports that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in my master for his own interest would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse and to prevent danger benches were set around the table at such distance as put me out of everybody reach however an unlucky schoolboy aimed hazel nut directly at my head which very narrowly missed me otherwise it came with so much violence that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains for it was almost as large as small pumpion but had the satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten and turned out of the room my master gave public notice that he would show me again the next market day and in the meantime he prepared more convenient vehicle for me which he had reason enough to do for was so tired with my first journey and with entertaining company for eight hours together that could hardly stand upon my legs or speak word it was at least three days before recovered my strength and that might have no rest at home all the neighboring gentlemen from hundred miles around hearing of my fame came to see me at my master own house there could not be fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children for the country is very populous and my master demanded the rate of full room whenever he showed me at home although it were only to single family so that for some time had but little ease every day of the week except wednesday which is their sabbath although were not carried to the town p2ch2 paragraph my master finding how profitable was likely to be resolved to carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom having therefore provided himself with all things necessary for long journey and settled his affairs at home he took leave of his wife and upon the 17th of august 1703 about two months after my arrival we set out for the metropolis situated near the middle of that empire and about three thousand miles distance from our house my master made his daughter glumdalclitch ride behind him she carried me on her lap in box tied about her waist the girl had lined it on all sides with the softest cloth she could get well quilted underneath furnished it with her baby bed provided me with linen and other necessaries and made everything as convenient as she could we had no other company but boy of the house who rode after us with the luggage my master design was to show me in all the towns by the way and to step out of the road for fifty or hundred miles to any village or person of quality house where he might expect custom we made easy journeys of not above seven or eight score miles day for glumdalclitch on purpose to spare me complained she was tired with the trotting of the horse she often took me out of my box at my own desire to give me air and show me the country but always held me fast by leading string we passed over five or six rivers many degrees broader and deeper than the nile or the ganges and there was hardly rivulet so small as the thames at london bridge we were ten weeks in our journey and was shown in eighteen large towns besides many villages and private families on the 26th day of october we arrived at the metropolis called in their language lorbrulgrud or pride of the universe my master took lodging in the principal street of the city not far from the royal palace and put out bills in the usual form containing an exact description of my person and parts he hired large room between three and four hundred feet wide he provided table sixty feet in diameter upon which was to act my part and palisadoed it around three feet from the edge and as many high to prevent my falling over was shown ten times day to the wonder and satisfaction of all people could now speak the language tolerably well and perfectly understood every word that was spoken to me besides had learned their alphabet and could make shift to explain sentence here and there for glumdalclitch had been my instructor while we were at home and at leisure hours during our journey she carried little book in her pocket not much larger than sanson atlas it was common treatise for the use of young girls giving short account of their religion out of this she taught me my letters and interpreted the words p2ch3 chapter iii the frequent labors underwent every day made in few weeks very considerable change in my health the more my master got by me the more unsatiable he grew had quite lost my stomach and was almost reduced to skeleton the farmer observed it and concluding soon must die resolved to make as good hand of me as he could while he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself slardral or gentleman usher came from court commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for the diversion of the queen and her ladies some of the latter had already been to see me and reported strange things of my beauty behavior and good sense her majesty and those who attended her were beyond measure delighted with my demeanor fell on my knees and begged the honor of kissing her imperial foot but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me after was set on table which embraced in both my arms and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip she made me some general questions about my country and my travels which answered as distinctly and in as few words as could she asked whether would be content to live at court bowed down to the board of the table and humbly answered that was my master slave but if were at my own disposal should be proud to devote my life to her majesty service she then asked my master whether he were willing to sell me at good price he who apprehended could not live month was ready enough to part with me and demanded thousand pieces of gold which were ordered him on the spot each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred moidores but allowing for the proportion of all things between that country and europe and the high price of gold among them was hardly so great sum as thousand guineas would be in england then said to the queen since was now her majesty most humble creature and vassal must beg the favor that glumdalclitch who had always tended me with so much care and kindness and understood to do it so well might be admitted into her service and continue to be my nurse and instructor her majesty agreed to my petition and easily got the farmer consent who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court and the poor girl herself was not able to hide her joy my late master withdrew bidding me farewell and saying he had left me in good service to which replied not word only making him slight bow the queen observed my coldness and when the farmer was gone out of the apartment asked me the reason made bold to tell her majesty that owed no other obligation to my late master than his not dashing out the brains of poor harmless creature found by chance in his field which obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he had made in showing me through half the kingdom and the price he had now sold me for that the life had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength that my health was much impaired by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day and that if my master had not thought my life in danger her majesty perhaps would not have got so cheap bargain but as was out of all fear of being ill treated under the protection of so great and good an empress the ornament of nature the darling of the world the delight of her subjects the phoenix of the creation so hoped my late master apprehensions would appear to be groundless for already found my spirits to revive by the influence of her most august presence this was the sum of my speech delivered with great improprieties and hesitation the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar to that people whereof learned some phrases from glumdalclitch while she was carrying me to court the queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking was however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an animal she took me in her own hand and carried me to the king who was then retired to his cabinet his majesty prince of much gravity and austere countenance not well observing my shape at first view asked the queen after cold manner how long it was since she grew fond of splacknuck for such it seems he took me to be as lay upon my breast in her majesty right hand but this princess who has an infinite deal of wit and humor set me gently on my feet upon the scrutore and commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself which did in very few words and glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door and could not endure should be out of her sight being admitted confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father house the king although he be as learned person as any in his dominions and had been educated in the study of philosophy and particularly mathematics yet when he observed my shape exactly and saw me walk erect before began to speak conceived might be piece of clockwork which is in that country arrived to very great perfection contrived by some ingenious artist but when he heard my voice and found what delivered to be regular and rational he could not conceal his astonishment he was by no means satisfied with the relation gave him of the manner came into his kingdom but thought it story concerted between glumdalclitch and her father who had taught me set of words to make me sell at higher price upon this imagination he put several other questions to me and still received rational answers no otherwise defective than by foreign accent and an imperfect knowledge in the language with some rustic phrases which had learned at the farmer house and did not suit the polite style of court p2ch3 paragraph his majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their weekly waiting according to the custom in that country these gentlemen after they had awhile examined my shape with much nicety were of different opinions concerning me they all agreed that could not be produced according to the regular laws of nature because was not framed with capacity of preserving my life either by swiftness or climbing of trees or digging holes in the earth they observed by my teeth which they viewed with great exactness that was carnivorous animal yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me and field mice with some others too nimble they could not imagine how should be able to support myself unless fed upon snails and other insects which they offered by many learned arguments to evince that could not possibly do one of these virtuosi seemed to think that might be an embryo or abortive birth but this opinion was rejected by the other two who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished and that had lived several years as it was manifested from my beard the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through magnifying glass they would not allow me to be dwarf because my littleness was beyond all degrees of comparison for the queen favorite dwarf the smallest ever known in that kingdom was nearly thirty feet high after much debate they concluded unanimously that was only relplum scalcath which is interpreted literally lusus naturae determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of europe whose professors disdaining the old evasion of occult causes whereby the followers of artistotle endeavor in vain to disguise their ignorance have invented this wonderful solution of all difficulties to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge after this decisive conclusion entreated to be heard word or two applied myself to the king and assured his majesty that came from country which abounded with several millions of both sexes and of my own stature where the animals trees and houses were all in proportion and where by consequence might be as able to defend myself and to find sustenance as any of his majesty subjects could do here which took for full answer to those gentlemen arguments to this they only replied with smile of contempt saying that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson the king who had much better understanding dismissing his learned men sent for the farmer who by good fortune was not yet gone out of town having therefore first examined him privately and then confronted him with me and the young girl his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be true he desired the queen to order that particular care should be taken of me and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me because he observed we had great affection for each other convenient apartment was provided for her at court she had sort of governess appointed to take care of her education maid to dress her and two other servants for menial offices but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself the queen commanded her own cabinet maker to contrive box that might serve me for bedchamber after the model that glumdalclitch and should agree upon this man was most ingenious artist and according to my directions in three weeks finished for me wooden chamber of sixteen feet square and twelve high with sash windows door and two closets like london bedchamber the board that made the ceiling was to be lifted up and down by two hinges to put in bed ready furnished by her majesty upholsterer which glumdalclitch took out every day to air made it with her own hands and letting it down at night locked up the roof over me nice workman who was famous for little curiosities undertook to make me two chairs with backs and frames of substance not unlike ivory and two tables with cabinet to put my things in the room was quilted on all sides as well as the floor and the ceiling to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who carried me and to break the force of jolt when went in coach desired lock for my door to prevent rats and mice from coming in the smith after several attempts made the smallest that ever was seen among them for have known larger at the gate of gentleman house in england made shift to keep the key in pocket of my own fearing glumdalclitch might lose it the queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be gotten to make me clothes not much thicker than an english blanket very cumbersome till was accustomed to them they were after the fashion of the kingdom partly resembling the persian and partly the chinese and are very grave and decent habit the queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine without me had table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate just at her left elbow and chair to sit on glumdalclitch stood upon stool on the floor near my table to assist and take care of me had an entire set of silver dishes and plates and other necessaries which in proportion to those of the queen were not much bigger than what have seen of the same kind in london toy shop for the furniture of babyhouse these my little nurse kept in her pocket in silver box and gave me at meals as wanted them always cleaning them herself no person dined with the queen but the two princesses royal the elder sixteen years old and the younger at that time thirteen and month her majesty used to put bit of meat upon one of my dishes out of which carved for myself and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature for the queen who had indeed but weak stomach took up at one mouthful as much as dozen english farmers could eat at meal which to me was for some time very nauseous sight she would crunch the wing of lark bones and all between her teeth although it were nine times as large as that of full grown turkey and put bit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelvepenny loaves she drank out of golden cup above hogshead at draught her knives were twice as long as scythe set straight upon the handle the spoons forks and other instruments were all in the same proportion remember when glumdalclitch carried me out of curiosity to see some of the tables at court where ten or dozen of these enormous knives and forks were lifted up together thought had never till then beheld so terrible sight it is the custom that every wednesday which as have before observed was their sabbath the king and queen with the royal issue of both sexes dine together in the apartment of his majesty to whom was now become great favorite and at these times my little chair and table were placed at his left hand before one of the salt cellars this prince took pleasure in conversing with me inquiring into the manners religion laws government and learning of europe wherein gave him the best account was able his apprehension was so clear and his judgment so exact that he made very wise reflections and observations upon all said but confess that after had been little too copious in talking of my own beloved country of our trade and wars by sea and land of our schisms in religion and parties in the state the prejudices of his education prevailed so far that he could not forbear taking me up in his right hand and stroking me gently with the other after an hearty fit of laughing asked me whether were whig or tory then turning to his first minister who waited behind him with white staff near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign he observed how contemptible thing was human grandeur which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as and yet said he dare engage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honor they contrive little nests and burrows that they call houses and cities they make figure in dress and equipage they love they fight they dispute they cheat they betray and thus he continued on while my color came and went several times with indignation to hear our noble country the mistress of arts and arms the scourge of france the arbitress of europe the seat of virtue piety honor and truth the pride and envy of the world contemptuously treated but as was not in condition to resent injuries so upon mature thoughts began to doubt whether were injured or not for after having been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this people and observed every object upon which cast my eyes to be of proportionable magnitude the horror had first conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off that if had then beheld company of english lords and ladies in their finery and best day clothes acting their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting and bowing and prating to say the truth should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me neither indeed could forbear smiling at myself when the queen used to place me upon her hand towards looking glass by which both our persons appeared before me in full view together and there could be nothing more ridiculous than the comparison so that really began to imagine myself dwindled many degrees below my usual size p2ch3 paragraph 10 nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen dwarf who being of the lowest stature that was ever that country for verily think he was not thirty feet high became insolent at seeing creature so much beneath him that he would always affect to swagger and look big as he passed by me in the queen antechamber while was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court and he seldom failed of smart word or two upon my littleness against which could only revenge myself by calling him brother challenging him to wrestle and such repartees as are usual in the mouths of court pages one day at dinner this malicious little cub was so nettled with something had said to him that raising himself upon the frame of her majesty chair he took me up by the middle as was sitting down not thinking any harm and let me drop into large silver bowl of cream and then ran away as fast as he could fell over head and ears and if had not been good swimmer it might have gone very hard with me for glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the room and the queen was in such fright that she wanted presence of mind to assist me but my little nurse ran to my relief and took me out after had swallowed above quart of cream was put to bed however received no other damage than the loss of suit of clothes which was utterly spoiled the dwarf was soundly whipped and as farther punishment forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown me neither was he ever restored to favor for soon after the queen bestowed him to lady of high quality so that saw him no more to my very great satisfaction for could not tell to what extremity such malicious urchin might have carried his resentment he had before served me scurvy trick which set the queen laughing although at the same time she was heartily vexed and would have immediately cashiered him if had not been so generous as to intercede her majesty had taken marrow bone upon her plate and after knocking out the marrow placed the bone again in the dish erect as it stood before the dwarf watching his opportunity while glumdalclitch was gone to the sideboard mounted upon the stool she stood on to take care of me at meals took me up in both hands and squeezing my legs together wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist where stuck for some time and made very ridiculous figure believe it was near minute before any one knew what was become of me for thought it below me to cry out but as princes seldom get their meat hot my legs were not scalded only my stockings and breeches in sad condition the dwarf at my entreaty had no other punishment than sound whipping was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness and she used to ask me whether the people of ray country were as great cowards as myself the occasion was this the kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer and these odious insects each of them as big as dunstable lark hardly gave me any rest while sat at dinner with their continual humming and buzzing about my ears they would sometimes alight upon my victuals and leave their loathsome excrement or spawn behind which to me was very visible though not to the natives of that country whose large optics were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller objects sometimes they would fix upon my nose or forehead where they stung me to the quick smelling very offensively and could easily trace that viscous matter which our naturalists tell us enables those creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon ceiling had much ado to defend myself against these detestable animals and could not forbear starting when they came on my face it was the common practice of the dwarf to catch number of these insects in his hand as schoolboys do among us and let them out suddenly under my nose on purpose to frighten me and divert the queen my remedy was to cut them in pieces with my knife as they flew in the air wherein my dexterity was much admired remember one morning when glumdalclitch had set me in my box upon window as she usually did in fair days to give me air for dared not venture to let the box be hung on nail out of the window as we do with cages in england after had lifted up one of my sashes and sat down at my table to eat piece of sweet cake for my breakfast above twenty wasps allured by the smell came flying into the room humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes some of them seized my cake and carried it piecemeal away others flew about my head and face confounding me with the noise and putting me in the utmost terror of their stings however had the courage to rise and draw my hanger and attack them in the air dispatched four of them but the rest got away and presently shut my window these insects were as large as partridges took out their stings found them an inch and half long and as sharp as needles carefully preserved them all and having since shown them with some other curiosities in several parts of europe upon my return to england gave three of them to gresham college and kept the fourth for myself p2ch4 chapter iv now intend to give the reader short description of this country as far as traveled in it which was not above two thousand miles round lorbrulgrud the metropolis for the queen whom always attended never went further when she accompanied the king in his progresses and there stayed until his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers the whole extent of this prince dominions reaches about six thousand miles in length and from three to five in breadth from whence can not but conclude that our geographers of europe are in great error by supposing nothing but sea between japan and california for it was ever my opinion that there must be balance of earth to counterpoise the great continent of tartary and therefore they ought to correct their maps and charts by joining this vast tract of land to the northwest parts of america wherein shall be ready to lend them my assistance the kingdom is peninsula terminated to the northeast by ridge of mountains thirty miles high which are altogether impassable by reason of the volcanoes upon the tops neither do the most learned know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains or whether they be inhabited at all on the three other sides it is bounded by the ocean there is not one seaport in the whole kingdom and those parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed rocks and the sea generally so rough that there is no venturing with the smallest of their boats so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world but the large rivers are full of vessels and abound with excellent fish for they seldom get any from the sea because the sea fish are of the same size with those in europe and consequently not worth catching whereby it is manifest that nature in the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary bulk is wholly confined to this continent of which leave the reasons to be determined by philosophers however now and then they take whale that happens to be dashed against the rocks which the common people feed on heartily these whales have known so large that man could hardly carry one upon his shoulders and sometimes for curiosity they are brought in hampers to lorbrulgrud saw one of them in dish at the king table which passed for rarity but did not observe he was fond of it for think indeed the bigness disgusted him although have seen one somewhat larger in greenland the country is well inhabited for it contains fiftyone cities near hundred walled towns and great number of villages to satisfy my curious reader it may be sufficient to describe lorbrulgrud this city stands upon almost two equal parts on each side the river that passes through it contains above eighty thousand houses and about six hundred thousand inhabitants it is in length three glonglungs which make about fiftyfour english miles and two and half in breadth as measured it myself in the royal map made by the king order which was laid on the ground on purpose for me and extended hundred feet paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot and computing by the scale measured it pretty exactly the king palace is no regular edifice but heap of building about seven miles around the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty feet high and broad and long proportion coach was allowed to glumdalclitch and me wherein her governess frequently took her out to see the town or go among the shops and was always of the party carried in my box although the girl at my own desire would often take me out and hold me in her hand that might more conveniently view the houses and the people as we passed along the streets reckoned our coach to be about square of westminster hall but not altogether so high however can not be very exact one day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops where the beggars watching their opportunity crowded to the sides of the coach and gave me the most horrible spectacles that ever an english eye beheld there was woman with cancer in her breast swelled to monstrous size full of holes in two or three of which could have easily crept and covered my whole body there was fellow with wen in his neck larger than five woolpacks and another with couple of wooden legs each about twenty feet high but the most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on their clothes could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye much better than those of an european louse through microscope and their snouts with which they rooted like swine they were the first had ever beheld and should have been curious enough to dissect one of them if had proper instruments which unluckily left behind me in the shop although indeed the sight was so nauseous that it perfectly turned my stomach besides the large box in which was usually carried the queen ordered smaller one to be made for me of about twelve feet square and ten high for the convenience of traveling because the other was somewhat too large for glumdalclitch lap and cumbersome in the coach it was made by the same artist whom directed in the whole contrivance this traveling closet was an exact square with window in the middle of three of the squares and each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside to prevent accidents in long journeys on the fourth side which had no window two strong staples were fixed through which the person that carried me when had mind to be on horseback put in leathern belt and buckled it about his waist this was always the office of some grave trusty servant in whom could confide whether attended the king and queen in their progresses or were disposed to see the gardens or pay visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order for soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers suppose more upon account of their majesties favor than any merit of my own in journeys when was weary of the coach servant on horseback would buckle my box and place it on cushion before him and there had full prospect of the country on three sides from my three windows had in this closet field bed and hung from the ceiling two chairs and table neatly screwed to the floor to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach and having been long used to sea voyages those motions although sometimes very violent did not much discompose me p2ch4 paragraph whenever had mind to see the town it was always in my traveling closet which glumdalclitch held in her lap in kind of open sedan after the fashion of the country borne by four men and attended by two others in the queen livery the people who had often heard of me were very curious to crowd about the sedan and the girl was complaisant enough to make the bearers stop and to take me in her hand that might be more conveniently seen was very desirous to see the chief temple and particularly the tower belonging to it which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither but may truly say came back disappointed for height is not above three thousand feet reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top which allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in europe is no great matter for admiration nor at all equal in proportion if rightly remember to salisbury steeple but not to detract from nation to which during my life shall acknowledge myself extremely obliged it must be allowed that whatever this famous tower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength for the walls are near hundred feet thick built of hewn stone whereof each is about forty feet square and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors cut in marble larger than the life placed in their several niches measured little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues and lay unperceived among some rubbish and found it exactly four feet and an inch in length glumdalclitch wrapped it up in handkerchief and carried it home in her pocket to keep among other trinkets of which the girl was very fond as children at her age usually are the king kitchen is indeed noble building vaulted at top and about six hundred feet high the great oven is not so wide by ten yards as the cupola at st paul for measured the latter on purpose after my return but if should describe the kitchen grate the prodigious pots and kettles the joints of meat turning on the spits with many other particulars perhaps should be hardly believed at least severe critic would be apt to think enlarged little as travelers are often suspected to do to avoid which censure fear have run too much into the other extreme and that if this treatise should happen to be translated into the language of brobdingnag which is the general name of that kingdom and transmitted thither the king and his people would have reason to complain that had done them an injury by false and diminutive representation his majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables they are generally from fiftyfour to sixty feet high but when he goes abroad on solemn days he is attended for state by militia guard of five hundred horse which indeed thought was the most splendid sight that could be ever beheld till saw part of his army in battalia whereof shall find another occasion to speak p2ch5 chapter should have lived happy enough in that country if my littleness had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents some of which shall venture to relate glumdalclitch often carried me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box and would sometimes take me out of it and hold me in her hand or set me down to walk remember before the dwarf left the queen he followed us one day into those gardens and my nurse having set me down he and being close together near some dwarf apple trees must needs show my wit by silly allusion between him and the trees which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours whereupon the malicious rogue watching his opportunity when was walking under one of them shook it directly over my head by which dozen apples each of them near as large as bristol barrel came tumbling about my ears one of them hit me on the back as chanced to stoop and knocked me down flat on my face but received no other hurt and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire because had given the provocation another day glumdalclitch left me on smooth grass plot to divert myself while she walked at some distance with her governess in the meantime there suddenly fell such violent shower of hail that was immediately by the force of it struck to the ground and when was down the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body as if had been pelted with tennis balls however made shift to creep on all fours and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the lee side of border of lemon thyme but so bruised from head to foot that could not go abroad in ten days neither is this at all to be wondered at because nature in that country observing the same proportion through all her operations hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as large as one in europe which can assert upon experience having been so curious to weigh and measure them but more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden when my little nurse believing she had put me in secure place which often entreated her to do that might enjoy my own thoughts and having left my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it went to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance while she was absent and out of hearing small white spaniel belonging to one of the chief gardeners having got by accident into the garden happened to range near the place where lay the dog following the scent came directly up and taking me in his mouth ran straight to his master wagging his tail and set me gently on the ground by good fortune he had been so well taught that was carried between his teeth without the least hurt or even tearing my clothes but the poor gardener who knew me well and had great kindness for me was in terrible fright he gently took me up in both his hands and asked me how did but was so amazed and out of breath that could not speak word in few minutes came to myself and he carried me safe to my little nurse who by this time had returned to the place where she left me and was in cruel agonies when did not appear nor answer when she called she severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog but the thing was hushed up and never known at court for the girl was afraid of the queen anger and truly as to myself thought it would not be for my reputation that such story should go about this accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the future out of her sight had been long afraid of this resolution and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky adventures that happened in those times when was left by myself once kite hovering over the garden made swoop at me and if had not resolutely drawn my hanger and run under thick espalier he would have certainly carried me away in his talons another time walking to the top of fresh molehill fell to my neck in the hole through which that animal had cast up the earth and coined some lie not worth remembering to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes likewise broke my right shin against the shell of snail which happened to stumble over as was walking alone and thinking on poor england can not tell whether were more pleased or mortified to observe in those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all afraid of me but would hop about within yard distance looking for worms and other food with as much indifference and security as if no creature at all were near them remember thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand with his bill piece of cake that glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast when attempted to catch any of these birds they would boldly turn against me endeavoring to pick my fingers which dared not venture within their reach and then they would hop back unconcerned to hunt for worms or snails as they did before but one day took thick cudgel and threw it with all my strength so luckily at linnet that knocked him down and seizing him by the neck with both my hands ran with him in triumph to my nurse however the bird who had only been stunned recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body though held him at arm length and was out of the reach of his claws that was twenty times thinking to let him go but was soon relieved by one of our servants who wrung off the bird neck and had him next day for dinner by the queen command this as near as can remember to be somewhat larger than an english swan p2ch5 paragraph the maids of honor often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments and desired she would bring me along with her on purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me they would often strip me naked from top to toe and lay me at full length in their bosoms wherewith was much disgusted because to say the truth very offensive smell came from their skins which do not mention or intend to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies for whom have all manner of respect but conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness and that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers or to each other than people of the same quality are with us in england and after all found their natural smell was much more supportable than when they used perfumes under which immediately swooned away can not forget that an intimate friend of mine in lilliput took the freedom in warm day when had used good deal of exercise to complain of strong smell about me although am as little faulty that way as most of my sex but suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me as mine was to that of this people upon this point can not forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress and glumdalclitch my nurse whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady in england that which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honor when my nurse carried me to visit them was to see them use me without any manner of ceremony like creature who had no sort of consequence for they would strip themselves to the skin and put on their smocks in my presence while was placed on their toilet directly before their naked bodies which am sure to me was very far from being tempting sight or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust their skins appeared so coarse and uneven so variously colored when saw them near with mole here and there as broad as trencher and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads to say nothing further concerning the rest of their persons neither did they at all scruple while was by to discharge what they had drunk to the quantity of at least two hogsheads in vessel that held above three tons the handsomest among these maids of honor pleasant frolicsome girl of sixteen would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples with many other tricks wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular but was so much displeased that entreated glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more one day young gentleman who was nephew to my nurse governess came and pressed them both to see an execution it was of man who had murdered one of that gentleman intimate acquaintance glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company very much against her inclination for she was naturally tenderhearted and as for myself although abhorred such kind of spectacles yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that thought must be extraordinary the malefactor was fixed in chair upon scaffold erected for the purpose and his head cut off at blow with sword of about forty foot long the veins and arteries spouted up such prodigious quantity of blood and so high in the air that the great jet deau at versailles was not equal for the time it lasted and the head when it fell on the scaffold floor gave such bounce as made me start although were at least half an english mile distant the queen who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages and took all occasions to divert me when was melancholy asked me whether understood how to handle sail or an oar and whether little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health answered that understood both very well for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship yet upon pinch was forced to work like common mariner but could not see how this could be done in their country where the smallest wherry was equal to firstrate man of war among us and such boat as could manage would never live in any of their rivers her majesty said if would contrive boat her own joiner should make it and she would provide place for me to sail in the fellow was an ingenious workman and by my instructions in ten days finished pleasure boat with all its tackling able conveniently to hold eight europeans when it was finished the queen was so delighted that she ran with it in her lap to the king who ordered it to be put in cistern full of water with me in it by way of trial where could not manage my two sculls or little oars for want of room but the queen had before contrived another project she ordered the joiner to make wooden trough of three hundred feet long fifty broad and eight deep which being well pitched to prevent leaking was placed on the floor along the wall in an outer room of the palace it had cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour here often used to row for my own diversion as well as that of the queen and her ladies who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and agility sometimes would put up my sail and then my business was only to steer while the ladies gave me gale with their fans and when they were weary some of the pages would blow my sail forward with their breath while showed my art steering starboard or larboard as pleased when had done glumdalclitch always carried my boat into her closet and hung it on nail to dry in this exercise once met an accident which had like to have cost me my life for one of the pages having put my boat into the trough the governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up to place me in the boat but happened to slip through her fingers and should have infallibly fallen down forty feet upon the floor if by the luckiest chance in the world had not been stopped by corkingpin that stuck in the good gentlewoman stomacher the head of the pin passed between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches and thus was held by the middle in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my relief p2ch5 paragraph 10 another time one of the servants whose office it was to fill my trough every third day with fresh water was so careless to let huge frog not perceiving it slip out of his pail the frog lay concealed till was put into my boat but then seeking resting place climbed up and made it lean so much on one side that was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other to prevent overturning when the frog got in it hopped at once half the length of the boat and then over my head backwards and forwards daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived however desired glumdaclitch to let me deal with it alone banged it good while with one of my sculls and at last forced it to leap out of the boat but the greatest danger ever underwent in that kingdom was from monkey who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet while she went somewhere upon business or visit the weather being very warm the closet window was left open as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box in which usually lived because of its largeness and conveniency as sat quietly meditating at my table heard something bounce in at the closet window and skip about from one side to the other whereat although was much alarmed yet ventured to look out but stirred not from my seat and then saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down till at last he came to my box which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity peeping in at the door and every window retreated to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkey looking in at every side put me into such fright that wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed as might easily have done after some time spent in peeping grinning and chattering he at last espied me and reaching one of his paws in at the door as cat does when she plays with mouse although often shifted place to avoid him he at length seized the lappet of my coat which being made of that country cloth was very thick and strong and dragged me out he took me up in his right forefoot and held me as nurse does child she is going to suckle just as have seen the same sort of creature do with kitten in europe and when offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard that thought it more prudent to submit have good to believe that he took me for young one of his own species by his often stroking my face very gently with his other paw in these diversions he was interrupted by noise at the closet door as if somebody were opening it whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come in and thence upon the leads and gutters walking upon three legs and holding me in the fourth till he clambered up to roof that was next to ours heard glumdalclitch give shriek at the moment he was carrying me out the poor girl was almost distracted that quarter of the palace was all in an uproar the servants ran for ladders the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court sitting upon the ridge of building holding me like baby in one of his forepaws and feeding me with the other by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his chaps and patting me when would not eat whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing neither do think they justly ought to be blamed for without question the sight was ridiculous enough to everybody but myself some of the people threw up stones hoping to drive the monkey down but this was strictly forbidden or else very probably my brains had been dashed out the ladders were now applied and mounted by several men which the monkey observing and finding himself almost encompassed not being able to make speed enough with his three legs let me drop on ridge tile and made his escape here sat for some time three hundred yards from the ground expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind or to fall by my own giddiness and come tumbling over and over from the ridge to the eaves but an honest lad one of my nurse footmen climbed up and putting me into his breeches pocket brought me down safe was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with small needle and then fell to vomiting which gave me great relief yet was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious animal that was forced to keep my bed fortnight the king queen and all the court sent every day to inquire after my health and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness the monkey was killed and an order made that no such animal should be kept about the palace when attended the king after my recovery to return him thanks for his favors he was pleased to rally me good deal upon this adventure he asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while lay in the monkey paw how liked the victuals he gave me his manner of feeding and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach he desired to know what would have done upon such an occasion my own country told his majesty that in europe we had no monkeys except such as were brought for curiosities from other places and so small that could deal with dozen of them together if they presumed to attack me and as for that monstrous animal with whom was so lately engaged it was indeed as large as an elephant if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger looking fiercely and clapping my hand upon the hilt as spoke when he poked his paw into my chamber perhaps should have given him such wound as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in this delivered in firm tone like person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question however my speech produced nothing else besides loud laughter which all the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make them contain this made me reflect how vain an attempt it is for man to endeavor doing himself honor among those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him and yet have seen the moral of my own behavior very frequent in england since my return where little contemptible varlet without the least title to birth person wit or common sense shall presume to look with importance and put himself upon foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom p2ch5 paragraph 15 was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story and glumdalclitch although she loved me to excess yet was arch enough to inform the queen whenever committed any folly that she thought would be diverting to her majesty the girl who had been out of order was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour distance or thirty miles from town they alighted out of the coach near small footpath in field and glumdalclitch setting down my traveling box went out of it to walk there was cow dung in the path and must needs try my activity by attempting to leap over it took run but unfortunately jumped short and found myself just in the middle up to my knees waded through with some difficulty and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief for was filthily bemired and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned home where the queen was soon informed of what had passed and the footmen spread it about the court so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense p2ch6 chapter vi used to attend the king levee once or twice week and had often seen him under the barber hand which indeed was at first very terrible to behold for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe his majesty according to the custom of the country was only shaved twice week once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds or lather out of which picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair then took piece of fine wood and cut it like the back of comb making several holes in it at equal distance with as small needle as could get from glumdalclitch fixed in the stumps so artificially scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points that made very tolerable comb which was seasonable supply my own being so much broken in the teeth that it was almost useless neither did know any artist in that country so nice and exact as would undertake to make me another and this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein spent many of my leisure hours desired the queen woman to save for me the combings of her majesty hair whereof in time got good quantity and consulting with my friend the cabinetmaker who had received general orders to do little jobs for me directed him to make two chair frames no larger than those had in my box and then to bore little holes with fine awl round those parts where designed the backs and seats through these holes wove the strongest hairs could pick out just after the manner of cane chairs in england when they were finished made present of them to her majesty who kept them in her cabinet and used to show them for curiosities as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them the queen would have had me sit upon one of these chairs but absolutely refused to obey her protesting would rather die thousand deaths than place dishonorable part of my body on those precious hairs that once adorned her majesty head of these hairs as had always mechanical genius likewise made neat little purse about five feet long with her majesty name deciphered in gold letters which gave to glumdalclitch by the queen consent to say the truth it was more for show than use being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coins and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that girls are fond of the king who delighted in music had frequent concerts at court to which was sometimes carried and set in my box on table to hear them but the noise was so great that could hardly distinguish the tunes am confident that all the drums and trumpets of royal army beating and sounding together just at your ears could not equal it my practice was to have my box removed from the places where the performers sat as far as could then to shut the doors and windows of it and draw the window curtains after which found their music not disagreeable had learned in my youth to play little upon the spinet glumdaclitch kept one in her chamber and master attended twice week to teach her call it spinet because it somewhat resembled that instrument and was played upon in the same manner fancy came into my head that would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon this instrument but this appeared extremely difficult for the spinet was near sixty feet long each key being almost foot wide so that with my arms extended could not reach to above five keys and to press them down required good smart stroke with my fist which would be too great labor and to no purpose the method contrived was this prepared two round sticks about the bigness of common cudgels they were thicker at one end than the other and covered the thicker ends with piece of mouse skin that by rapping on them might neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound before the spinet bench was placed about four feet below the keys and was put upon the bench ran sideling upon it that way and this as fast as could banging the proper keys with my two sticks and made shift to play jig to the great satisfaction of both their majesties but it was the most violent exercise ever underwent and yet could not strike above sixteen keys nor consequently play the bass and treble together as other artists do which was great disadvantage to my performance the king who as before observed was prince of excellent understanding would frequently order that should be brought in my box and set upon the table in his closet he would then command me to bring one of my chairs out of the box and sit down within three yards distance upon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to level with his face in this manner had several conversations with him one day took the freedom to tell his majesty that the contempt he discovered towards europe and the rest of the world did not seem answerable to those excellent qualities of the mind he was master of that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body on the contrary we observed in our country that the tallest persons were usually least provided with it that among other animals bees and ants had the reputation of more industry art and sagacity than many of the larger kinds and that as inconsiderable as he took me to be hoped might live to do his majesty some signal service the king heard me with attention and began to conceive much better opinion of me than he had ever before he desired would give him as exact an account of the government of england as possibly could because as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs for so he conjectured of other monarchs by my former discourses he should be glad to hear of anything that might deserve imitation p2ch6 paragraph imagine with thyself courteous reader how often then wished for the tongue of demosthenes or cicero that might have enabled me to celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in style equal to its merits and felicity began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominions consisted of two islands which composed three mighty kingdoms under one sovereign beside our plantations in america dwelt long upon the fertility of our soil and the temperature of our climate then spoke at large upon the constitution of an english parliament partly made up of an illustrious body called the house of peers persons of the noblest blood and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies described that extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms to qualify them for being counselors born to the king and kingdom to have share in the legislature to be members of the highest court of judicature from whence there could be no appeal and to be champions always ready for the defense of their prince and country by their valor conduct and fidelity that these were the ornament and bulwark of the kingdom worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors whose honor had been the reward of their virtue from which their posterity were never once known to degenerate to these we joined several holy persons as part of that assembly under the title of bishops whose peculiar business it is to take care of religion and of those who instruct the people therein these were searched and sought out through the whole nation by the prince and his wisest counselors among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their lives and the depth of their erudition who were indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people that the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the house of commons who were all principal gentlemen freely picked and culled out by the people themselves for their great abilities and love of their country to represent the wisdom of the whole nation and these two bodies make up the most august assembly in europe to whom in conjunction with the prince the whole legislature is committed then descended to the courts of justice over which the judges those venerable sages and interpreters of the law presided for determining the disputed rights and properties of men as well as for the punishment of vice and protection of innocence mentioned the prudent management of our treasury the valor and achievements of our forces by sea and land computed the number of our people by reckoning how many millions there might be of each religious sect or political party among us did not omit even our sports and pastimes or any other particular which thought might redound to the honor of my country and finished all with brief historical account of affairs and events in england for about hundred years past this conversation was not ended under five audiences each of several hours and the king heard the whole with great attention frequently taking notes of what spoke as well as memorandums of several questions he intended to ask me p2ch6 paragraph 10 when had put an end to these long discourses his majesty in sixth audience consulting his notes proposed many doubts queries and objections upon every article he asked what methods were used to cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility and in what kind of business they commonly spent the first and teachable part of their lives what course was taken to supply that assembly when any noble family became extinct what qualifications were in those who were to be created new lords whether the humor of the prince sum of money to court lady or prime minister or design of strengthening party opposite to the public interest ever happened to be motives in those advancements what share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of their country and how they came by it so as to enable them to decide the properties of their fellowsubjects in the last resort whether they were always so free from avarice partialities or want that bribe or some other sinister view could have no place among them whether those holy lords spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in religious matters and the sanctity of their lives had never been compliers with the times while they were common priests or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman whose opinions they continued servilely to follow after they were admitted into that assembly he then desired to know what arts were practiced in electing those whom commoners whether stranger with strong purse might not influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord or the most considerable gentleman in the neighborhood how it came to pass that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly which allowed to be great trouble and expense often to the ruin of their families without any salary or pension because this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit that his majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere and he desired to know whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the public good to the designs of weak and vicious prince in conjunction with corrupted ministry he multiplied his questions and sifted me thoroughly upon every part of this head proposing numberless inquiries and objections which think it not prudent or convenient to repeat upon what said in relation to our courts of justice his majesty desired to be satisfied in several points and this was the better able to do having been formerly almost ruined by long suit in chancery which was decreed for me with costs he asked what time was usually spent in determining between right and wrong and what degree of expense whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust vexatious or oppressive whether party in religion or politics were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity or only in provincial national and other local customs whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws which they assumed the liberty of interpreting and glossing upon at their pleasure whether they had ever at different times pleaded for and against the same cause and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions whether they were rich or poor corporation whether they received any pecuniary reward for pleading or delivering their opinions and particularly whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate he fell next upon the management of our treasury and said he thought my memory had failed me because computed our taxes at about five or six millions year and when came to mention the issues he found they sometimes amounted to more than double for the notes he had taken were very particular in this point because he hoped as he told me that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him and he could not be deceived in his calculations but if what told him were true he was still at loss how kingdom could run out of its estate like private person he asked me who were our creditors and where we should find money to pay them he wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and extensive wars that certainly we must be quarrelsome people or live among very bad neighbors and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings he asked what business we had out of our own islands unless upon the score of trade or treaty or to defend the coasts with our fleet about all he was amazed to hear me talk of mercenary standing army in the midst of peace and among free people he said if we were governed by our own consent in the persons of our representatives he could not imagine of whom we were afraid or against whom we were to fight and would hear my opinion whether private man house might not better be defended by himself his children and family than by half dozen rascals picked up at venture in the streets for small wages who might get hundred times more by cutting their throats he laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic as he was pleased to call it in reckoning the numbers of our people by computation drawn from the several sects among us in religion and politics he said he knew no reason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public should be obliged to change or should not be obliged to conceal them and as it was tyranny in any government to require the first so it was weakness not to enforce the second for man may be allowed to keep poisons in his closet but not to vend them about for cordials p2ch6 paragraph 15 he observed that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry had mentioned gaming he desired to know at what age this entertainment was usually taken up and when it was laid down how much of their time it employed whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes whether mean vicious people by their dexterity in that art might not arrive at great riches and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence as well as habituate them to vile companions wholly take them from the improvement of their minds and force them by the losses they have received to learn and practice that infamous dexterity upon others he was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our affairs during the last century protesting it was only heap of conspiracies rebellions murders massacres revolutions banishments the very worst effects that avarice faction hypocrisy perfidiousness cruelty rage madness hatred envy lust malice or ambition could produce his majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate the sum of all had spoken compared the questions he made with the answers had given then taking me into his hands and stroking me gently delivered himself in these words which shall never forget nor the manner he spoke them in my little friend grildrig you have made most admirable panegyric upon your country you have clearly proved that ignorance idleness and vice may be sometimes the only ingredients for qualifying legislator that laws are best explained interpreted and applied by those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting confounding and eluding them observe among you some lines of an institution which in its original might have been tolerable but these half erased and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions it does not appear from all you have said how any one virtue is required towards the procurement of any one station among you much less that men are ennobled on account of their virtue that priests are advanced for their piety or learning soldiers for their conduct or valor judges for their integrity senators for the love of their country or counsellors for their wisdom as for yourself continued the king who have spent the greatest part of your life in traveling am well disposed to hope you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country but by what have gathered from your own relation and the answers have with much pains wringed and extorted from you can not but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth p2ch7 chapter vii nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from concealing this part of my story it was in vain to discover my resentments which were always turned into ridicule and was forced to rest with patience while my noble and most beloved country was so injuriously treated am heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be that such an occasion was given but this prince happened to be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular that it could not consist either with gratitude or good manners to refuse giving him what satisfaction was able yet thus much may be allowed to say in my own vindication that artfully eluded many of his questions and gave to every point more favorable turn by many degrees than the strictness of truth would allow for have always borne that laudable partiality to my own country which dionysius halicarnassensis with so much justice recommends to historian would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother and place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light this was my sincere endeavor in those many discourses had with that mighty monarch although it unfortunately failed of success but great allowances should be given to king who lives wholly secluded from the rest of the world and must therefore be altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices and certain narrowness of thinking from which we and the politer countries of europe are wholly exempted and it would be hard indeed if so remote prince notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as standard for all mankind to confirm what have now said and further to show the miserable effects of confined education shall here insert passage which will hardly obtain belief in hopes to ingratiate myself farther into his majesty favor told him of an invention discovered between three and four hundred years ago to make certain powder into heap of which the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in moment although it were as big as mountain and make it all fly up in the air together with noise and agitation greater than thunder that proper quantity of this powder rammed into hollow tube of brass or iron according to its bigness would drive ball of iron or lead with such violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force the largest balls thus discharged would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once but batter the strongest walls to the ground sink down ships with thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea and when linked together by chain would cut through masts and rigging divide hundreds of bodies in the middle and lay all waste before them that we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron and discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging which would rip up the pavements tear the houses to pieces burst and throw splinters on every side dashing out the brains of all who came near that knew the ingredients very well which were cheap and common understood the manner of compounding them and could direct his workmen how to make those tubes of size proportionable to all other things in his majesty kingdom and the largest need not be above hundred feet long twenty or thirty of which tubes charged with the proper quantity of powder and balls would batter down the walls of the strongest town in his dominions in few hours or destroy the whole metropolis if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute commands this humbly offered to his majesty as small tribute of acknowledgment in return of so many marks that had received of his royal favor and protection the king was struck with horror at the description had given of those terrible engines and the proposal had made he was amazed how so impotent and grovelling an insect as these were his expressions could entertain such inhuman ideas and in so familiar manner as to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines whereof he said some evil genius enemy to mankind must have been the first contriver as for himself he protested that although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature yet he would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such secret which he commanded me as valued my life never to mention any more strange effect of narrow principles and short views that prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration love and esteem of strong parts great wisdom and profound learning endued with admirable talents for government and almost adored by his subjects should from nice unnecessary scruple whereof in europe we can have no conception let slip an opportunity to put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives the liberties and the fortunes of his people neither do say this with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that excellent king whose character am sensible will on this account be very much lessened in the opinion of an english reader but take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance they not having hitherto reduced politics into science as the more acute wits of europe have done for remember very well in discourse one day with the king when happened to say there were several thousand books among us written upon the art of government it gave him directly contrary to my intention very mean opinion of our understandings he professed both to abominate and despise all mystery refinement and intrigue either in prince or minister he could not tell what meant secrets of state where an enemy or some rival nation were not in the case he confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow bounds to common sense and reason to justice and lenity to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes with some other obvious topics which are not worth considering and he gave it for his opinion that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve better of mankind and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together p2ch7 paragraph the learning of this people is very defective consisting only in morality history poetry and mathematics wherein they must be allowed to excel but the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful in life to the improvement of agriculture and all mechanical arts so that among us it would be little esteemed and as to ideas entities abstractions and transcendentals could never drive the least conception into their heads no law of that country must exceed in words the number of letters in their alphabet which consists only of twentytwo but indeed few of them extend even to that length they are expressed in the most plain and simple terms wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover above one interpretation and to write comment upon any law is capital crime as to the decision of civil causes or proceedings against criminals their precedents are so few that they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either they have had the art of printing as well as the chinese time out of mind but their libraries are not very large for that of the king which is reckoned the biggest does not amount to above thousand volumes placed in gallery twelve hundred feet long from which had liberty to borrow what books pleased the queen joiner had contrived in one of glumdalclitch rooms kind of wooden machine twentyfive feet high formed like standing ladder the steps were each fifty feet long it was indeed moveable pair of stairs the lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber the book had mind to read was put up leaning against the wall first mounted to the upper step of the ladder and turning my face towards the book began at the top of the page and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten yards according to the length of the lines till had gotten little below the level of my eyes and then descending gradually till came to the bottom after which mounted again and began the other page in the same manner and so turned over the leaf which could easily do with both my hands for it was as thick and stiff as pasteboard and in the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long their style is clear masculine and smooth but not florid for they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words or using various expressions have perused many of their books especially those in history and morality among the rest was much diverted with little old treatise which always lay in glumdalclitch bed chamber and belonged to her governess grave elderly gentlewoman who dealt in writings of morality and devotion the book treats of the weakness of human kind and is in little esteem except among the women and the vulgar however was curious to see what an author of that country could say upon such subject this writer went through all the usual topics of european showing how diminutive contemptible and helpless an animal was man in his own nature how unable to defend himself from the inclemencies of the air or the fury of wild beasts how much he was excelled by one creature in strength by another in speed by third in foresight by fourth in industry he added that nature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world and could now produce only small abortive births in comparison of those in ancient times he said it was very reasonable to think not only that the species of men were originally much larger but also that there must have been giants in former ages which as it is asserted by history and tradition so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom far exceeding the common dwindled race of man in our days he argued that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should have been made in the beginning of size more large and robust not so liable to destruction from every little accident of tile falling from house or stone cast from the hand of boy or of being drowned in little brook from this way of reasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in the conduct of life but needless here to repeat for my own part could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread of drawing lectures in morality or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining from the quarrels we raise with nature and believe upon strict inquiry those quarrels might be shown as illgrounded among us as they are among that people as to their military affairs they boast that the king army consists of hundred and seventysix thousand foot and thirtytwo thousand horse if that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in the several cities and farmers in the country whose commanders are only the nobility and gentry without pay or reward they are indeed perfect enough in their exercises and under very good discipline wherein saw no great merit for how should it be otherwise where every farmer is under the command of his own landlord and every citizen under that of the principal men in his own city chosen after the manner of venice by ballot p2ch7 paragraph 10 have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise in great field near the city of twenty miles square they were in all not above twentyfive thousand foot and six thousand horse but it was impossible for me to compute their number considering the space of ground they took up cavalier mounted on large steed might be about hundred feet high have seen this whole body of horse upon word of command draw their swords at once and brandish them in the air imagination can figure nothing so grand so surprising and so astonishing it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky was curious to know how this prince to whose dominions there is no access from any other country came to think of armies or to teach his people the practice of military discipline but was soon informed both by conversation and reading their histories for in the course of many ages they have been troubled with the same disease to which the whole race of mankind is subject the nobility often contending for power the people for liberty and the king for absolute dominion all which however happily tempered by the laws of the kingdom have been sometimes violated by each of the three parties and have once or more occasioned civil wars the last whereof was happily put an end to by this prince grandfather by general composition and the militia then settled with common consent has been ever since kept in the strictest duty p2ch8 chapter viii had always strong impulse that should some time recover my liberty though it was impossible to conjecture by what means or to form any project with the least hope of succeeding the ship in which sailed was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast and the king had given strict orders that if at any time another appeared it should be taken ashore and with all its crew and passengers brought in tumbril to lorbrulgrud he was strongly bent to get me woman of my own size by whom might propagate the breed but think should rather have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving posterity to be kept in cages like tame canary birds and perhaps in time sold about the kingdom to persons of quality for curiosities was indeed treated with much kindness was the favorite of great king and queen and the delight of the whole court but it was upon such foot as ill became the dignity of human kind could never forget those domestic pledges had left behind me wanted to be among people with whom could converse upon even terms and walk about the streets and fields without fear of being trod to death like frog or young puppy but my deliverance came sooner than expected and in manner not very common the whole story and circumstances of which shall faithfully relate had now been two years in this country and about the beginning of the third glumdalclitch and attended the king and queen in progress to the coast of the kingdom was carried as usual in my traveling box which as have already described was very convenient closet of twelve feet wide and had ordered hammock to be fixed by silken ropes from the four corners at the top to break the jolts when servant carried me before him on horseback as sometimes desired and would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road on the roof of my closet just over the middle of the hammock ordered the joiner to cut out hole foot square to give me air in hot weather as slept which hole shut at pleasure with board that drew backwards and forwards through groove when we came to our journey end the king thought proper to pass few days at palace he has near flanflasnic city within eighteen english miles of the seaside glumdalclitch and were much fatigued had gotten small cold but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber longed to see the ocean which must be the only scene of my escape if ever it should happen pretended to be worse than really was and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea with page whom was very fond of and who had sometimes been trusted with me shall never forget with what unwillingness glumdalclitch consented nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me bursting at the same time into flood of tears as if she had some foreboding of what was to happen the boy took me out in my box about half an hour walk from the palace towards the rocks on the seashore ordered him to set me down and lifting up one of my sashes cast many wistful melancholy look towards the sea found myself not very well and told the page that had mind to take nap in my hammock which hoped would do me good got in and the boy shut the window close down to keep out the cold soon fell asleep and all can conjecture is that while slept the page thinking no danger could happen went among the rocks to look for birds eggs having before observed him from my window searching about and picking up one or two in the clefts be that as it will found myself suddenly awaked with violent pull upon the ring which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage felt my box raised very high in the air and then borne forward with prodigious speed the first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock but afterwards the motion was easy enough called out several times as loud as could raise my voice but all to no purpose looked towards my windows and could see nothing but the clouds and sky heard noise just over my head like the clapping of wings and then began to perceive the woeful condition was in that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak with an intent to let it fall on rock like tortoise in shell and then pick out my body and devour it for the sagacity and smell of this bird enable him to discover his quarry at great distance though better concealed than could be within twoinch board in little time observed the noise of flutter of wings to increase very fast and my box was tossed up and down like sign post on windy day heard several bangs or buffets as thought given to the eagle for such am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his beak and then all of sudden felt myself falling perpendicularly down for above minute but with such incredible swiftness that almost lost my breath my fall was stopped by terrible squash that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of niagara after which was quite in the dark for another minute and then my box began to rise so high that could see light from the tops of my windows now perceived that had fallen into the sea my box by the weight of my body the goods that were in and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom floated five feet deep in water did then and do now suppose that the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three others and forced to let me drop while he was defending himself against the rest who hoped to share in the prey the plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box for those were the strongest preserved the balance while it fell and hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water every joint of it was well grooved and the door did not move on hinges but up and down like sash which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in got with much difficulty out of my hammock having first ventured to draw back the slipboard on the roof already mentioned contrived on purpose to let in air for want of which found myself almost stifled how often did then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom one single hour had so far divided me and may say with truth that in the midst of my own misfortunes could not forbear lamenting my poor nurse the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasure of the queen and the ruin of her fortune perhaps many travelers have not been under greater difficulties and distress than was at this juncture expecting every moment to see my box dashed in pieces or at least overset by the first violent blast or rising wave breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate death nor could anything have preserved the windows but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside against accidents in traveling saw the water ooze in at several crannies although the leaks were not considerable and endeavored to stop them as well as could was not able to lift up the roof of my closet which otherwise certainly should have done and sat on the top of it where might at least preserve myself some hours longer than by being shut up as may call it in the hold or if escaped these dangers for day or two what could expect but miserable death of cold and hunger was four hours under these circumstances expecting and indeed wishing every moment to be my last p2ch8 paragraph have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed upon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servant who used to carry me on horseback would put leathern belt and buckle it about his waist being in this disconsolate state heard or at least thought beard some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples were fixed and soon after began to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along in the sea for now and then felt sort of tugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows leaving me almost in the dark this gave me some faint hopes of relief although was not able to imagine how it could be brought about ventured to unscrew one of my chairs which were always fastened to the floor and having made hard shift to screw it down again directly under the slippingboard that had lately opened mounted on the chair and putting my mouth as near as could to the hole called for help in loud voice and in all the languages understood then fastened my handkerchief to stick usually carried and thrusting it up the hole waved it several times in the air that if any boat or ship were near the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box found no effect from all could do but plainly perceived my closet to be moved along and in the space of an hour or better that side of the box where the staples were and had no window struck against something that was hard apprehended it to be rock and found myself tossed more than ever plainly heard noise upon the cover of my closet like that of cable and the grating of it as it passed through the ring then found myself hoisted up by degrees at least three feet higher than was before whereupon again thrust up my stick and handkerchief calling for help till was almost hoarse in return to which heard great shout repeated three times giving me such transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them now heard trampling over my head and somebody calling through the hole with loud voice in the english tongue if there be anybody below let them speak answered was an englishman drawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent and begged by all that is moving to be delivered out of the dungeon was in the voice replied was safe for my box was fastened to their ship and the carpenter should immediately come and saw an hole in the cover large enough to pull me out answered that was needless and would take up too much time for there was no more to be done but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring and take the box out of the sea into the ship and so into the captain cabin some of them upon hearing me talk so wildly thought was mad others laughed for indeed it never came into my head that was now among people of my own stature and strength the carpenter came and in few minutes sawed passage about four feet square then let down small ladder upon which mounted and from thence was taken into the ship in very weak condition the sailors were all in amazement and asked me thousand questions which had no inclination to answer was equally confounded at the sight of so many pigmies for such took them to be after having so long accustomed my eyes to the monstrous objects had left but the captain mr thomas wilcocks an honest worthy shropshire man observing was ready to faint took me into his cabin gave me cordial to comfort me and made me turn in upon his own bed advising me to take little rest of which had great need before went to sleep gave him to understand that had some valuable furniture in my box too good to be lost fine hammock handsome field bed two chairs table and cabinet that my closet was hung on all sides or rather quilted with silk and cotton that if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin would open it there before him and show him my goods the captain hearing me utter these absurdities concluded was raving however suppose to pacify me he promised to give order as desired and going upon deck sent some of his men down into my closet from whence as afterwards found they drew up all my goods and stripped off the quilting but the chairs cabinet and bedstead being screwed to the floor were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen who tore them up by force then they knocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship and when they had got all they had mind for let the hull drop into the sea which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom and sides sunk to rights and indeed was glad not to have been spectator of the havoc they made because am confident it would have sensibly touched me by bringing former passages into my mind which had rather forget slept some hours but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place had left and the dangers had escaped however upon waking found myself much recovered it was now about eight oclock at night and the captain ordered supper immediately thinking had already fasted too long he entertained me with great kindness observing me not to look wildly or talk inconsistently and when we were left alone desired would give him relation of my travels and by what accident came to be set adrift in that monstrous wooden chest he said that about twelve oclock at noon as he was looking through his glass he spied it at distance and thought it was sail which he had mind to make being not much out of his course in hopes of buying some biscuit his own beginning to fall short that upon coming nearer and finding his error he sent out his longboat to discover what was that his men came back in fright swearing they had seen swimming house that he laughed at their folly and went himself in the boat ordering his men to take strong cable along with them that the weather being calm he rowed round me several times observed my windows and the wire lattices that defended them that he discovered two staples upon one side which was all of boards without any passage for light he then commanded his men to row up to that side and fastening cable to one of the staples ordered them to tow my chest as he called it towards the ship when it was there he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover and to raise up my chest with pulley which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet he said they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and concluded that some unhappy men must be shut up in the cavity asked whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air about the time he first discovered me to which he answered that discoursing this matter with the sailors while was asleep one of them said he had observed three eagles flying towards the north but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size which suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at and he could not guess the reason of my question then asked the captain how far he reckoned we might be from land he said by the best computation he could make we were at least hundred leagues assured him that he must be mistaken by almost half for had not left the country from where came above two hours before dropped into the sea whereupon he began again to think that my brain was disturbed of which he gave me hint and advised me to go to bed in cabin he had provided assured him was well refreshed with his good entertainment and company and as much in my senses as ever was in my life he then grew serious and desired to ask me freely whether were not troubled in mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime for which was punished at the command of some prince by exposing me in that chest as great criminals in other countries have been forced to sea in leaky vessel without provisions for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill man into his ship yet he would engage his word to set me safe on shore in the first port where we arrived he added that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd speeches had delivered at first to the sailors and afterwards to himself in relation to my closet or chest as well as by my odd looks and behavior while was at supper begged his patience to hear me tell my story which faithfully did from the last time left england to the moment he first discovered me and as truth always forces its way into rational minds so this honest worthy gentleman who had some tincture of learning and very good sense was immediately convinced of my candor and veracity but further to confirm all had said entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought of which had the key in my pocket for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet opened it in his presence and showed him the small collection of rarities made in the country from where had been so strangely delivered there was comb had contrived out of the stumps of the king beard and another of the same materials but fixed into paring of her majesty thumbnail which served for the back there was collection of needles and pins from foot to half yard long four waspstings like joiners tacks some combings of the queen hair gold ring which one day she made me present of in most obliging manner taking it from her little finger and throwing it over my head like collar desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return of his civilities which he absolutely refused showed him corn that had cut off with my own hand from maid of honor toe it was about the bigness of kentish pippin and grown so hard that when returned to england got it hollowed into cup and set in silver lastly desired him to see the breeches had then on which were made of mouse skin p2ch8 paragraph 10 could force nothing on him but footman tooth which observed him to examine with great curiosity and found he had fancy for it he received it with abundance of thanks more than such trifle could deserve it was drawn by an unskillful surgeon in mistake from one of glumdalclitch men who was afflicted with the toothache but it was as sound as any in his head got it cleaned and put it into my cabinet it was about foot long and four inches in diameter the captain was very well satisfied with plain relation had given him and said he hoped when we returned to england would oblige the world by putting it in paper and making it public my answer was that thought we were already overstocked with books of travels that nothing could now pass which was not extraordinary wherein doubted some authors less consulted truth than their own vanity or interest or the diversion of ignorant readers that my story could contain little besides common events without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants trees birds and other animals or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of savage people with which most writers abound however thanked him for his good opinion and promised to take the matter into my thoughts he said he wondered at one thing very much which was to bear me speak so loud asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thick of hearing told him it was what had been used to for above two years past and that admired as much at the voices of him and his men who seemed to me only to whisper and yet could hear them well enough but when spoke in that country it was like man talking in the street to another looking out from the top of steeple unless when was placed on table or held in any person hand told him had likewise observed another thing that when first got into the ship and the sailors stood all about me thought they were the most little contemptible creatures had ever beheld for indeed while was in that prince country could never endure to look in glass after my eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects because the comparison gave me so despicable conceit of myself the captain said that while we were at supper he observed me look at everything with sort of wonder and that often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter which he knew not well how to take but imputed it to some disorder in my brain answered it was very true and wondered how could forbear when saw his dishes of the size of silver threepence leg of pork hardly mouthful cup not so big as nutshell and so went on describing the rest of his household stuff and provisions after the same manner for although the queen had ordered little equipage of all things necessary for me while was in her service yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what saw on every side of me and winked at my own littleness as people do at their own faults the captain understood my raillery very well and merrily replied with the old english proverb that he doubted my eyes were bigger than my belly for he did not observe my stomach so good although had fasted all day and continuing in his mirth protested he would have gladly given hundred pounds to have seen my closet in the eagle bill and afterwards in its fall from so great height into the sea which would certainly have been most astonishing object worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future ages and the comparison of phaeton was so obvious that he could not forbear applying it although did not much admire the conceit the captain having been at tonquin was in his return to england driven northeastward to the latitude of 44 degrees and of longitude 143 but meeting trade wind two days after came on board him we sailed southward long time and coasting new holland kept our course westsouthwest and then southsouthwest till we doubled the cape of good hope our voyage was very prosperous but shall not trouble the reader with journal of it the captain called in at one or two ports and sent in his longboat for provisions and fresh water but never went out of the ship till we came into the downs which was on the third day of june 1706 about nine months after my escape offered to leave my goods in security for payment of my freight but the captain protested he would not receive one farthing we took kind leave of each other and made him promise he would come to see me at my house in redriff hired horse and guide for five shillings which borrowed of the captain as was on the road observing the littleness of the houses the trees the cattle and the people began to think myself in lilliput was afraid of trampling on every traveler met and often called aloud to have them stand out of the way so that had like to have gotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence p2ch8 paragraph 15 when came to my own house for which was forced to enquire one of the servants opening the door bent down to go in like goose under gate for fear of striking my head my wife ran out to embrace me but stooped lower than her knees thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my mouth my daughter kneeled to ask my blessing but could not see her till she arose having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet and then went to take her up with one hand by the waist looked down upon the servants and one or two friends who were in the house as if they had been pigmies and giant told my wife she had been too thrifty for found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing in short behaved myself so unaccountably that they were all of the captain opinion when he first saw me and concluded had lost my wits this mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice in little time and my family and friends came to right understanding but my wife protested should never go to sea any more although my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to hinder me as the reader may know hereafter in the mean time here conclude the second part of my unfortunate voyages the end of the second part part iii voyage to laputa balnibarbi glubbdubdrib luggnagg and japan see plate p3ch1 chapter had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson cornish man commander of the hopewell stout ship of three hundred tons came to my house had formerly been surgeon of another ship where he was master and fourth part owner in voyage to the levant he had always treated me more like brother than an inferior officer and hearing of my arrival made me visit as apprehended only out of friendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after long absences but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find me in good health asking whether were now settled for life adding that he intended voyage to the east indies in two months at last he plainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of the ship that should have another surgeon under me besides our two mates that my salary should be double to the usual pay and that having experienced my knowledge in sea affairs to be at least equal to his he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if had share in the command he said so many other obliging things and knew him to be so honest man that could not reject his proposal the thirst had of seeing the world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent as ever the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whose consent however at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she proposed to her children we set out the 5th of august 1706 and arrived at fort st george the 11th of april 1707 we stayed there three weeks to refresh our crew many of whom were sick from there we went to tonquin where the captain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods he intended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched in some months therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be at he bought sloop loaded it with several sorts of goods wherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighboring islands and putting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country he appointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic for two months while he transacted his affairs at tonquin we had not sailed more than three days when great storm arising we were driven five days to the northnortheast and then to the east after which we had fair weather but still with pretty strong gale from the west upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soon overtook us for my sloop was so deep loaden that she sailed very slow neither were we in condition to defend ourselves we were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who entered furiously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon our faces for so gave order they pinioned us with strong ropes and setting guard upon us went to search the sloop p3ch1 paragraph observed among them dutchman who seemed to be of some authority though he was not commander of either ship he knew us by our countenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own language swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea spoke dutch tolerably well told him who we were and begged him in consideration of our being christians and protestants of neighboring countries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to take some pity on us this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings and turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese language as suppose often using the word christianos the largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by japanese captain who spoke little dutch but very imperfectly he came up to me and after several questions which answered in great humility he said we should not die made the captain very low bow and then turning to the dutchman said was sorry to find more mercy in heathen than in brother christian but had soon reason to repent those foolish words for that malicious reprobate having often endeavored in vain to persuade both the captains that might be thrown into the sea which they would not yield to after the promise made me that should not die however prevailed so far as to have punishment inflicted on me worse in all human appearance than death itself my men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new manned as to myself it was determined that should be set adrift in small canoe with paddles and sail and four days provisions which last the japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores and would permit no man to search me got down into the canoe while the dutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could afford about an hour before we saw the pirates had taken an observation and found we were in the latitude of 46 and of longitude 183 when was at some distance from the pirates discovered by my pocket glass several islands to the southeast set up my sail the wind being fair with design to reach the nearest of those islands which made shift to do in about three hours it was all rocky however got many birds eggs and striking fire kindled some heath and dry seaweed by which roasted my eggs ate no other supper being resolved to spare my provisions as much as could passed the night under the shelter of rock strowing some heath under me and slept pretty well the next day sailed to another island and then to third and fourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles but not to trouble the reader with particular account of my distresses let it suffice that on the fifth day arrived at the last island in my sight which lay southsoutheast to the former this island was at greater distance than expected and did not reach it in less than five hours encompassed it almost around before could find convenient place to land in which was small creek about three times the wideness of my canoe found the island to be all rocky only little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweet smelling herbs took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself secured the remainder in cave whereof there were great numbers gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got quantity of dry seaweed and parched grass which designed to kindle the next day and roast my eggs as well as could for had about me my flint steel match and burning glass lay all night in the cave where had lodged my provisions my bed was the same dry grass and seaweed which intended for fuel slept very little for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness and kept me awake considered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate place and how miserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and desponding that had not the heart to rise and before could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave the day was far advanced walked while among the rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that was forced to turn my face from it when all of sudden it became obscured as thought in manner very different from what happens by the interposition of cloud turned back and perceived vast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemed to be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but did not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened than if had stood under the shade of mountain as it approached nearer over the place where was it appeared to be firm substance the bottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of the sea below stood upon height about two hundred yards from the shore and saw this vast body descending almost to parallel with me at less than an english mile distance took out my pocket perspective and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of it which appeared to be sloping but what those people were doing was not able to distinguish p3ch1 paragraph 10 the natural love of life gave me some inward motions of joy and was ready to entertain hope that this adventure might some way or other help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition was in but at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment to behold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able as it should seem to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as they pleased but not being at that time in disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon rather chose to observe what course the island would take because it seemed for while to stand still yet soon after it advanced nearer and could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals to descend from one to the other in the lowest gallery beheld some people fishing with long angling rods and others looking on waved my cap for my hat was long since worn out and my handkerchief towards the island and upon its nearer approach called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly beheld crowd gather to that side which was most in my view found by their pointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered me although they made no return to my shouting but could see four or five men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island who then disappeared happened rightly to conjecture that these were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion the number of people increased and in less than half an hour the island was moved and raised in such manner that the lowest gallery appeared in parallel of less than hundred yards distance from the height where stood then put myself into the most supplicating postures and spoke in the humblest accent but received no answer those who stood nearest over against me seemed to be persons of distinction as supposed by their habit they conferred earnestly with each other looking often upon me at length one of them called out in clear polite smooth dialect not unlike in sound to the italian and therefore returned an answer in that language hoping at least that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears although neither of us understood the other yet my meaning was easily known for the people saw the distress was in they made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards the shore which accordingly did and the flying island being raised to convenient height the verge directly over me chain was let down from the lowest gallery with seat fastened to the bottom to which fixed myself and was drawn up by pulleys p3ch2 chapter ii at my alighting was surrounded by crowd of people but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better quality they beheld me with all the marks and circumstances of wonder neither indeed was much in their debt having never till then seen race of mortals so singular in their shapes habits and countenances their heads were all reclined either to the right or the left one of their eyes turned inward and the other directly up to the zenith their outward garments were adorned with the figures of suns moons and stars interwoven with those of fiddles flutes harps trumpets guitars harpsichords and many other instruments of music unknown to us in europe observed here and there many in the habit of servants with blown bladder fastened like flail to the end of short stick which they carried in their hands in each bladder was small quantity of dried pease or little pebbles as was afterwards informed with these bladders they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them of which practice could not then conceive the meaning it seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can speak nor attend to the discourses of others without being roused by some external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing for which reason those persons who are able to afford it always keep flapper the original is climenole in their family as one of their domestics nor ever walk abroad or make visits without him and the business of this officer is when two or more persons are in company gently to strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself this flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks and upon occasion to give him soft flap on his eyes because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice and bouncing his head against every post and in the streets of jostling others or being jostled himself into the kennel it was necessary to give the reader this information without which he would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these people as they conducted me the stairs to the top of the island and from there to the royal palace while we were ascending they forgot several times what they were about and left me to myself till their memories were again roused by their flappers for they appeared altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance and by the shouts of the vulgar whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged at last we entered the palace and proceeded into the chamber of presence where saw the king seated on his throne attended on each side by persons of prime quality before the throne was large table filled with globes and spheres and mathematical instruments of all kinds his majesty took not the least notice of us although our entrance was not without sufficient noise by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court but he was then deep in problem and we attended at least an hour before he could solve it there stood by him on each side young page with flaps in their hands and when they saw he was at leisure one of them gently struck his mouth and the other his right ear at which he started like one awakened on the sudden and looking towards me and the company was in recollected the occasion of our coming whereof he had been informed before he spoke some words whereupon immediately young man with flap came up to my side and flapped me gently on the right ear but made signs as well as could that had no occasion for such an instrument which as afterwards found gave his majesty and the whole court very mean opinion of my understanding the king as far as could conjecture asked me several questions and addressed myself to him in all the languages had when it was found that could neither understand nor be understood was conducted by the king order to an apartment in his palace this prince being distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to strangers where two servants were appointed to attend me my dinner was brought and four persons of quality whom remembered to have seen very near the king person did me the honor to dine with me we had two courses of three dishes each in the first course there was shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle piece of beef into rhomboides and pudding into cycloid the second course was two ducks trussed up into the form of fiddles sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys and breast of veal in the shape of harp the servants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and several other mathematical figures while we were at dinner made bold to ask the names of several things in their language and those noble persons by the assistance of their flappers delighted to give me answers hoping to raise my admiration of their great abilities if could be brought to converse with them was soon able to call for bread and drink or whatever else wanted after dinner my company withdrew and person was sent to me by the king order attended by flapper he brought with him pen ink and paper and three or four books giving me to understand by signs that he was sent to teach me the language we sat together four hours in which time wrote down great number of words in columns with the translations over against them likewise made shift to learn several short sentences for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch something to turn about to make bow to sit or stand or walk and the like then took down the sentence in writing he showed me also in one of his books the figures of the sun moon and stars the zodiac the tropics and polar circles together with the denominations of many figures of planes and solids he gave me the names and descriptions of all the musical instruments and the general terms of art in playing on each of them after he had left me placed all my words with their interpretations in alphabetical order and thus in few days by the help of very faithful memory got some insight into their language p3ch2 paragraph the word which interpret the flying or floating island is in the original laputa whereof could never learn the true etymology lap in the old obsolete language signifies high and untuh governor from which they say by corruption was derived laputa from lapuntuh but do not approve of this derivation which seems to be little strained ventured to offer to the learned among them conjecture of my own that laputa was quasi lap outed lap signifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea and outed wing which however shall not obtrude but submit to the judicious reader those to whom the king had entrusted me observing how ill was clad ordered tailor to come next morning and take my measure for suit of clothes this operator did his office after different manner from those of his trade in europe he first took my height by quadrant and then with rule and compasses described the dimensions and outlines of my whole body all which he entered upon paper and in six days brought my clothes very ill made and quite out of shape by happening to mistake figure in the calculation but my comfort was that observed such accidents very frequent and little regarded during my confinement for want of clothes and by an indisposition that held me some days longer much enlarged my dictionary and when went next to court was able to understand many things the king spoke and to return him some kind of answers his majesty had given orders that the island should move northeast and by east to the vertical point over lagado the metropolis of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earth it was about ninety leagues distant and our voyage lasted four days and an half was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made in the air by the island on the second morning about eleven oclock the king himself in person attended by his nobility courtiers and officers having prepared all their musical instruments played on them for three hours without intermission so that was quite stunned with the noise neither could possibly guess the meaning till my tutor informed me he said that the people of their island had their ears adapted to hear the music of the spheres which always played at certain periods and the court was now prepared to bear their part in whatever instrument they most excelled in our journey towards lagado the capital city his majesty ordered that the island should stop over certain towns and villages from whence he might receive the petitions of his subjects and to this purpose several packthreads were let down with small weights at the bottom on these packthreads the people strung their petitions which mounted up directly like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of the string that holds their kite sometimes we received wine and victuals from below which were drawn up by pulleys the knowledge had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiring their phraseology which depended much upon that science and music and in the latter was not unskilled their ideas are perpetually conversant in lines and figures if they would for example praise the beauty of woman or any other animal they describe it by rhombs circles parallelograms ellipses and other geometrical terms or by words of art drawn from music needless here to repeat observed in the king kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his majesty table p3ch2 paragraph 10 their houses are very ill built the walls bevel without one right angle in any apartment and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to practical geometry which they despise as vulgar and mechanic those instructions they give being too refined for the intellectuals of their workmen which occasions perpetual mistakes and although they are dexterous enough upon piece of paper in the management of the rule the pencil and the divider yet in the common actions and behavior of life have not seen more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor so slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects except those of mathematics and music they are very bad reasoners and vehemently given to opposition unless when they happen to be of the right opinion which is seldom their case imagination fancy and invention they are wholly strangers to nor have any words in their language by which those ideas can be expressed the whole compass of their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned sciences most of them and especially those who deal in the astronomical part have great faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to own it publicly but what chiefly admired and thought altogether unaccountable was the strong disposition observed in them towards news and politics perpetually enquiring into public affairs giving their judgments in matters of state and passionately disputing every inch of party opinion have indeed observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians have known in europe although could never discover the least analogy between the two sciences unless those people suppose that because the smallest circle hath as many degrees as the largest therefore the regulation and management of the world require no more abilities than the handling and turning of globe but rather take this quality to spring from very common infirmity of human nature inclining us to be more curious and conceited in matters where we have least concern and for which we are least adapted either by study or nature these people are under continual disquietudes never enjoying minute peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance that the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must in course of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sun will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more light to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped brush from the tail of the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes and that the next which they have calculated for thirtyone years hence will probably destroy us for if in its perihelion it should approach within certain degree of the sun as by their calculations they have reason to dread it will conceive degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of redhot glowing iron and in its absence from the sun carry blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet it must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that the sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended with the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light from it they are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures or amusements of life when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question is about the sun health how he looked at his setting and rising and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet this conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of sprites and hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for fear the women of the island have abundance of vivacity they contemn their husbands and are exceedingly fond of strangers whereof there is always considerable number from the continent below attending at court either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations or their own particular occasions but are much despised because they want the same endowments among these the ladies choose their gallants but the vexation is that they act with too much ease and security for the husband is always so rapt in speculation that the mistress and lover may proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face if he be but provided with paper and implements and without his flapper at his side p3ch2 paragraph 15 the wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island although think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world and although they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence and are allowed to do whatever they please they long to see the world and take the diversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to do without particular license from the king and this is not easy to be obtained because the people of quality have found by frequent experience how hard it is to persuade their women to return from below was told that great court lady who had several children is married to the prime minister the richest subject in the kingdom very graceful person extremely fond of her and lives in the finest palace of the island went down to lagado on the pretense of health there hid herself for several months till the king sent warrant to search for her and she was found in an obscure eatinghouse all in rags having pawned her clothes to maintain an old deformed footman who beat her every day and in whose company she was taken much against her will and although her husband received her with all possible kindness and without the least reproach she soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels to the same gallant and has not been heard of since this may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or english story than for one of country so remote but he may please to consider that the caprices of are not limited by any climate or nation and that they are much more uniform than can be easily imagined in about month time had made tolerable proficiency in their language and was able to answer most of the king questions when had the honor to attend him his majesty discovered not the least curiosity to inquire into the laws government history religion or manners of the countries where had been but confined his questions to the state of mathematics and received the account gave him with great contempt and indifference though often roused by his flapper on each side p3ch3 chapter iii desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island which he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor to attend me chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature it owed its several motions whereof will now give philosophical account to the reader the flying or floating island is exactly circular its diameter 7837 yards or about four miles and half and consequently contains ten thousand acres it is three hundred yards thick the bottom or under surface which appears to those who view it from below is one even regular plate of adamant shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards above it lie the several minerals in their usual order and over all is coat of rich mold ten or twelve feet deep the declivity of the upper surface from the circumference to the center is the natural cause why all the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed in small rivulets toward the middle where they are emptied into four large basins each of about half mile in circuit and two hundred yards distant from the center from these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the daytime which effectually prevents their overflowing besides as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the island above the region of clouds and vapors he can prevent the falling of dews and rains whenever he pleases for the highest clouds can not rise above two miles as naturalists agree at least they were never known to do so in that country at the centre of the island there is chasm about fifty yards in diameter from whence the astronomers descend into large dome which is therefore called flandona gagnole or the astronomer cave situated at the depth of hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant in this cave are twenty lamps continually burning which from the reflection of the adamant cast strong light into every part the place is stored with great variety of sextants quadrants telescopes astrolabes and other astronomical instruments but the greatest curiosity upon which the fate of the island depends is loadstone of prodigious size in shape resembling weaver shuttle it is in length six yards and in the thickest part at least three yards over this magnet is sustained by very strong axle of adamant passing through its middle upon which it plays and is poised so exactly that the weakest hand can turn it it is hooped round with hollow cylinder of adamant four feet deep as many thick and twelve yards in diameter placed horizontally and supported by eight adamantine feet each six yards high in the middle of the concave side there is groove twelve inches deep in which the extremities of the axle are lodged and turned round as there is occasion the stone can not be moved from its place by any force because the hoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which constitutes the bottom of the island by means of this loadstone the island is made to rise and fall and move from one place to another for with respect to that part of the earth over which the monarch presides the stone is endued at one of its sides with an attractive power and at the other with repulsive upon placing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the earth the island descends but when the repelling extremity points downwards the island mounts directly upwards when the position of the stone is oblique the motion of the island is so too for in this magnet the forces always act in lines parallel to its direction p3ch3 paragraph see plate by this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of the monarch dominions to explain the manner of its progress let ab represent line drawn cross the dominions of balnibarbi let the line cd represent the loadstone of which let be the repelling end and the attracting end the island being over let the stone be placed in the position cd with its repelling end downwards then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards when it is arrived at let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting end points towards and then the island will be carried obliquely towards where if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in the position ef with its repelling point downwards the island will rise obliquely towards where by directing the attracting end towards the island may be carried to and from to by turning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity point directly downwards and thus by changing the situation of the stone as often as there is occasion the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction and by those alternate risings and fallings the obliquity being not considerable is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other but it must be observed that this island can not move beyond the extent of the dominions below nor can it rise above the height of four miles for which the astronomers who have written large systems concerning the stone assign the following reason that the magnetic virtue does not extend beyond the distance of four miles and that the mineral which acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth and in the sea about six leagues distant from the shore is not diffused through the whole globe but terminated with the limits of the king dominions and it was easy from the great advantage of such superior situation for prince to bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the island stands still for in that case the extremities of it being at equal distance from the earth act with equal force the one in drawing downwards the other in pushing upwards and consequently no motion can ensue this loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers who from time to time give it such positions as the monarch directs they spend the greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies which they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness for although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet they magnify much more than those of hundred yards among us and at the same time show the stars with greater clearness this advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much farther than our astronomers in europe for they have made catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one third part of that number they have likewise discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about mars whereof the innermost is distant from the center of the primary planet exactly three of his diameters and the outermost five the former revolves in the space of ten hours and the latter in twentyone and half so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the center of mars which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies p3ch3 paragraph 10 they have observed ninetythree different comets and settled their periods with great exactness if this be true and they affirm it with great confidence it is much to be wished that their observations were made public whereby the theory of comets which at present is very lame and defective might be brought to the same perfection with other parts of astronomy the king would be the most absolute prince in the universe if he could but prevail on ministry to join with him but these having their estates below on the continent and considering that the office of favorite has very uncertain tenure would never consent to the enslaving their country if any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny fall into violent factions or refuse to pay the usual tribute the king has two methods of reducing them to obedience the first and the mildest course by keeping the island hovering over such town and the lands about it whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain and consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if the crime deserve it they are at the same time pelted from above with great stones against which they have no defense but by creeping into cellars or caves while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces but if they still continue obstinate or offer to raise insurrections he proceeds to the last remedy by letting the island drop directly upon their heads which makes universal destruction both of houses and men however this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution nor dare his ministers advise him to an action which as it would render them odious to the people so it would be great damage to their own estates which lie all below for the island is the king demesne but there is still indeed more weighty reason why the kings of this country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action unless upon the utmost necessity for if the town intended to be destroyed should have in it any tall rocks as it generally falls out in the larger cities situation probably chosen at first with view to prevent such catastrophe or if it abound in high spires or pillars of stone sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the island which although it consist as have said of one entire adamant two hundred yards thick might happen to crack by too great shock or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below as the backs both of iron and stone will often do in our chimneys of all this the people are well apprised and understand how far to carry their obstinacy where their liberty or property is concerned and the king when he is highest provoked and most determined to press city to rubbish orders the island to descend with great gentleness out of pretense of tenderness to his people but indeed for fear of breaking the adamantine bottom in which case it is the opinion of all their philosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up and the whole mass would fall to the ground about three years before my arrival among them while the king was in his progress over his dominions there happened an extraordinary accident which had like to have put period to the fate of that monarchy at least as it is now instituted lindalino the second city in the kingdom was the first his majesty visited in his progress three days after his departure the inhabitants who had often complained of great oppressions shut the town gates seized on the governor and with incredible speed and labor erected four large towers one at every corner of the city which is an exact square equal in height to strong pointed rock that stands directly in the center of the city upon the top of each tower as well as upon the rock they fixed great loadstone and in case their design should fail they had provided vast quantity of the most combustible fuel hoping to burst therewith the adamantine bottom of the island if the loadstone project should miscarry p3ch3 paragraph 15 it was eight months before the king had perfect notice that the lindalinians were in rebellion he then commanded that the island should be wafted over the city the people were unanimous and had laid in stores of provisions and great river runs through the middle of the town the king hovered over them several days to deprive them of the sun and the rain he ordered many packthreads to be let down yet not person offered to send up petition but instead thereof very bold demands the redress of all their grievances great immunities the choice of their own governor and other like exorbitances upon which his majesty commanded all the inhabitants of the island to cast great stones from the lower gallery into the town but the citizens had provided against this mischief by conveying their persons and effects into the four towers and other strong buildings and vaults underground the king being now determined to reduce this proud people ordered that the island should descend gently within forty yards of the top of the towers and rock this was accordingly done but the officers employed in that work found the descent much speedier than usual and by turning the loadstone could not without great difficulty keep it in firm position but found the island inclining to fall they sent the king immediate intelligence of this astonishing event and begged his majesty permission to raise the island higher the king consented general council was called and the officers of the loadstone ordered to attend one of the oldest and most expert among them obtained leave to try an experiment he took strong line of hundred yards and the island being raised over the town above the attracting power they had felt he fastened piece of adamant to the end of his line which had in it mixture of iron mineral of the same nature with that whereof the bottom or lower surface of the island is composed and from the lower gallery let it down slowly towards the top of the towers the adamant was not descended four yards before the officer felt it drawn so strongly downward that he could hardly pull it back he then threw down several small pieces of adamant and observed that they were all violently attracted by the top of the tower the same experiment was made on the other three towers and on the rock with the same effect this incident broke entirely the king measures and to dwell no longer on other circumstances he was forced to give the town their own conditions was assured by great minister that if the island had descended so near the town as not to be able to raise itself the citizens were determined to fix it for ever to kill the king and all his servants and entirely change the government by fundamental law of this realm neither the king nor either of his two elder sons are permitted to leave the island nor the queen till she is past childbearing p3ch4 chapter iv although can not say that was ill treated in this island yet must confess thought myself too much neglected not without some degree of contempt for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any part of knowledge except mathematics and music wherein was far their inferior and upon that account very little regarded on the other side after having seen all the curiosities of the island was very desirous to leave it being heartily weary of those people they were indeed excellent in two sciences for which have great esteem and wherein am not unversed but at the same time so abstracted and involved in speculation that never met with such disagreeable companions conversed only with women tradesmen flappers and court pages during two months of my abode there by which at last rendered myself extremely contemptible yet these were the only people from whom could ever receive reasonable answer had obtained by hard study good degree of knowledge in their language was weary of being confined to an island where received so little countenance and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity there was great lord at court nearly related to the king and for that reason alone used with respect he was universally reckoned the most ignorant and stupid person among them he had performed many eminent services for the crown had great natural and acquired parts adorned with integrity and honor but so ill an ear for music that his detractors reported he had been often known to beat time in the wrong place neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach him to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics he was pleased to show me many marks of favor often did me the honor of visit desired to be informed in the affairs of europe the laws and customs the manners and learning of the several countries where had traveled he listened to me with great attention and made very wise observations on all spoke he had two flappers attending him for state but never made use of them except at court and in visits of ceremony and would always command them to withdraw when we were alone together entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with his majesty for leave to depart which he accordingly did as he was pleased to tell me with regret for indeed he had made me several offers very advantageous which however refused with expressions of the highest acknowledgment p3ch4 paragraph on the 16th day of february took leave of his majesty and the court the king made me present to the value of about two hundred pounds english and my protector his kinsman as much more together with letter of recommendation to friend of his in lagado the metropolis the island being then hovering over mountain about two miles from it was let down from the lowest gallery in the same manner as had been taken up the continent as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying island passes under the general name of balnibarbi and the metropolis as said before is called lagado felt some little satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground walked to the city without any concern being clad like one of the natives and sufficiently instructed to converse with them soon found out the person house to whom was ended presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the island and was received with much kindness this great lord whose name was munodi ordered me an apartment in his own house where continued during my stay and was entertained in most hospitable manner the next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see the town which is about half the size of london but the houses very strangely built and most of them out of repair the people in the streets walked fast looked wild their eyes fixed and were generally in rags we passed through one of the town gates and went about three miles into the country where saw many laborers working with several sorts of tools in the ground but was not able to conjecture what they were about neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass although the soil appeared to be excellent could not forbear admiring at these odd appearances both in town and country and made bold to desire my conductor that he would be pleased to explain to me what could be meant by so many busy heads hands and faces both in the streets and the fields because did not discover any good effects they produced but on the contrary never knew soil so unhappily cultivated houses so ill contrived and so ruinous or people whose countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want this lord munodi was person of the first rank and had been some years governor of lagado but by cabal of ministers was discharged for insufficiency however the king treated him with tenderness as wellmeaning man but of low contemptible understanding when gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he made no further answer than by telling me that had not been long enough among them to form judgment and that the different nations of the world had different customs with other common topics to the same purpose but when we returned to his palace he asked me how liked the building what absurdities observed and what quarrel had with the dress or looks of his domestics this he might safely do because every thing about him was magnificent regular and polite answered that his excellency prudence quality and fortune had exempted him from those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others he said if would go with him to his country house about twenty miles distant where his estate lay there would be more leisure for this kind of conversation told his excellency that was entirely at his disposal and accordingly we set out next morning p3ch4 paragraph 10 during our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers in managing their lands which to me were wholly unaccountable for except in some very few places could not discover one ear of corn or blade of grass but in three hours traveling the scene was wholly altered we came into most beautiful country farmers houses at small distances neatly built the fields enclosed containing vineyards corn grounds and meadows neither do remember to have seen more delightful prospect his excellency observed my countenance to clear up he told me with sigh that there his estate began and would continue the same till we should come to his house that his countrymen ridiculed and despised him for managing his affairs no better and for setting so ill an example to the kingdom which however was followed by very few such as were old and willful and weak like himself we came at length to the house which was indeed noble structure built according to the best rules of ancient architecture the fountains gardens walks avenues and groves were all disposed with exact judgment and taste gave due praises to every thing saw whereof his excellency took not the least notice till after supper when there being no third companion he told me with very melancholy air that he doubted he must thrown down his houses in town and country to rebuild them after the present mode destroy all his plantations and cast others into such form as modern usage required and give the same directions to all his tenants unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride singularity affectation ignorance caprice and perhaps increase his majesty displeasure that the admiration appeared to be under would cease or diminish when he had informed me of some particulars which probably never heard of at court the people there being too much taken up in their own speculations to have regard to what passed here below the sum of his discourse was to this effect that about forty years ago certain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversion and after five months continuance came back with very little smattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in that airy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike the management of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting all arts sciences languages and mechanics upon new foot to this end they procured royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in lagado and the humor prevailed so strongly among the people that there is not town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all trades and manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the work of ten palace may be built in week of materials so durable as to last forever without repairing all the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose and increase hundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happy proposals the only inconvenience is that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection and in the meantime the whole country lies miserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food or clothes by all which instead of being discouraged they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equally on by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprising spirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houses his ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of life without innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry had done the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and illwill as enemies to art ignorant and ill commonwealthsmen preferring their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their country his lordship added that he would not by any further particulars prevent the pleasure should certainly take in viewing the grand academy whither he was resolved should go he only desired me to observe ruined building upon the side of mountain about three miles distant of which he gave me this account that he had very convenient mill within half mile of his house turned by current from large river and sufficient for his own family as well as great number of his tenants that about seven years ago club of those projectors came to him with proposals to destroy this mill and build another on the side of that mountain on the long ridge whereof long canal must be cut for repository of water to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply the mill because the wind and air upon height agitated the water and thereby made it fitter for motion and because the water descending down declivity would turn the mill with half the current of river whose course is more upon level he said that being then not very well with the court and pressed by many of his friends he complied with the proposal and after employing an hundred men for two years the work miscarried the projectors went off laying the blame entirely upon him railing at him ever since and putting others upon the same experiment with equal assurance of success as well as equal disappointment p3ch4 paragraph 15 in few days we came back to town and his excellency considering the bad character he had in the academy would not go with me himself but recommended me to friend of his to bear me company thither my lord was pleased to represent me as great admirer of projects and person of much curiosity and easy belief which indeed was not without truth for had myself been sort of projector in my younger days p3ch5 chapter this academy is not an entire single building but continuation of several houses on both sides of street which growing waste was purchased and applied to that use was received very kindly by the warden and went for many days to the academy every room has in it one or more projectors and believe could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms the first man saw was of meager aspect with sooty hands and face his hair and beard long ragged and singed in several places his clothes shirt and skin were all of the same color he had been eight years upon project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers which were to be put into vials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers he told me he did not doubt in eight years more he should be able to supply the governor gardens with sunshine at reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was low and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity especially since this had been very dear season for cucumbers made him small present for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them went into another chamber but was ready to hasten back being almost overcome with horrible stink my conductor pressed me forward conjuring me in whisper to give no offense which would be highly resented and therefore dare not so much as stop my nose the projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy his face and beard were of pale yellow his hands and clothes daubed over with filth when was presented to him he gave me close embrace compliment could well have excused his employment from his first coming into the academy was an operation to reduce human excrement to its original food by separating the several parts removing the tincture which it receives from the gall making the odor exhale and off the saliva he had weekly allowance from the society of vessel filled with human ordure about the size of bristol barrel saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder who likewise showed me treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire which he intended to publish p3ch5 paragraph there was most ingenious architect who had contrived new method for building houses by beginning at the roof and working downwards to the foundation which he justified to me by the like practice of those two prudent insects the bee and the spider there was man born blind who had several apprentices in his own condition their employment was to mix colors for painters which their master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling it was indeed my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their lessons and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity in another apartment was highly pleased with projector who had found device of ploughing the ground with hogs to save the charges of plows cattle and labor the method in this in an acre of ground you bury at six inches distance and eight deep quantity of acorns dates chestnuts and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals are fondest then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field where in few days they will root up the whole ground in search of their food and make it fit for sowing at the same time manuring it with their dung it is true upon experiment they found the charge and trouble very great and they had little or no crop however it is not doubted that this invention may be capable of great improvement went into another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung round with cobwebs except narrow passage for the artist to go in and out at my entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his webs he lamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of using silk worms while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely excelled the former because they understood how to weave as well as spin and he proposed farther that by employing spiders the charge of dyeing silks should be wholly saved whereof was fully convinced when he showed me vast number of flies most beautifully colored wherewith he fed his spiders assuring us that the webs would take tincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fit everybody fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies of certain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give strength and consistence to the threads there was an astronomer who had undertaken to place sundial upon the great weathercock on the townhouse by adjusting the annual and diurnal motions of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincide with all accidental turnings by the wind p3ch5 paragraph 10 was complaining of small fit of the colic upon which my conductor led me into room where great physician resided who was famous for curing that disease by contrary operations from the same instrument he had large pair of bellows with long slender muzzle of ivory this he conveyed eight inches up the anus and drawing in the wind he affirmed he could make the guts as lank as dried bladder but when the disease was more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzle while the bellows were full of wind which he discharged into the body of the patient then withdrew the instrument to replenish it clapping his thumb strongly against the orifice of the fundament and this being repeated three or four times the adventitious wind would rush out bringing the noxious along with it like water put into pump and the patient recover saw him try both experiments upon dog but could not discern any effect from the former after the latter the animal was ready to burst and made so violent discharge as was very offensive to me and my companions the dog died on the spot and we left the doctor endeavoring to recover him by the same operation visited many other apartments but shall not trouble my reader with all the curiosities observed being studious of brevity had hitherto seen only one side of the academy the other being appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning of which shall say something when have mentioned one illustrious person more who is called among them the universal artist he told us he had been thirty years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life he had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and fifty men at work some were condensing air into dry tangible substance by extracting the nitre and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate others softening marbles for pillows and pincushions others petrifying the hoofs of living horse to preserve them from foundering the artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs the first to sow land with chaff wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained as he demonstrated by several experiments which was not skillful enough to comprehend the other was by certain composition of gums minerals and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs and he hoped in reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom we crossed walk to the other part of the academy where as have already said the projectors in speculative learning resided the first professor saw was in very large room with forty pupils about him after salutation observing me to look earnestly upon frame which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the room he said perhaps might wonder to see him employed in project for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical operations but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness and he flattered himself that more noble exalted thought never sprang in any other man head everyone knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the most ignorant person at reasonable charge and with little bodily labor may write books in philosophy poetry politics law mathematics and theology without the least assistance from genius or study he then led me to the frame about the sides whereof all his pupils stood in ranks it was twenty feet square placed in the middle of the room the superficies was composed of several bits of wood about the bigness of die but some larger than others they were all linked together by slender wires these bits of wood were covered on every square with paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of their language in their several moods tenses and declensions but without any order the professor then desired me to observe for he was going to set his engine at work the pupils at his command took each of them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame and giving them sudden turn the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed he then commanded thirtysix of the lads to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the frame and where they found three or four words together that might make part of sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who were scribes this work was repeated three or four times and at every turn the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places as the square bits of wood moved upside down p3ch5 paragraph 15 six hours day the young students were employed in this labor and the professor showed me several volumes in large folio already collected of broken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of those rich materials to give the world complete body of all arts and sciences which however might be still improved and much expedited if the public would raise fund for making and employing five hundred such frames in lagado and oblige the managers to contribute in common their several collections see plate he assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his youth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame and made the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books between the numbers of particles nouns and verbs and other parts of speech made my humblest acknowledgement to this illustrious person for his great communicativeness and promised if ever had the good fortune to return to my native country that would do him justice as the sole inventor of this wonderful machine the form and contrivance of which desired leave to delineate upon paper as in the figure here annexed told him although it were the custom of our learned in europe to steal inventions from each other who had thereby at least this advantage that it became controversy which was the right owner yet would take such caution that he should have the honor entire without rival we next went to the school of languages where three professors sat in consultation upon improving that of their own country p3ch5 paragraph 20 the first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables into one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality all things imaginable are but nouns the other project was scheme for entirely abolishing all words whatsoever and this was urged as great advantage in point of health as well as brevity for it is plain that every word we speak is in some degree diminution of our lungs by corrosion and consequently contributes to the shortening of our lives an expedient was therefore offered that since words are only names for things it would be more convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary to express the particular business they are to discourse on and this invention would certainly have taken place to the great ease as well as health of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate had not threatened to raise rebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner of their ancestors such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people however many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things which has only this inconvenience attending it that if man business be very great and of various kinds he must be obliged in proportion to carry greater bundle of things upon his back unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when they met in the streets would lay down their loads open their sacks and hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements help each other to resume their burdens and take their leave but for short conversations man may carry implements in his pockets and under his arms enough to supply him and in his house he can not be at loss therefore the room where company meet who practise this art is full of all things ready at hand requisite to furnish matter for this kind of artificial converse another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would serve as universal language to be understood in all civilized nations whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearly resembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended and thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes or ministers of state to whose tongues they were utter strangers was at the mathematical school where the master taught his pupils after method scarce imaginable to us in europe the proposition and demonstration were fairly written on thin wafer with ink composed of cephalic tincture this the student was to swallow upon fasting stomach and for three days following eat nothing but bread and water as the wafer digested the tincture mounted to his brain bearing the proposition along with it but the success has not hitherto been answerable partly by some error in the quantum or composition and partly by the perverseness of lads to whom this bolus is so nauseous that they generally steal aside and discharge it upwards before it can operate neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an abstinence as the prescription required p3ch6 chapter vi in the school of political projectors was but ill entertained the professors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses which is scene that never fails to make me melancholy these unhappy people were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favorites upon the score of their wisdom capacity and virtue of teaching ministers to consult the public good of rewarding merit great abilities eminent services of instructing princes to know their true interest by placing it on the same foundation with that of their people of choosing for employments persons qualified to exercise them with many other wild impossible chimeras that never entered before into the heart of man to conceive and confirmed in me the old observation that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational which some philosophers have not maintained for truth but however shall so far do justice to this part of the academy as to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary there was most ingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature and system of government this illustrious person had very usefully employed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are subject by the vices or infirmities of those who govern as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey for instance whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed that there is strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political body can there be anything more evident than that the health of both must be preserved and the cured by the same prescriptions it is allowed that senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant ebullient and other peccant humors with many diseases of the head and more of the heart with strong convulsions with grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands but especially the right with spleen flatus vertigos and deliriums with scrofulous tumors full of fetid purulent matter with sour frothy ructations with canine appetites and crudeness of digestion besides many others needless to mention this doctor therefore proposed that upon the meeting of senate certain physicians should attend at the three first days of their sitting and at the close of each day debate feel the pulses of every senator after which having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the several maladies and the methods of cure they should on the fourth day return to the senate house attended by their apothecaries stored with proper medicines and before the members sat administer to each of them lenitives aperitives abstersives corrosives restringents palliatives laxatives cephalalgics icterics apophlegmatics acoustics as their several cases required and according as these medicines should operate repeat alter or omit them at the next meeting this project could not be of any great expense to the public and would in my poor opinion be of much use for the dispatch of business in those countries where senates have any share in the legislative power beget unanimity shorten debates open few mouths which are now closed and close many more which are now open curb the petulancy of the young and correct the positiveness of the old rouse the stupid and damp the pert again because it is general complaint that the favorites of princes are troubled with short and weak memories the same doctor proposed that whoever attended first minister after having told his business with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words should at his departure give the said minister tweak by the nose or kick in the belly or tread on his corns or lug him thrice by both ears or pin into his breech or pinch his arm black and blue to prevent forgetfulness and at every levee day repeat the same operation till the business were done or absolutely refused he likewise directed that every senator in the great council of nation after he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defense of it should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary because if that were done the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the public p3ch6 paragraph when parties in state are violent he offered wonderful contrivance to reconcile them the method is this you take hundred leaders of each party you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest of size then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple at the same time in such manner that the brain may be equally divided let the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged applying each to the head of his opposite partyman it seems indeed to be work that requires some exactness but the professor assured us that if it were dexterously performed the cure would be infallible for he argued thus that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between themselves within the space of one skull would soon come to good understanding and produce that moderation as well as regularity of thinking so much to be wished for in the heads of those who imagine they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion and as to the difference of brains in quantity or quality among those who are directors in faction the doctor assured us from his own knowledge that it was perfect trifle heard very warm debate between two professors about the most commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without grieving the subject the first affirmed the most just method would be to lay certain tax upon vices and folly and the sum fixed upon every man to be rated after the fairest manner by jury of his neighbors the second was of an opinion directly contrary to tax those qualities of body and mind for which men chiefly value themselves the rate to be more or less according to the degrees of excelling the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own breast the highest tax was upon men who are the greatest favorites of the other sex and the assessments according to the number and natures of the favors they have received for which they are allowed to be their own vouchers wit valor and politeness were likewise proposed to be largely taxed and collected in the same manner by every person giving his own word for the quantum of what he possessed but as to honor justice wisdom and learning they should not be taxed at all because they are qualifications of so singular kind that no man will either allow them in his neighbor or value them in himself the women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill in dressing wherein they had the same privilege with the men to be determined by their own judgment but constancy chastity good sense and good nature were not rated because they would not bear the charge of collecting to keep senators in the interest of the crown it was proposed that the members should raffle for employments every man first taking an oath and giving security that he would vote for the court whether he won or not after which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raising upon the next vacancy thus hope and expectation would be kept alive none would complain of broken promises but impute their disappointments wholly to fortune whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of ministry another professor showed me large paper of instructions for discovering plots and conspiracies against the government he advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times of eating upon which side they lay in bed with which hand they wiped their posteriors to take strict view of their excrements and from the color the odor the taste the consistence the crudeness of maturity of digestion form judgment of their thoughts and designs because men are never so serious thoughtful and intent as when they are at stool which he found by frequent experiment for in such conjunctures when he used merely as trial to consider which was the best way of murdering the king his ordure would have tincture of green but quite different when he thought only of raising an insurrection or burning the metropolis p3ch6 paragraph 10 the whole discourse was written with great acuteness containing many observations both curious and useful for politicians but as conceived not altogether complete this ventured to tell the author and offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions he received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers especially those of the projecting species professing he would be glad to receive further information told him that in the kingdom of tribnia by the natives called langden where had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk of the people consist in manner wholly of discoverers witnesses informers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the colors and conduct of ministers of state and their deputies the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound politicians to restore new vigor to crazy administration to stifle or divert general discontents to fill their pockets with forfeitures and raise or sink the opinion of public credit as either shall best answer their private advantage it is first agreed and settled among them what suspected persons shall be accused of plot then effectual care is taken to secure all their letters and papers and put the criminals in chains these papers are delivered to set of artists very dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words syllables and letters for instance they can discover closestool to signify privy council flock of geese senate lame dog an invader codshead the plague standing army buzzard prime minister the gout high priest gibbet secretary of state chamberpot committee of grandees sieve court lady broom revolution mousetrap an employment bottomless pit the treasury sink the court capand bells favorite broken reed court of justice an empty tun general running sore the administration when this method fails they have two others more effectual which the learned among them call acrostics and anagrams first they can decipher all initial letters into political meanings thus shall signify plot regiment of horse fleet at sea or secondly by transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper they can discover the deepest designs of discontented party so for example if should say in letter to friend our brother tom has just got the piles skillful decipherer would discover that the same letters which compose that sentence may be analyzed into the following words resist plot is brought home the tour and this is the anagrammatic method the professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these observations and promised to make honorable mention of me in his treatise saw nothing in this country that could invite me to longer continuance and began to think of returning home to england p3ch7 chapter vii the continent of which this kingdom is part extends itself as have reason to believe eastward to that unknown tract of america westward to california and north to the pacific ocean which is not above hundred and fifty miles from lagado where there is good port and much commerce with the great island of luggnagg situated to the northwest about 29 degrees north latitude and 140 longitude the island of luggnagg stands southeastward of japan about hundred leagues distant there is strict alliance between the japanese emperor and the king of luggnagg which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the other determined therefore to direct my course this way in order to my return to europe hired two mules with guide to show me the way and carry my small baggage took leave of my noble protector who had shown me so much favor and made me generous present at my departure my journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating when arrived at the port of maldonada for so it is called there was no ship in the harbor bound for luggnagg nor likely to be in some time the town is about as large as portsmouth soon fell into some acquaintance and was very hospitably received gentleman of distinction said to me that since the ships bound for luggnagg could not be ready in less than month it might be no disagreeable amusement for me to take trip to the little island of glubbdubdrib about five leagues off to the southwest he offered himself and friend to accompany me and that should be provided with small convenient barque for the voyage glubbdubdrib as nearly as can interpret the word signifies the island of sorcerers or magicians it is about onethird as large as the isle of wight and extremely fruitful it is governed by the head of certain tribe who are all magicians this tribe marries only among each other and the eldest in succession is prince or governor he has noble palace and park of about three thousand acres surrounded by wall of hewn stone twenty feet high in this park are several small enclosures for cattle corn and gardening the governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of kind somewhat unusual by his skill in necromancy he has power of calling whom he pleases from the dead and commanding their service for twentyfour hours but no longer nor can he call the same persons up again in less than three months except upon very extraordinary occasions when we arrived at the island which was about eleven in the morning one of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desired admittance for stranger who came on purpose to have the honor of attending on his highness this was immediately granted and we all three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards armed and dressed after very antic manner and something in their countenances that made my flesh creep horror can not express we passed through several apartments between servants of the same sort ranked on each side as before till we came to the chamber of presence where after three profound obeisances and few general questions we were permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of his highness throne he understood the language of balnibarbi although it were different from that of his island he desired me to give him some account of my travels and to let me see that should be treated without ceremony he dismissed all his attendants with turn of his finger at which to my great astonishment they vanished in an instant like visions in dream when we awake on sudden could not recover myself in some time till the governor assured me that should receive no hurt and observing my two companions to be under no concern who had been often entertained in the same manner began to take courage and related to his highness short history of my several adventures yet not without some hesitation and frequently looking behind me to the place where had seen those domestic specters had the honor to dine with the governor where new set of ghosts served up the meat and waited at table now observed myself to be less terrified than had been in the morning stayed till sunset but humbly desired his highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace my two friends and lay at private house in the town adjoining which is the capital of this little island and the next morning we returned to pay our duty to the governor as he was pleased to command us p3ch7 paragraph after this manner we continued in the island for ten days most part of every day with the governor and at night in our lodging soon grew so familiarized to the sight of spirits that the third or fourth time they gave me no emotion at all or if had any apprehensions left my curiosity prevailed over them for his highness the governor ordered me to call up whatever persons would choose to name and in whatever numbers among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the present time and command them to answer any questions should think fit to ask with this condition that my questions must be confined within the compass of the times they lived in and one thing might depend upon that they would certainly tell me truth for lying was talent of no use in the lower world made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great favor we were in chamber from whence there was fair prospect into the park and because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes of pomp and magnificence desired to see alexander the great at the head of his army just after the battle of arbela which upon notion of the governor finger immediately appeared in large field under the window where we stood alexander was called up into the room it was with great difficulty that understood his greek and had but little of my own he assured me upon his honor that he was not poisoned but died of fever by excessive drinking next saw hannibal passing the alps who told me he had not drop of vinegar in his camp saw caesar and pompey at the head of their troops just ready to engage saw the former in his last great triumph desired that the senate of rome might appear before me in one large chamber and an assembly of somewhat latter age in counterview in another the first seemed to be an assembly of heroes and demigods the other knot of pedlars pickpockets highwaymen and bullies the governor at my request gave the sign for caesar and brutus to advance towards us was struck with profound veneration at the sight of brutus and could easily discover the most consummate virtue the greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind the truest love of his country and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of his countenance observed with much pleasure that these two persons were in good intelligence with each other and caesar freely confessed to me that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by many degrees to the glory of taking it away had the honor to have much conversation with brutus and was told that his ancestor junius socrates epaminondas cato the younger sir thomas more and himself were perpetually together sextumvirate to which all the ages of the world can not add seventh p3ch7 paragraph 10 it would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me chiefly fed my eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and usurpers and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations but it is impossible to express the satisfaction received in my own mind after such manner as to make it suitable entertainment to the reader p3ch8 chapter viii having desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and learning set apart one day on purpose proposed that homer and aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court and outward rooms of the palace knew and could distinguish those two heroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each other homer was the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erect for one of his age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing ever beheld aristotle stooped much and made use of staff his visage was meager his hair lank and thin and his voice hollow soon discovered that both of were perfect strangers to the rest of the company and had never seen or heard of them before and had whisper from ghost who shall be nameless that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals in the lower world through consciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity introduced didymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted genius to enter into the spirit of poet but aristotle was out of all patience with the account gave him of scotus and ramus as presented them to him and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves then desired the governor to call up descartes and gassendi with whom prevailed to explain their systems to aristotle this great philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture as all men must do and he found that gassendi who had made the doctrine of epicurus as palatable as he could and the vortices of descartes were equally exploded he predicted the same fate to attraction whereof the present learned are such zealous asserters he said that new systems of nature were but new fashions which would vary in every age and even those who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles would flourish but short period of time and be out of vogue when that was determined spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned saw most of the first roman emperors prevailed on the governor to call up eliogabalus cooks to dress us dinner but they could not show us much of their skill for want of materials helot of agesilaus made us dish of spartan broth but was not able to get down second spoonful the two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by their private affairs to return in three days which employed in seeing some of the modern dead who had made the greatest figure for two or three hundred years past in our own and other countries of europe and having been always great admirer of old illustrious families desired the governor call up dozen or two of kings with their ancestors in order for eight or nine generations but my disappointment was grevious and unexpected for instead of long train with royal diadems saw in one family two fiddlers three spruce courtiers and an italian prelate in another barber an abbot and two cardinals have too great veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice subject but as to counts marquesses dukes earls and the like was not so scrupulous and confess it was not without some pleasure that found myself able to trace the particular features by which certain families are distinguished up to their originals could plainly discover from whence one family derives long chin why second has abounded with knaves for two generations and fools for two more why third happened to be crackbrained and fourth to be sharpers whence it came what polydore virgil says of certain great house nec vir fortis nec femina casta how cruelty falsehood and cowardice grew to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much as by their coat of arms who first brought the pox into noble house which has lineally descended in scrofulous tumors to their posterity neither could wonder at all this when saw such an interruption of lineages by pages lackeys valets coachmen gamesters captains and pickpockets was chiefly disgusted with modern history for having strictly examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for hundred years past found how the world had been misled by prostitute writers to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards the wisest counsel to fools sincerity to flatterers roman virtue to betrayers of their country piety to atheists chastity to sodomites informers how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the corruption of judges and the malice of factions how many villains had been exalted to the highest places of trust power dignity and profit how great share in the motions and events of courts councils and senates might be challenged by bawds whores pimps parasites and buffoons how low an opinion had of human wisdom and integrity when was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world and of the contemptible accidents to which they owed their success p3ch8 paragraph here discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write anecdotes or secret history who send so many kings to their graves with cup of poison will repeat the discourse between prince and chief minister where no witness was by unlock the thoughts and cabinets of ambassadors and secretaries of state and have the perpetual misfortune to be mistaken here discovered the secret causes of many great events that have surprised the world how whore can govern the backstairs the backstairs council and the council senate general confessed in my presence that he got victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct and an admiral that for want of proper intelligence he beat the enemy to whom he intended to betray the fleet three kings protested to me that in their whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of merit unless by mistake or treachery of some minister in whom they confided neither would they do it if they were to live again and they showed with great strength of reason that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption because that positive confident restive temper which virtue infused into man was perpetual clog to public business had the curiosity to enquire in particular manner by what method great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honor and prodigious estates and confined my inquiry to very modern period however without grating upon present times because would be sure to give no offense even to foreigners for hope the reader need not be told that do not in the least intend my own country in what say upon this occasion great number of persons concerned were called up and upon very slight examination discovered such scene of infamy that can not reflect upon it without some seriousness perjury oppression subornation fraud panderism and the like infirmities were amongst the most excusable arts they had to mention and for these gave as it was reasonable great allowance but when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betraying of their country or their prince some to poisoning more to the perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent hope may be pardoned if these discoveries inclined me little to abate of that profound veneration which am naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity by us their inferiors had often read of some great services done to princes and states and desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed upon inquiry was told that their names were to be found on no record except few of them whom history has represented as the vilest rogues and traitors as to the rest had never once heard of them they all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest habit most of them telling me they died in poverty and disgrace and the rest on scaffold or gibbet among the rest there was one person whose case appeared little singular he had youth about eighteen years old standing by his side he told me he had for many years been commander of ship and in the sea fight of actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy great line of battle sink three of their capital ships and take fourth which was the sole cause of antony flight and of the victory that ensued that the youth standing by him his only son was killed in action he added that upon the confidence of some merit the war being at an end he went to rome and solicited at the court of augustus to be preferred to greater ship whose commander had been killed but without any regard to his pretensions it was given to youth who had never seen the sea the son of libertine who waited on one of the emperor mistresses returning back to his own vessel he was charged with neglect of duty and the ship given to favorite page of publicola the viceadmiral whereupon he retired to poor farm at great distance from rome and there ended his life was so curious to know the truth of this story that desired agrippa might be called who was admiral in that fight he appeared and confirmed the whole account but with much more advantage to the captain whose modesty had extenuated or concealed great part of his merit was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that empire by the force of luxury so lately introduced which made me less wonder at many parallel cases in other countries where vices of all kinds have reigned so much longer and where the whole praise as well as pillage has been engrossed by the chief commander who perhaps had the least title to either p3ch8 paragraph 10 as every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in the world it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race of human kind was degenerate among us within these hundred years past how the pox under all its consequences and denominations had altered every lineament of an english countenance shortened the size of bodies unbraced the nerves relaxed the sinews and muscles introduced sallow complexion and rendered the flesh loose and rancid descended so low as to desire that some english yeomen of the old stamp might be summoned to appear once so famous for the simplicity of their manners diet and dress for justice in their dealings for their true spirit of liberty for their valor and love of their country neither could be wholly unmoved after comparing the living with the dead when considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for piece of money by their grandchildren who in selling their votes and managing at elections have acquired every vice and corruption that can possibly be learned in court p3ch9 chapter ix the day of our departure being come took leave of his highness the governor of glubbdubdrib and returned with my two companions to maldonada where after fortnight waiting ship was ready to sail for luggnagg the two gentlemen and some others were so generous and kind as to furnish me with provisions and see me on board was month in this voyage we had one violent storm and were under necessity of steering westward to get into the tradewind which holds for above sixty leagues on the 21st of april 1709 we sailed into the river of clumegnig which is seaport town at the southeast point of luggnagg we cast anchor within league of the town and made signal for pilot two of them came on board in less than half an hour by whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks which are very dangerous in the passage to large basin where fleet may ride in safety within cable length of the town wall some of our sailors whether out of treachery or inadvertence had informed the pilots that was stranger and traveler whereof these gave notice to custom house officer by whom was examined very strictly upon my landing this officer spoke to me in the language of balnibarbi which by the force of much commerce is generally understood in that town especially by seamen and those employed in the customs gave him short account of some particulars and made my story as plausible and consistent as could but thought it necessary to disguise my country and call myself an hollander because my intentions were for japan and knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted to enter into that kingdom therefore told the officer that having been shipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi and cast on rock was received up into laputa or the flying island of which he had often heard and was now endeavoring to get to japan from whence might find convenience of returning to my own country the officer said must be confined till he could receive orders from court for which he would write immediately and hoped to receive an answer in fortnight was carried to convenient lodging with sentry placed at the door however had the liberty of large garden and was treated with humanity enough being maintained all the time at the king charge was visited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it was reported that came from countries very remote of which they had never heard hired young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter he was native of luggnagg but had lived some years at maldonada and was perfect master of both languages by his assistance was able to hold conversation with those who came to visit me but this consisted only of their questions and my answers the dispatch came from court about the time we expected it contained warrant for conducting me and my retinue to traldragdubb or trildrogdrib for it is pronounced both ways as near as can remember by party of ten horse all my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter whom persuaded into my service and at my humble request we had each of us mule to ride on messenger was dispatched half day journey before us to give the king notice of my approach and to desire that his majesty would please appoint day and hour when it would be his gracious pleasure that might have the honor to lick the dust before his footstool this is the court style and found it to be more than matter of form for upon my admittance two days after my arrival was commanded to crawl on my belly and lick the floor as advanced but on account of my being stranger care was taken to have it made so clean that the dust was not offensive however this was peculiar grace not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank when they desire an admittance nay sometimes the floor is strewn with dust on purpose when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court and have seen great lord with his mouth so crammed that when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne he was not able to speak word neither is there any remedy because it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty presence there is indeed another custom which can not altogether approve of when the king has mind to put any of his nobles to death in gentle indulgent manner he commands to have the floor strewn with certain brown powder of deadly composition which being licked up infallibly kills him in twentyfour hours but in justice to this prince great clemency and the care he has of his subject lives wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of europe would imitate him it must be mentioned for his honor that strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well after every such execution which if his domestics neglect they are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure myself heard him give directions that one of his pages should be whipped whose turn it was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution but maliciously had omitted it by which neglect young lord of great hopes coming to an audience was unfortunately poisoned although the king at that time had not design against his life but this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping upon promise that he would do so no more without special orders to return from this digression when had crept within four yards of the throne raised myself gently upon my knees and then striking my forehead seven times on the ground pronounced the following words as they had been taught me the night before ickpling gloffthrobb squutserumm blhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkguffh slhiophad gurdlubh asht this is the compliment established by the laws of the land for all persons admitted to the king presence it may be rendered into english thus may your celestial majesty outlive the sun eleven moons and half to this the king returned some answer which although could not understand yet replied as had been directed fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush which properly signifies my tongue is in the mouth of my friend and by this expression was meant that desired leave to bring my interpreter whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly introduced by whose intervention answered as many questions as his majesty could put in over an hour spoke in the balnibarbian tongue and my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of luggnagg p3ch9 paragraph the king was much delighted with my company and ordered his bliffmarklub or high chamberlain to appoint lodging in the court for me and my interpreter with daily allowance for my table and large purse of gold for my common expenses stayed three months in this country out of perfect obedience to his majesty who was pleased highly to favor me and made me very honorable offers but thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family p3ch10 chapter the luggnaggians are polite and generous people and although they are not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all eastern countries yet they show themselves courteous to strangers especially such who are countenanced by the court had many acquaintance among persons of the best fashion and being always attended by my interpreter the conversation we had was not disagreeable one day in much good company was asked by person of quality whether had seen any of their struldbrugs or immortals said had not and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an appellation applied to mortal creature he told me that sometimes though very rarely child happened to be born in family with red circular spot in the forehead directly over the left eyebrow which was an infallible mark that it should never die the spot as he described it was about the compass of silver threepence but in the course of time grew larger and changed its color for at twelve years old it became green so continued till twentyfive then turned to deep blue at fortyfive it grew coal black and as large as an english shilling but never admitted any further alteration he said these births were so rare that he did not believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis and among the rest young girl born about three years ago that these productions were not peculiar to any family but mere effect of chance and the children of the struldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight upon hearing this account and the person who gave it me happening to understand the balnibarbian language which spoke very well could not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps little too extravagant cried out as in rapture happy nation where every child hath at least chance for being immortal happy people who enjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue and have masters ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages but happiest beyond all comparison are those excellent struldbrugs who being born exempt from that universal calamity of human nature have their minds free and disengaged without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the continual apprehension of death discovered my admiration that had not observed any of these illustrious persons at court the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable distinction that could not have easily overlooked and it was impossible that his majesty most judicious prince should not provide himself with good number of such wise and able counselors yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of court and we often find by experience that young men are too opinionative and volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors however since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person was resolved upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him on this matter freely and at large by the help of my interpreter and whether he would please to take my advice or not yet in one thing was determined that his majesty having frequently offered me an establishment in this country would with great thankfulness accept the favor and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior beings the struldbrugs if they would please to admit me the gentleman to whom addressed my discourse because as have already observed he spoke the language of balnibarbi said to me with sort of smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant that he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them and desired my permission to explain to the company what had spoke he did so and they talked together for some time in their own language whereof understood not syllable neither could observe by their countenances what impression my discourse had made on them after short silence the same person told me that his friends and mine so he thought fit to express himself were very much pleased with the judicious remarks had made on the great happiness and advantages of immortal life and they were desirous to know in particular manner what scheme of living should have formed to myself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born struldbrug answered it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful subject especially to me who have been often apt to amuse myself with visions of what should do if were king general or great lord and upon this very case had frequently run over the whole system how should employ myself and pass the time if were sure to live for ever p3ch10 paragraph that if it had been my good fortune to come into the world struldbrug as soon as could discover my own happiness by understanding the difference between life and death would first resolve by an arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself riches in the pursuit of which by thrift and management might reasonably expect in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom in the second place would from my earliest youth apply myself to the study of arts and sciences by which should arrive in time to excell all others in learning lastly would carefully record every action and event of consequence that happened in the public impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and great ministers of state with my own observations on every point would exactly set down the several changes in customs language fashions of dress diet and diversions by all which acquirements should be living treasury of knowledge and wisdom and certainly become the oracle of the nation would never marry after threescore but live in an hospitable manner yet still on the saving side would entertain myself in forming and directing the minds of hopeful young men by convincing them from my own remembrance experience and observation fortified by numerous examples of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life but my choice and constant companions should be set of my own immortal brotherhood among whom would elect dozen from the most ancient down to my own contemporaries where any of these wanted fortunes would provide them with convenient lodges round my own estate and have some of them always at my table only mingling few of the most valuable among you mortals whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance and treat your posterity after the same manner just as man diverts himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year these struldbrugs and would mutually communicate our observations and memorials through the course of time remark the several gradations by which corruption steals into the world and oppose it in every step by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind which added to the strong influence of our own example would probably prevent that continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages add to all this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states and empires the changes in the lower and upper world ancient cities in ruins and obscure villages become the seats of kings famous rivers lessening into shallow brooks the ocean leaving one coast dry and overwhelming another the discovery of many countries yet unknown barbarity overrunning the politest nations and the most barbarous become civilized should then see the discovery of the longitude the perpetual motion the universal medicine and many other great inventions brought to the utmost perfection what wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy by outliving and confirming our own predictions by observing the progress and returns of comets with the changes of motion in the sun moon and stars p3ch10 paragraph 10 enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endless life and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with when had ended and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before to the rest of the company there was good deal of talk among them the language of the country not without some laughter at my expense at last the same gentleman who had been my interpreter said he was desired by the rest to set me right in few mistakes which had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature and upon that allowance was less answerable for them that this breed of struldbrugs was peculiar to their country for there were no such people either in balnibarbi or japan where he had the honor to be ambassador from his majesty and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible and it appeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me that received it as thing wholly new and scarcely to be credited that in the two kingdoms above mentioned where during his residence he had conversed very much he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind that whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he could that the oldest had still hopes of living one day longer and looked on death as the greatest evil from which nature always prompted him to retreat only in this island of luggnagg the appetite for living was not so eager from the continual example of the struldbrugs before their eyes that the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust because it supposed perpetuity of youth health and vigor which no man could be so foolish to hope however extravagant he may be in his wishes that the question therefore was not whether man would choose to be always in the prime of youth attended with prosperity and health but how he would pass perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages which old age brings along with it for although few men will avow their desires of being immortal upon such hard conditions yet in the two kingdoms before mentioned of balnibarbi and japan he observed that every man desired to put off death for some time longer let it approach ever so late and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly except he were incited by the extremity of grief or torture and he appealed to me whether in those countries had traveled as well as my own had not observed the same general disposition after this preface he gave me particular account of the struldbrugs among them he said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty years old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejected increasing in both till they came to fourscore this he learned from their own confession for otherwise there not being above two or three of that species born in an age they were too few to form general observation by when they came to fourscore years which is reckoned the extremity of living in this country they had not only all the follies and infirmities of other old men but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying they were not only opinionative peevish covetous morose vain talkative but uncapable of friendship and dead to all natural affection which never descended below their grandchildren envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions but those objects against which their envy principally directed are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old by reflecting on the former they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure and whenever they see funeral they lament and repine that others have gone to harbor of rest to which they themselves never can hope to arrive they have no remembrance of anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and middle age and even that is very imperfect and for the truth or particulars of any fact it is safer to depend on common traditions than upon their best recollections the least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage and entirely lose their memories these meet with more pity and assistance because they want many bad qualities which abound in others if struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind the marriage is dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as the younger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it reasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without any fault of their own to perpetual continuance in the world should not have their misery doubled by the load of wife as soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are looked on as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their estates only small pittance is reserved for their support and the poor ones are maintained at the public charge after that period they are held incapable of any employment of trust or profit they can not purchase lands or take leases neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any cause either civil or criminal not even for the decision of meers and bounds p3ch10 paragraph 15 at ninety they lose their teeth and hair they have at that age no distinction of taste but eat and drink whatever they can get without relish or appetite the diseases they were subject to still continue without increasing or diminishing in talking they forget the common appellation of things and the names of persons even of those who are their nearest friends and relations for the same reason they never can amuse themselves with reading because their memory will not serve to carry them from the beginning of sentence to the end and by this defect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might otherwise be capable the language of this country being always upon the flux the struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither are they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation farther than by few general words with their neighbors the mortals and thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own country this was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as can remember afterwards saw five or six of different ages the youngest not above two hundred years old who were brought to me at several times by some of my friends but although they were told that was great traveler and had seen all the world they had not the least curiosity to ask me question only desired would give them slumskudask or token of remembrance which is modest way of begging to avoid the law that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by the public although indeed with very scanty allowance they are despised and hated by all sorts of people when one of them is born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded very particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the registry which however hath not been kept above thousand years past or at least hath been destroyed by time or public disturbances but the usual way of computing how old they are is by asking them what kings or great persons they can remember and then consulting history for infallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were fourscore years old they were the most mortifying sight ever beheld and the women more horrible than the men besides the usual deformities in extreme old age they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their number of years which is not to be described and among half dozen soon distinguished which was the eldest although there were not above century or two between them p3ch10 paragraph 20 the reader will easily believe that from what had heard and seen my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions had formed and thought no tyrant could invent death into which would not run with pleasure from such life the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends upon this occasion and rallied me very pleasantly wishing would send couple of struldbrugs to my own country to arm our people against the fear of death but this it seems is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom or else should have been well content with the trouble and expense of transporting them could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relating to the struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the like circumstances otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequent of old age those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole nation and engross the civil power which for want of abilities to manage must end in the ruin of the public p3ch11 chapter xi thought this account of the struldbrugs might be some entertainment to the reader because it seems to be little out of the common way at least do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that has come to my hands and if am deceived my excuse must be that it is necessary for travelers who describe the same country very often to agree in dwelling on the same particulars without deserving the censure of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them there is indeed perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great empire of japan and it is very probable that the japanese authors may have given some account of the struldbrugs but my stay in japan was so short and was so entirely stranger to that language that was not qualified to make any inquiries but hope the dutch upon this notice will be curious and able enough to supply my defects his majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his court and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native country was pleased to give me his license to depart and honored me with letter of recommendation under his own hand to the emperor of japan he likewise presented me with four hundred and fortyfour large pieces of gold this nation delighting in even numbers and red diamond which sold in england for eleven hundred pounds on the 6th day of may 1709 took solemn leave of his majesty and all my friends this prince was so gracious as to order guard to conduct me glanguenstald which is royal port to the southwest part of the island in six days found vessel ready to carry me to japan and spent fifteen days in the voyage we landed at small port town called xamoschi situated on the southeast part of japan the town lies on the western point where there is narrow strait leading northward into long arm of the sea upon the northwest part of which yedo the metropolis stands at landing showed the custom house officers my letter from the king of luggnagg to his imperial majesty they knew the seal perfectly well it was as broad as the palm of my hand the impression was king lifting up lame beggar from the earth the magistrates of the town hearing of my letter received me as public minister they provided me with carriages and servants and bore my charges to yedo where was admitted to an audience and delivered my letter which was opened with great ceremony and explained to the emperor by an interpreter who then gave me notice by his majesty order that should signify my request and whatever it were it should be granted for the sake of his royal brother of luggnagg this interpreter was person employed to transact affairs with the hollanders he soon conjectured by my countenance that was european and therefore repeated his majesty commands in low dutch which he spoke perfectly well answered as had before determined that was dutch merchant shipwrecked in very remote country from whence traveled by sea and land to luggnagg and then took shipping for japan where knew my countrymen often traded and with some of these hoped to get an opportunity of returning into europe therefore most humbly entreated his royal favor to give order that should be conducted in safety to nangasac to this added another petition that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg his majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix because had been thrown into his kingdom by my misfortunes without any intention of trading when this latter petition was interpreted to the emperor he seemed little surprised and said he believed was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in this point and that he began to doubt whether was real hollander or not but rather suspected must be christian however for the reasons had offered but chiefly to gratify the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favor he would comply with the singularity of my humor but the affair must be managed with dexterity and his officers should be commanded to let me pass as it were by forgetfulness for he assured me that if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen the dutch they would cut my throat in the voyage returned my thanks by the interpreter for so unusual favor and some troops being at that time on their march to nangasac the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither with particular instructions about the business of the crucifix on the 9th day of june 1709 arrived at nangasac after very long and troublesome journey soon fell into the company of some dutch sailors belonging to the amboyna of amsterdam stout ship of 450 tons had lived long in holland pursuing my studies at leyden and spoke dutch well the seamen soon knew from whence came last they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life made up story as short and probable as could but concealed the greatest part knew many persons in holland was able to invent names for my parents whom pretended to be obscure people in the province of gelderland would have given the captain one theodorus vangrult what he pleased to ask for my voyage to holland but understanding was surgeon he was contented to take half the usual rate on condition that would serve him in the way of my calling before we took shipping was often asked by some of the crew whether had performed the ceremony above mentioned evaded the question by general answers that had satisfied the emperor and court in all particulars however malicious rogue of skipper went to an officer and pointing to me told him had not yet trampled on the crucifix but the other who had received instructions to let me pass gave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with bamboo after which was no more troubled with such questions p3ch11 paragraph nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage we sailed with fair wind to the cape of good hope where we stayed only to take in fresh water on the 10th of april we arrived safe at amsterdam having lost only three men by sickness in the voyage and fourth who fell from the foremast into the sea not far from the coast of guinea from amsterdam soon after set sail for england in small vessel belonging to that city on the 16th of april 1710 we put in at the downs landed the next morning and saw once more my native country after an absence of five years and six months complete went straight to redriff where arrived the same day at two in the afternoon and found my wife and family in good health the end of the third part part iv voyage to the houyhnhnms see plate p4ch1 chapter continued at home with my wife and children about five months in very happy condition if could have learned the lesson of knowing when was well left my poor wife big with child and accepted an advantageous offer made me to be captain of the adventure stout merchantman of 350 tons for understood navigation well and being grown weary of surgeon employment at sea which however could exercise upon occasion took skillful young man of that calling one robert purefoy into my ship we set sail from portsmouth upon the seventh day of august 1710 on the fourteenth we met with captain pocock of bristol at teneriffe who was going to the bay of campechy to cut logwood on the sixteenth he was parted from us by storm heard since my return that his ship foundered and none escaped but one cabin boy he was an honest man and good sailor but little too positive in his own opinions which was the cause of his destruction as it has been of several others for if he had followed my advice he might have been safe at home with his family at this time as well as myself had several men die in my ship of calentures so that was forced to get recruits out of barbadoes and the leeward islands where touched by the direction of the merchants who employed me which had soon too much cause to repent for found afterwards that most of them had been buccaneers had fifty hands on board and my orders were that should trade with the indians in the south sea and make what discoveries could these rogues whom had picked up debauched my other men and they all formed conspiracy to seize the ship and secure me which they did one morning rushing into my cabin and binding me hand and foot threatening to throw me overboard if offered to stir told them was their prisoner and would submit this they made me swear to do and then they unbound me only fastening one of my legs with chain near my bed and placed sentry at my door with his piece charged who was commanded to shoot me dead if attempted my liberty they sent me down victuals and drink and took the government of the ship to themselves their design was to turn pirates and plunder the spaniards which they could not do till they got more men but first they resolved to sell the goods in the ship and then go to madagascar for recruits several among them having died since my confinement they sailed many weeks and traded with the indians but knew not what course they took being kept close prisoner in my cabin and expecting nothing less than to be murdered as they often threatened me upon the ninth day of may 1711 one james welch came down to my cabin and said he had orders from the captain to set me ashore expostulated with him but in vain neither would he so much as tell me who their new captain was they forced me into the longboat letting me put on my best suit of clothes which were as good as new and small bundle of linen but no arms except my hanger and they were so civil as not to search my pockets into which conveyed what money had with some other little necessaries they rowed about league and then set me down on strand desired them to tell me what country it was they all swore they knew no more than myself but said that the captain as they called him was resolved after they had sold the lading to get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land they pushed off immediately advising me to make haste for fear of being overtaken by the tide and so bade me farewell in this desolate condition advanced forward and soon got upon ground where sat down on bank to rest myself and consider what had best do when was little refreshed went up into the country resolving to deliver myself to the first savages should meet and purchase my life from them by some bracelets glass rings and other toys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages and whereof had some about me the land was divided by long rows of trees not regularly planted but naturally growing there was plenty of grass and several fields of oats walked very circumspectly for fear of being surprised or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind or on either side fell into beaten road where saw many tracks of human feet and some of cows but most of horses at last beheld several animals in field and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees their shape was very singular and deformed which little discomposed me so that lay down behind thicket to observe them better some of them coming forward near the place where lay gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form their heads and breasts were covered with thick hair some frizzled and others lank they had beards like goats and long ridge of hair down their backs and the foreparts of their legs and feet but the rest of their bodies were bare so that might see their skins which were of brown buff color they had no tails nor any hair at all on their buttocks except about the anus which presume nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the ground for this posture they used as well as lying down and often stood on their hind feet they climbed high trees as nimbly as squirrel for they had strong extended claws before and behind terminating in sharp points and hooked they would often spring and bound and leap with prodigious agility the females were not so large as the males they had long lank hair on their heads but none on their faces nor anything more than sort of down on the rest of their bodies except about the anus and pudenda their dugs hung between their forefeet and often reached almost to the ground as they walked the hair of both sexes was of several colors brown red black and yellow upon the whole never beheld in all my travels so disagreeable an animal nor one against which naturally conceived so strong an antipathy so that thinking had seen enough full of contempt and aversion got up and pursued the beaten road hoping it might direct me to the cabin of some indian had not got far when met one of these creatures full in my way and coming up directly to me the ugly monster when he saw me distorted several ways every feature of his visage and stared as at an object he had never seen before then approaching nearer lifted up his forepaw whether out of curiosity or mischief could not tell but drew my hanger and gave him good blow with the flat side of it for dare not strike him with the edge fearing the inhabitants might be provoked against me if they should come to know that had killed or maimed any of their cattle when the beast felt the smart he drew back and roared so loud that herd of at least forty came flocking about me from the next field howling and making odious faces but ran to the body of tree and leaning my back against it kept them off by waving my hanger several of this cursed brood getting hold of the branches behind leaped up into the tree from where they began to discharge their excrements on my head however escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree but was almost stifled with the filth which fell about me on every side in the midst of this distress observed them all to run away of sudden as fast as they could at which ventured to leave the tree and pursue the road wondering what it was that could put them into this fright but looking on my left hand saw horse walking softly in the field which my persecutors having sooner discovered was the cause of their flight the horse started little when he came near me but soon recovering himself looked full in my face with manifest tokens of wonder he viewed my hands and feet walking round me several times would have pursued my journey but he placed himself directly in the way yet looking with very mild aspect never offering the least violence we stood gazing at each other for some time at last took the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with design to stroke it using the common style and whistle of jockeys when they are going to handle strange horse but this animal seeming to receive my civilities with disdain shook his head and bent his brows softly raising up his right forefoot to remove my hand then he neighed three or four times but in so different cadence that almost began to think he was speaking to himself in some language of his own p4ch1 paragraph while he and were thus employed another horse came up who applying himself to the first in very formal manner they gently struck each other right hoof before neighing several times by turns and varying the sound which seemed to be almost articulate they went some paces off as if it were to confer together walking side by side backward and forward like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight but often turning their eyes towards me as it were to watch that might not escape was amazed to see such actions and behavior in brute beasts and concluded with myself that if the inhabitants of this country were endued with proportionable degree of reason they must needs be the wisest people upon earth this thought gave me so much comfort that resolved to go forward until could discover some house or village or meet with any of the natives leaving the two horses to discourse together as they pleased but the first who was dapple gray observing me to steal off neighed after me in so expressive tone that fancied myself to understand what he meant whereupon turned back and came near him to expect his farther commands but concealing my fear as much as could for began to be in some pain how this adventure might terminate and the reader will easily believe did not much like my present situation the two horses came up close to me looking with great earnestness upon my face and hands the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right forehoof and discomposed it so much that was forced to adjust it better by taking it off and settling it again whereat both he and his companion who was brown bay appeared to be much surprised the latter felt the lappet of my coat and finding it to hang loose about me they both looked with new signs of wonder he stroked my right hand seeming to admire the softness and color but he squeezed it so hard between his hoof and his pastern that was forced to roar after which they both touched me with all possible tenderness they were under great perplexity about my shoes and stockings which they felt very often neighing to each other and using various gestures not unlike those of philosopher when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult phenomenon upon the whole the behavior of these animals was so orderly and rational so acute and judicious that at last concluded they must needs be magicians who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some design and seeing stranger the way were resolved to divert themselves with him or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of man so very different in habit feature and complexion from those who might probably live so remote climate upon the strength of this reasoning ventured to address them in the following manner gentlemen if you be conjurers as have good cause to believe you can understand any language therefore make bold to let your worships know that am poor distressed englishman driven by his misfortunes upon your coast and entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back as if he were real horse to some house or village where can be relieved in return of which favor will make you present of this knife and bracelet taking them out of my pocket the two creatures stood silent while spoke seeming to listen with great attention and when had ended they neighed frequently towards each other as if they were engaged in serious conversation plainly observed that their language expressed the passions very well and the words might with little pains be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the chinese could frequently distinguish the word yahoo which was repeated by each of them several times and although it was impossible for me to conjecture what it meant yet while the two horses were busy in conversation endeavored to practice this word upon my tongue and as soon as they were silent boldly pronounced yahoo in loud voice imitating at the same time as near as could the neighing of horse at which they were both visibly surprised and the gray repeated the same word twice as if he meant to teach me the right accent wherein spoke after him as well as could and found myself perceivably to improve every time though very far from any degree of perfection then the bay tried me with second word much harder to be pronounced but reducing it to the english orthography may be spelt thus houyhnhnm did not succeed in this so well as the former but after two or three farther trials had better fortune and they both appeared amazed at my capacity after some further discourse which then conjectured might relate to me the two friends took their leave with the same compliment of striking each other hoof and the gray made me signs that should walk before him wherein thought it prudent to comply till could find better director when offered to slacken my pace he would cry hhuun hhuun guessed his meaning and gave him to understand as well as could that was weary and not able to walk faster upon which he would stand while to let me rest p4ch2 chapter ii having traveled about three miles we came to long kind of building made of timber stuck in the ground and wattled across the roof was low and covered with straw now began to be little comforted and took out some toys which travelers usually carry for presents to the savage indians of america and other parts in hopes the people of the house would be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly the horse made me sign to go in first it was large room with smooth clay floor and rack and manger extending the whole length on one side there were three nags and two mares not eating but some of them sitting down upon their hams which very much wondered at but wondered more to see the rest employed in domestic business these seemed but ordinary cattle however this confirmed my first opinion that people who could so far civilize brute animals must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the world the gray came in just after and thereby prevented any ill treatment which the others might have given me he neighed to them several times in style of authority and received answers beyond this room there were three others reaching the length of the house to which you passed through three doors opposite to each other in the manner of vista we went through the second room towards the third here the gray walked in first beckoning me to attend waited in the second room and got ready my presents for the master and mistress of the house they were two knives three bracelets of pearl small looking glass and bead necklace the horse neighed three or four times and waited to hear some answers in human voice but heard no other returns than in the same dialect only one or two little shriller than his began to think that this house must belong to some person of great note among them because there appeared so much ceremony before could gain admittance but that man of quality should be served all by horses was beyond my comprehension feared my brain was disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes roused myself and looked about me in the room where was left alone this was furnished like the first only after more elegant manner rubbed my eyes often but the same objects still occurred pinched my arms and sides to awake myself hoping might be in dream then absolutely concluded that all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic but had no time to pursue these reflections for the gray horse came to the door and made me sign to follow him into the third room where saw very comely mare together with colt and foal sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw not unartfuuy made and perfectly neat and clean the mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat and coming up close after having nicely observed my hands and face gave me most contemptuous look then turning to the horse heard the word yahoo often repeated betwixt them the meaning of which word could not then comprehend although it were the first had learned to pronounce but was soon better informed to my everlasting mortification for the horse beckoning to me with his head and repeating the word hhuun hhuun as he did upon the road which understood was to attend him led me out into kind of court where was another building at some distance from the house here we entered and saw three of these detestable creatures whom first met after my landing feeding upon roots and the flesh of some animals which afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs and now and then cow dead by accident or discase were all tied by the neck with strong withes fastened to beam they held their food between the claws of their forefeet and tore it with their teeth the master horse ordered sorrel nag one of his servants to untie the largest of these animals and take him into the yard the beast and were brought close together and our countenances diligently compared both by master and servant who thereupon repeated several times the word yahoo my horror and astonishment are not to be described when observed in this abominable animal perfect human figure the face of it indeed was flat and broad the nose depressed the lips large and the mouth wide but these differences are common to all savage nations where the lineaments of the countenance are distorted by the natives suffering their infants to lie groveling on the earth or by carrying them on their backs nuzzling with their face against the mother shoulders the fore feet of the yahoo differed from my hands in nothing else but the length of the nails the coarseness and brownness of the palms and the hairiness on the backs there was the same resemblance between our feet with the same differences which knew very well though the horses did not because of my shoes and stockings the same in every part of our bodies except as to hairiness and color which have already described the great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses was to see the rest of my body so very different from that of yahoo for which was obliged to my clothes whereof they had no conception the sorrel nag offered me root which he held after their manner as we shall describe in its proper place between his hoof and pastern took it in my hand and having smelt it returned it to him again as civilly as could he brought out of the yahoo kennel piece of ass flesh but it smelt so offensively that turned from it with loathing he then threw it to the yahoo by whom it was greedily devoured he afterwards showed me wisp of hay and fetlock full of oats but shook my head to signify that neither of these were food for me and indeed now apprehended that must absolutely starve if did not get to some of my own species for as to those filthy yahoos although there were few greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself yet confess never saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts and the more came near them the more hateful they grew while stayed in that country this the master horse observed by my behavior and therefore sent the yahoo back to his kennel he then put his fore hoof to his mouth at which was much surprised although he did it with ease and with motion that appeared perfectly natural and made other signs to know what would eat but could not return him such an answer as he was able to apprehend and if he had understood me did not see how it was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment while we were thus engaged observed cow passing by whereupon pointed to her and expressed desire to let me go and milk her this had its effect for he led me back into the house and ordered mareservant to open room where good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels after very orderly and cleanly manner she gave me large bowl full of which drank very heartily and found myself well refreshed p4ch2 paragraph about noon saw coming towards the house kind of vehicle drawn like sledge by four yahoos there was in it an old steed who seemed to be of quality he alighted with his hind feet forward having by accident got hurt in his left fore foot he came to dine with our horse who received him with great civility they dined in the best room and had oats boiled in milk for the second course which the old horse ate warm but the rest cold their mangers were placed circular in the middle of the room and divided into several partitions round which they sat on their haunches upon bosses of straw in the middle was large rack with angles answering to every partition of the manger so that each horse and mare ate their own hay and their own mash of oats and milk with much decency and regularity the behavior of the young colt and foal appeared very modest and that of the master and mistress extremely cheerful and complaisant to their guest the gray ordered me to stand by him and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me as found by the stranger often looking on me and the frequent repetition of the word yahoo happened to wear my gloves which the master gray observing seemed perplexed discovering signs of wonder what had done to my fore feet he put his hoof three or four times to them as if he would signify that should reduce them to their former shape which presently did pulling off both my gloves and putting them into my pocket this occasioned farther talk and saw the company was pleased with my behavior whereof soon found the good effects was ordered to speak the few words understood and while they were at dinner the master taught the names for oats milk fire water and some others which could readily pronounce after him having from my youth great facility in learning languages when dinner was done the master horse took me aside and by signs and words made me understand the concern that he was in that had nothing to eat oats in their tongue are called hlunnh this word pronounced two or three times for although had refused them at first yet upon second thoughts considered that could contrive to make of them kind of bread which might be sufficient with milk to keep me alive till could make my escape to some other country and to creatures of my own species the horse immediately ordered white mareservant of his family to bring me good quantity of oats in sort of wooden tray these heated before the fire as well as could and rubbed them till the husks came off which made shift to winnow from the grain ground and beat them between two stones then took water and made them into paste or cake which toasted at the fire and ate warm with milk it was at first very insipid diet though common enough in many parts of europe but grew tolerable by time and having been often reduced to hard fare in my life this was not the first experiment had made how easily nature is satisfied and can not but observe that never had one hour sickness while stayed in this island is true sometimes made shift to catch rabbit or bird by springes made of yahoos hairs and often gathered wholesome herbs which boiled or ate as salads with my bread and now and then for rarity made little butter and drank the whey was at first at great loss for salt but custom soon reconciled the want of it and am confident that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury and was first introduced only as provocative to drink except where it is necessary for preserving of flesh in long voyages or in places remote from great markets for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man and as to myself when left this country it was great while before could endure the taste of it in anything that ate this is enough to say upon the subject of my diet wherewith other travelers fill their books as if the readers were personally concerned whether we fared well or ill however it necessary to mention this matter lest the world should think it impossible that could find sustenance for three years in such country and among such inhabitants when it grew towards evening the master horse ordered place for me to lodge in it was but six yards from the house and separated from the stable of the yahoos here got some straw and covering myself with my own clothes slept very sound but was in short time better accommodated as the reader shall know hereafter when come to treat more particularly about my way of living p4ch3 chapter iii my principal endeavor was to learn the language which my master for so shall henceforth call him and his children and every servant of his house were desirous to teach me for they looked upon it as prodigy that brute animal should discover such marks of rational creature pointed to every thing and inquired the name of it which wrote down in my journal book when was alone and corrected my bad accent by desiring those of the family to pronounce it often in this employment sorrel nag one of the under servants was ready to assist me in speaking they pronounce through the nose and throat and their language approaches nearest to the high dutch or german of any know in europe but is much more graceful and significant the emperor charles made almost the same observation when he said that if he were to speak to his horse it should be in high dutch the curiosity and impatience of my master were so great that he spent many hours of his leisure to instruct me he was convinced as he afterwards told me that must be yahoo but my teachableness civility and cleanliness astonished him which were qualities altogether so opposite to those animals he was most perplexed about my clothes reasoning sometimes with himself whether they were part of my body for never pulled them off till the family were asleep and got them on before they waked in the morning my master was eager to learn from where came how acquired those appearances of reason which discovered in all my actions and to know my story from my own mouth which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency made in learning and pronouncing their words and sentences to help my memory formed all learned into the english alphabet and wrote the words down with the translations ibis last after some time ventured to do in my master presence it cost me much trouble to explain to him what was doing for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or literature in about ten weeks time was able to understand most of his questions and in three months could give him some tolerable answers he was extremely curious to know from what part of the country came and how was taught to imitate rational creature because the yahoos whom he saw exactly resembled in my head hands and face that were only visible with some appearance of cunning and the strongest disposition to mischief were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes answered that came over the sea from far place with many others of my own kind in great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees that my companions forced me to land on this coast and then left me to shift for myself it was with some difficulty and by the help of many signs that brought him to understand me he replied that must needs be mistaken or that said the thing which was not for they have no word in their language to express lying or falsehood he knew it was impossible that there could be country beyond the sea or that parcel of brutes could move wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water he was sure no houyhnhnm alive could make such vessel nor would trust yahoos to manage it the word houyhnhnm in their tongue signifies horse and in its etymology the perfection of nature told my master that was at loss for expression but would improve as fast as could and hoped in short time should be able to tell him wonders he was pleased to direct his own mare his colt and foal and the servants of the family to take all opportunities of instructing me and every day for two or three hours he was at the same pains himself several horses and mares of quality in the neighborhood came often to our house upon the report spread of wonderful yahoo that could speak like houyhnhnm and seemed in his words and actions to discover some glimmerings of reason these delighted to converse with me they put many questions and received such answers as was able to return by all these advantages made so great progress that in five months from my arrival understood whatever was spoke and could express myself tolerably well p4ch3 paragraph the houyhnhnms who came to visit my master with the design of seeing and talking with me could hardly believe me to be right yahoo because my body had different covering from others of my kind they were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin except on my head face and hands but discovered that secret to my master upon an accident which happened about fortnight before have already told the reader that every night when the family were gone to bed it was my custom to strip and cover myself with my clothes it happened one morning early that my master sent for me by the sorrel nag who was his valet when he came was fast asleep my clothes fallen off on one side and my shirt above my waist awakened at the noise he made and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder after which he went to my master and in great fright gave him very confused account of what he had seen this presently discovered for going as soon as was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honor he asked me the meaning of what his servant had reported that was not the same thing when slept as appeared to be at other times that his valet assured him some part of me was white some yellow at least not so white and some brown had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress in order to distinguish myself as much as possible from that cursed race of yahoos but now found it in vain to do so any longer besides considered that my clothes and shoes would soon wear out which already were in declining condition and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of yahoos or other brutes whereby the whole secret would be known therefore told my master that in the country from which came those of my kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals prepared by art as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of air both hot and cold of which as to my own person would give him immediate conviction if he pleased to command me only desiring his excuse if did not expose those parts that nature taught us to conceal he said my discourse was all very strange but especially the last part for he could not understand why nature should teach us to conceal what nature had given that neither himself nor family were ashamed of any parts of their bodies but however might do as pleased whereupon first unbuttoned my coat and pulled it off did the same with my waistcoat drew off my shoes stockings and breeches let my shirt down to my waist and drew up the bottom fastening it like girdle about my middle to hide my nakedness my master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity and admiration he took up all my clothes in his pastern one piece after another and examined them diligently he then stroked my body very gently and looked round me several times after which he said it was plain must be perfect yahoo but that differed very much from the rest of my species in the softness and whiteness and smoothness of my skin my want of hair in several parts of my body the shape and shortness of my claws behind and before and my affectation of walking continually on my two hind feet he desired to see no more and gave me leave to put on my clothes again for was shuddering with cold expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of yahoo an odious animal for which had so utter hatred and contempt begged he would forbear applying that word to me and take the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to see me requested likewise that the secret of my having false covering to my body might be known to none but himself at least as long as my present clothing should last for as to what the sorrel nag his valet had observed his honor might command him to conceal it p4ch3 paragraph 10 all this my master very graciously consented to and thus the secret was kept till my clothes began to wear out which was forced to supply by several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned in the meantime he desired would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their language because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and reason than at the figure of my body whether it were covered or not adding that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which promised to tell him from thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me he brought me into all company and made them treat me with civility because as he told them privately this would put me into good humor and make me more diverting every day when waited on him beside the trouble he was at in teaching he would ask me several questions concerning myself which answered as well as could and by these means he had already received some general ideas though very imperfect it would be tedious to relate the several steps by which advanced to more regular conversation but the first account gave of myself in any order and length was to this purpose that came from very far country as already had attempted to tell him with about fifty more of my own species that we traveled upon the seas in great hollow vessel made of wood and larger than his honor house described the ship to him in the best terms could and explained by the help of my handkerchief displayed how it was driven forward by the wind that upon quarrel among us was set on shore on this coast where walked forward without knowing whither till he delivered me from the persecution of those execrable yahoos he asked me who made the ship and how it was possible that the houyhnhnms of my country would leave it to the management of brutes my answer was that dare proceed no further in my relation unless he would give me his word and honor that he would not be offended and then would tell him the wonders had so often promised he agreed and went on by assuring him that the ship was made by creatures was myself who in all the countries had traveled as well as in my own were the only governing rational animals and that upon my arrival here was as much astonished to see the houyhnhnms act like rational beings as he or his friends could be finding some marks of reason in creature he was pleased to call yahoo to which owned my resemblance in every part but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature said farther that if good fortune ever restored me to my native country to relate my travels here as resolved to do everybody would believe that said the thing which was not that invented the story out of my own head and with all possible respect to himself his family and friends and under his promise of not being offended our countrymen would hardly think it probable that houyhnhnm should be the presiding creature of nation and yahoo the brute p4ch4 chapter iv my master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his countenance because doubting or not believing are so little known in this country that the inhabitants can not tell how to behave themselves under such circumstances and remember in frequent discourses with my master concerning the nature of manhood in other parts of the world having occasion to talk of lying and false representation it was with much difficulty that he comprehended what meant although he had otherwise most acute judgment for he argued thus that the use of speech was to make us understand one another and to receive information of facts now if anyone said the thing which was not these ends were defeated because can not properly be said to understand him and am so far from receiving information that he leaves me worse than in ignorance for am led to believe thing black when it is white and short when it is long and these were all the notions he had concerning that faculty of lying so perfectly well understood among human creatures to return from this digression when asserted that the yahoos were the only governing animals in my country which my master said was altogether past his conception he desired to know whether we had houyhnhnms among us and what was their employment told him we had great numbers that in summer they grazed in the fields and in winter were kept in houses with hay and oats where yahoo servants were employed to rub their skins smooth comb their manes pick their feet serve them with food and make their beds understand you well said my master it is now very plain from all you have spoken that whatever share of reason the yahoos pretend to the houyhnhnms are your masters heartily wish our yahoos would be so tractable begged his honor would please to excuse me from proceeding any farther because was very certain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing but he insisted in commanding me to let him know the best and the worst told him he should be obeyed owned that the houyhnhnms among us whom we called horses were the most generous and comely animals we had that they excelled in strength and swiftness and when they belonged to persons of quality employed in traveling racing or drawing chariots they were treated with much kindness and till they fell into diseases or became foundered in the feet and then they were sold and used to all kind of drudgery till they died after which their skins were stripped and sold for what they were worth and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey but the common race of horses had not so good fortune being kept by farmers and carriers and other mean people who put them to great labor and fed them worse described as well as could our way of riding the shape and use of bridle saddle spur and whip of harness and wheels added that we fastened plates of certain hard substance called iron at the bottom of their feet to preserve their hoofs from being broken by the stony ways on which we often traveled my master after some expressions of great indignation wondered how we dared to venture upon houyhnhnm back for he was sure that the weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest yahoo or by lying down and rolling on his back squeeze the brute to death answered that our horses were trained up from three or four years old to the several uses we intended them for that if any of them proved intolerably vicious they were employed for carriages that they were severely beaten while they were young for any mischievous tricks that the males designed for common use of riding or draught were generally castrated about two years after their birth to take down their spirits and make them more tame and gentle that they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments but his honor would please to consider that they had not the least tincture of reason any more than the yahoos in this country it put me to the pains of many circumlocutions to give my master right idea of what spoke for their language does not abound in variety of words because their wants and passions are fewer than among us but it is impossible to represent his noble resentment at our savage treatment of the houyhnhnm race particularly after had explained the manner and use of castrating horses among us to hinder them from propagating their kind and to render them more servile he said if it were possible there could be any country where yahoos alone were endued with reason they certainly must be the governing animal because reason will in time always prevail against brutal strength but considering the frame of our bodies and especially of mine he thought no creature of equal bulk was so ill contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of life whereupon he desired to know whether those among whom lived resembled me or the yahoos of his country assured him that was as well shaped as most of my age but the younger and the females were much more soft and tender and the skins of the latter generally as white as milk he said differed indeed from other yahoos being much more cleanly and not altogether so deformed but in point of real advantage he thought differed for the worse that my nails were of no use either to my fore or hind feet as to my fore feet he could not properly call them by that name for he never observed me to walk upon them that they were too soft to bear the ground that generally went with them uncovered neither was the covering sometimes wore on them of the same shape or so strong as that on my feet behind that could not walk with any security for if either of my hind feet slipped must inevitably fall he then began to find fault with other parts of my body the flatness of my face the prominence of my nose my eyes placed directly in front so that could not look on either side without turning my that was not able to feed myself without lifting one of my fore feet to my mouth and therefore nature had placed these joints to answer that necessity he knew not what could be the use of those several clefts and divisions in my feet behind that these were too soft to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones without covering made from the skin of some other brute that my whole body wanted fence against heat cold which was forced to put on and off every day with tediousness and trouble and lastly that he observed every animal in this country naturally to abhor the yahoos whom the weaker avoided and the stronger drove from them so that supposing us to have the gift of reason he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural antipathy which every creature discovered against us nor consequently how we could tame and render them serviceable however he would as he said debate the matter no farther because he was more desirous to know my own story the country where was born and the several actions and events of my life before came here assured him how extremely desirous was that he should be satisfied on every point but doubted much whether it would be possible for me to explain myself on several subjects whereof his honor could have no conception because saw nothing in his country to which could resemble them that however would do my best and strive to express myself by similitudes humbly desiring his assistance when wanted proper words which he was pleased to promise me p4ch4 paragraph said my birth was of honest parents in an island called england which was remote from this country as many days journey as the strongest of his honor servants could travel in the annual course of the sun that was bred surgeon whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in the body got by accident or violence that my country was governed by female man whom we called queen that left it to get riches whereby might maintain myself and family when should return that in my last voyage was commander of the ship and had about fifty yahoos under me many of which died at sea and was forced to supply them by others picked out from several nations that our ship was twice in danger of being sunk the first time by great storm and the second by striking against rock here my master interposed by asking me how could persuade strangers out of different countries to venture with me after the losses had sustained and the hazards had run said they were fellows of desperate fortunes forced to fly from the places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes some were undone by lawsuits others spent all they had in drinking whoring and gaming others fled for treason many for murder theft poisoning robbery perjury forgery coining false money for committing rapes or sodomy for flying from their colors or deserting to the enemy and most of them had broken prison none of these dared return to their native countries for fear of being hanged or of starving in jail and therefore were under the necessity of seeking livelihood in other places during this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me several times had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced to fly their country this labor took up several days conversation before he was able to comprehend me he was wholly at loss to know what could be the use or necessity of practicing those vices to clear up which endeavored to give some ideas of the desire of power and riches of the terrible effects of lust intemperance malice and envy all this was forced to define and describe by putting of cases and making of suppositions after which like one whose imagination was struck with something never seen or heard of before he would lift up his eyes with amazement and indignation power government war law punishment and thousand other things had no terms wherein that language could express them which made the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master any conception of what meant but being of an excellent understanding much improved by contemplation and converse he at last arrived at competent knowledge of what human nature in our parts of the world is capable to perform and desired would give him some particular account of that land which we call europe but especially of my own country p4ch5 chapter the reader may please to observe that the following extract of many conversations had with my master contains summary of the most material points which were discoursed at several times for above two years his honor often desiring fuller satisfaction as farther improved in the houyhnhnm tongue laid before him as well as could the whole state of europe discoursed of trade and manufactures of arts and sciences and the answers gave to all the questions he made as they arose upon several subjects were fund of conversation not to be exhausted but shall here only set down the substance of what passed between us concerning my own country reducing it into order as well as can without any regard to time or other circumstances while strictly adhere to truth my only concern is that shall hardly be able to do justice to my master arguments and expressions which must needs suffer by my want of capacity as well as by translation into our barbarous english in obedience therefore to his honor commands related to him the revolution under the prince of orange the long war with france entered into by the said prince and renewed by his successor the present queen wherein the greatest powers of christendom were engaged and which still continued computed at his request that about million of yahoos might have been killed in the whole progress of it and perhaps hundred or more cities taken and thrice as many ships burnt or sunk he asked me what were the usual causes or motives that made one country go to war with another answered they were innumerable but should only mention few of the chief sometimes the ambition of princes who never think they have land or people enough to govern sometimes the corruption of ministers who engage their master in war in order to stifle or divert the clamor of the subjects against their evil administration difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives for instance whether flesh be bread or bread be flesh whether the juice of certain berry be blood or wine whether whistling be vice or virtue whether it be better to kiss post or throw it into the fire what is the best color for coat whether black white red or gray and whether it should be long or short narrow or wide dirty or clean with many more neither are any wars so furious and bloody or of so long continuance as those occasioned by difference in opinion especially if it be in things indifferent sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to which of them shall dispossess third of his dominions where neither of them pretend to any right sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the other should quarrel with him sometimes war is entered upon because the enemy is too strong and sometimes because he is too weak sometimes our neighbors want the things which we have or have the things which we want and we both fight till they take ours or give us theirs it is very justifiable cause of war to invade country after the people have been wasted by famine destroyed by pestilence or embroiled by factions among themselves it is justifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally when one of his towns lies convenient for us or territory of land that would render our dominions round and complete if prince sends forces into nation where the people are poor and ignorant he may lawfully put half of them to death and make slaves of the rest in order to civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living it is very kingly honorable and frequent practice when one prince desires the assistance of another to secure him against an invasion that the assistant when he has driven out the invader should seize on the dominions himself and kill imprison or banish the prince he came to relieve alliance by blood or marriage is frequent cause of war between princes and the nearer the kindred is the greater is their disposition to quarrel poor nations are hungry and rich nations are proud and pride and hunger will ever be at variance for these reasons the trade of soldier is held the most honorable of all others because soldier is yahoo hired to kill in cold blood as many of his own species who have never offended him as possibly he can there is likewise kind of beggarly princes in europe not able to make war by themselves who hire out their troops to richer nations for so much day to each man of which they keep threefourths to themselves and it is the best part of their maintenance such are those in germany and other northern parts of europe p4ch5 paragraph what you have told me said my master upon the subject of war does indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to however it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger and that nature has left you utterly uncapable of doing much mischief for your mouths lying flat with your faces you can hardly bite each other to any purpose unless by consent then as to the claws upon your feet before and behind they are so short and tender that one of our yahoos would drive dozen of yours before him and therefore in recounting the numbers of those who have been killed in battle can not but think that you have said the thing which is not could not forbear shaking my head and smiling little at his ignorance and being no stranger to the art of war gave him description of cannons culverins muskets carabines pistols bullets powder swords bayonets battles sieges retreats attacks undermines countermines bombardments sea fights ships sunk with thousand men twenty thousand killed on each side dying groans limbs flying in the air smoke noise confusion trampling to death under horses feet flight pursuit victory fields strewed with carcases left for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey plundering stripping ravishing burning and destroying and to set forth the valor of my own dear countrymen assured him that had seen them blow up hundred enemies at once in siege and as many in ship and beheld the dead bodies come down in pieces from the clouds to the great diversion of the spectators was going on to more particulars when my master commanded me silence he said whoever understood the nature of yahoos might easily believe it possible for so vile animals to be capable of every action had named if their strength and cunning squalled their malice but as my discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species so he found it gave him disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly stranger before he thought his ears being used to such abominable words might by degrees admit them with less detestation that although he hated the yahoos of this country yet he no more blamed them for their odious qualities than he did gnnayh bird of prey for its cruelty or sharp stone for cutting his hoof but when creature pretending to reason could be capable of such enormities he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself he seemed therefore confident that instead of reason we were only possessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices as the reflection from troubled stream returns the image of an illshapen body not only larger but more distorted he added that he had heard too much upon the subject of war both in this and some former discourses there was another point which little perplexed him at present had informed him that some of our crew left their country on account of being ruined by law that had already explained the meaning of the word but he was at loss how it should come to pass that the law which was intended for every man preservation should be any man ruin therefore he desired to be further satisfied what meant by law and the dispensers thereof according to the present practice in my own country because he thought nature and reason were sufficient guides for reasonable animal as we pretended to be in showing us what we ought to do and what to avoid p4ch5 paragraph 10 assured his honor that law was science wherein had not much conversed further than by employing advocates in vain upon some injustices that had been done me however would give him all the satisfaction was able said there was society of men among us bred up from their youth in the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose that white is black and black is white according as they are paid to this society all the rest of the people are slaves for example if my neighbor has mind to my cow he hires lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me must then hire another to defend my right it being against all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself now in this case who am the right owner lie under two great disadvantages first my lawyer being practiced almost from his cradle in defending falsehood is quite out of his element when he would be an advocate for justice which as an office unnatural he always attempts with great awkwardness if not with illwill the second disadvantage is that my lawyer must proceed with great caution or else he will be reprimanded by the judges and abhorred by his brethren as one that would lessen the practice of the law and therefore have but two methods to preserve my cow the first is to gain over my adversary lawyer with double fee who will then betray his client by insinuating that he has justice on his side the second way is for my lawyer to make my cause appear as unjust as he can by the cow to belong to my adversary and this if it be skillfully done will certainly bespeak the favor of the bench now your honour is to know that these judges an appointed to decide all controversies of property as well as for the trial of criminals and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers who are grown old or lazy and having been biassed all their lives against truth and equity are under such fatal necessity of favoring fraud perjury and oppression that have known several of them refuse large bribe from the side where justice lay rather than injure the faculty by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office it is maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before may legally be done again and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made against common justice and the general reason of mankind these under the name of precedents they produce as authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions and the judges never fail of directing accordingly in pleading they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the cause but are loud violent and tedious in dwelling upon all circumstances which are not to the purpose for instance in the case already mentioned they never desire to know what claim or title my adversary has to my cow but whether the said cow were red or black her horns long or short whether the field graze her in be round or square whether she was milked at home or abroad what diseases she is subject to and the like after which they consult precedents adjourn the cause from time to time and in ten twenty or thirty years come to an issue p4ch5 paragraph 15 it is likewise to be observed that this society has peculiar cant and jargon of their own that no other mortal can understand and wherein all their laws are written which they take special care to multiply whereby they have wholly confounded the very essence of truth and falsehood of right and wrong so that it will take thirty years to decide whether the field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me or to stranger three hundred miles off in the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state the method is much more short and commendable the judge first sends to sound the disposition of those in power after which he can easily hang or save the criminal strictly preserving all due forms of law here my master interposing said it was pity that creatures endowed with such prodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers by the description gave of them must certainly be were not rather encouraged to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge in answer to which assured his honor that in all points out of their own trade they were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation among us the most despicable in common conversation avowed enemies to all knowledge and learning and equally to pervert the general reason of mankind in every other subject of discourse as in that of their own profession p4ch6 chapter vi my master was yet wholly at loss to understand what motives could incite this race of lawyers to perplex disquiet and weary themselves and engage in confederacy of injustice merely for the sake of injuring their fellow animals neither could he comprehend what meant in saying they did it for hire whereupon was at much pains to describe to him the use of money the materials it was made of and the value of the metals that when yahoo had got great store of this precious substance he was able to purchase whatever he had mind to the finest clothing the noblest houses great tracts of land the most costly meats and drinks and have his choice of the most beautiful females therefore since money alone was able to perform all these feats our yahoos thought they could never have enough of it to spend or save as they found themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or avarice that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man labor and the latter were thousand to one in proportion to the former that the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably by laboring every day for small wages to make few live plentifully enlarged myself much on these and many other particulars to the same purpose but his honor was still to seek for he went upon supposition that all animals had title to their share in the productions of the earth and especially those who presided over the rest therefore he desired would let him know what these costly meats were and how any of us happened to want them whereupon enumerated as many sorts as came into my head with the various methods of dressing them which could not be done without sending vessels by sea to every part of the world as well for liquors to drink as for sauces and innumerable other conveniences assured him that this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better female yahoos could get her breakfast or cup to put it in he said that must needs be miserable country which can not furnish food for its own inhabitants but what he chiefly wondered at was how such vast tracts of ground as described should be wholly without fresh water and the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink replied that england the dear place of my nativity was computed to produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are able to consume as well as liquors extracted from grain or pressed out of the fruit of certain trees which made excellent drink and the same proportion in every other convenience of life but in order to feed the luxury and intemperance of the males and the vanity of the females we sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries from whence in return we brought the materials of diseases folly and vice to spend among ourselves hence it follows of necessity that vast numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging robbing stealing cheating pimping forswearing flattering suborning forging gaming lying fawning hectoring voting scribbling stargazing poisoning whoring canting libeling free thinking and the like occupations every one of which terms was at much pains to make him understand that wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the want of water or other drinks but because it was sort of liquid which made us merry by putting us out of our senses diverted all melancholy thoughts begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain raised our hopes and banished our fears suspended every office of reason for time and deprived us of the use of our limbs till we fell into profound sleep although it must be confessed that we always awoke sick and dispirited and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases which made our lives uncomfortable and short but beside all this the bulk of our people supported themselves by furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich and to each other for instance when am at home and dressed as ought to be carry on my body the workmanship of hundred tradesmen the building and furniture of my house employ as many more and five times the number to adorn my wife was going on to tell him of another sort of people who get their livelihood by attending the sick having upon some occasions informed his honor that many of my crew had died of diseases but here it was with the utmost difficulty that brought him to apprehend what meant he could easily conceive that houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy few days before his death or by some accident might hurt limb but that nature who works all things to perfection should suffer any pains to breed in our bodies he thought impossible and desired to know the reason of so unaccountable an evil told him we fed on thousand things which operated contrary to each other that we ate when we were not hungry and drank without the provocation of thirst that we sat whole nights strong liquors without eating bit which disposed us to sloth inflamed our bodies and precipitated or prevented digestion that prostitute female yahoos acquired certain malady which bred rottenness in the bones of those who fell into their embraces that this and many other diseases were propagated from father to son so that great numbers come into the world with complicated maladies upon them that it would be endless to give him catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies for they could not be fewer than five or six hundred spread over every limb and joint in short every part external and intestine having diseases appropriated to them to remedy which there was sort of people bred up among us in the profession or pretense of curing the sick and because had some skill in the faculty would in gratitude to his honor let him know the whole mystery and method by which they proceed their fundamental is that all diseases arise from repletion from which they conclude that great evacuation of the body is necessary either through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth their next business is from herbs minerals gums oils shells salts juices seaweed excrements barks of trees serpents toads frogs spiders dead men flesh and bone birds beasts and fishes to form composition for smell and taste the most abominable nauseous and detestable they can possibly contrive which the stomach immediately rejects with loathing and this they call vomit or else from the same storehouse with some other poisonous additions they command us to take in at the orifice above or below just as the physician then happens to be disposed medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the bowels which relaxing the belly drives down all before it and this they call purge or cluster for nature as the physicians allege having intended the superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and liquids and the inferior posterior for ejection these artists ingeniously considering that in all diseases nature is forced out of her seat therefore to replace her in it the body must be treated in manner directly contrary by interchanging the use of each orifice forcing solids and liquids in at the anus and making evacuations at the mouth p4ch6 paragraph but besides real diseases we are subject to many that are only imaginary for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures these have their several names and so have the drugs that are proper for them and with these our female yahoos are always infested one great excellency in this tribe is their skiff at prognostics wherein they seldom fail their predictions in real diseases when they rise to any degree of malignity generally portending death which is always in their power when recovery is not and therefore upon any unexpected signs of amendment after they have pronounced their sentence rather than be accused as false prophets they know how to approve their sagacity to the world by seasonable dose they are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown weary of their mates to eldest sons to great ministers of state and often to princes had formerly upon occasion discoursed with my master upon the nature of government in general and particularly of our own excellent constitution deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world but having here accidentally mentioned minister of state he commanded me some time after to inform him what species of yahoo particularly meant by that appellation told him that first or chief minister of state who was the person intended to describe was creature wholly exempt from joy and grief love and hatred pity and anger at least made use of no other passions but violent desire of wealth power and titles that he applies his words to all uses except to the indication of his mind that he never tells truth but with an intent that you should take it for lie nor lie but with design that you should take it for truth that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the surest way of preferment and whenever he begins to praise you to others or to yourself you are from that day forlorn the worst mark you can receive is promise especially when it is confirmed with an oath after which every wise man retires and gives over all hopes p4ch6 paragraph 10 there are three methods by which man may rise to be chief minister the first is by knowing how with prudence to dispose of wife daughter or sister the second by betraying or undermining his predecessor and the third is by furious zeal in public assemblies against the corruptions of the court but wise prince would rather choose to employ those who practice the last of these methods because such zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the will and passions of their master that these ministers having all employments at their disposal preserve themselves in power by bribing the majority of senate or great council and at last by an expedient called an act of indemnity whereof described the nature to him they secure themselves from after reckonings and retire from the public laden with the spoils of the nation the palace of chief minister is seminary to breed up others in his own trade the pages lackeys and porter by imitating their master become ministers of state in their several districts and learn to excel in the three principal ingredients of insolence lying and bribery accordingly they have subaltern court paid to them by persons of the best rank and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence arrive through several gradations to be successors to their lord he is usually governed by decayed wench or favorite footman who are the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed and may properly be called in the last resort the governors of the kingdom one day in discourse my master having heard me mention the nobility of my country was pleased to make me compliment which could not pretend to deserve that he was sure must have been born of some noble family because far exceeded in shape color and cleanliness all the yahoos of his nation although seemed to fail in strength and agility which must be imputed to my different way of living from those other brutes and besides was not only endowed with the faculty of speech but likewise with some rudiments of reason to degree that with all his acquaintance passed for prodigy he made me observe that among the houyhnhnms the white the sorrel and the iron grey were not so exactly shaped as the bay the dapple grey and the black nor born with equal talents of the mind or capacity to improve them and therefore continued always in the condition of servants without ever aspiring to match out of their own race which in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural p4ch6 paragraph 15 made his honor my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he was pleased to conceive of me but assured him at the same time that my birth was of the lower sort having been born of plain honest parents who were just able to give me tolerable education that nobility among us was altogether different thing from the idea he had of it that our young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury that as soon as years will permit they consume their vigor and contract odious diseases among lewd females and when their fortunes are almost ruined they marry some woman of mean birth disagreeable person and unsound constitution merely for the sake of money whom they hate and despise that the productions of such marriages are generally scrofulous rickety or deformed children by which means the family seldom continues above three generations unless the wife takes care to provide healthy father among her neighbors or domestics in order to improve and continue the breed that weak diseased body meagre countenance and sallow complexion are the true marks of noble blood and healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in man of quality that the world concludes his real father to have been groom or coachman the imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his body being composition of spleen dullness ignorance caprice sensuality and pride without the consent of this illustrious body no law can be enacted repealed or altered and these have the decision of all our possessions without appeal p4ch7 chapter vii the reader may be disposed to wonder how could prevail on myself to give so free representation of my own species among race of mortals who were already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of human kind from that entire congruity betwixt me and their yahoos but must freely confess that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds placed in opposite view to human corruptions had so far opened my eyes and enlarged my understanding that began to view the actions and passions of man in very different light and to think the honor of my own kind not worth managing which besides it was impossible for me to do before person of so acute judgment as my master who daily convinced me of thousand faults in myself whereof had not the least perception before and which among us would never be numbered even among human infirmities had likewise learned from his example an utter detestation of all falsehood or disguise and truth appeared so amiable to me that determined upon sacrificing everything to it let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet much stronger motive for the freedom took in my representation of things had not been year in this country before contracted such love and veneration for the inhabitants that entered on firm resolution never to return to human kind but to pass the rest of my life among these admirable houyhnhnms in the contemplation and practice of every virtue where could have no example or incitement to vice but it was decreed by fortune my perpetual enemy that so great felicity should not fall to my share however it is now some comfort to reflect that in what said of my countrymen extenuated their faults as much as dared before so strict an examiner and upon every article gave as favorable turn as the matter would bear for indeed who is there alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth have related the substance of several conversations had with my master during the greatest part of the time had the honor to be in his service but have indeed for brevity sake omitted much more than is here set down when had answered all his questions and his curiosity seemed to be fully satisfied he sent for me one morning early and commanding me to sit down at some distance an honor which he had never before conferred upon me he said he had been very seriously considering my whole story as far as it related both to myself and my country that he looked upon us as sort of animals to whose share by what accident he could not conjecture some small pittance of reason had fallen whereof we made no other use than by its assistance to aggravate our natural corruptions and to acquire new ones which nature had not given us that we disarmed ourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed had been very successful in multiplying our original wants and seemed to spend our whole lives in vain endeavors to supply them by our own inventions that as to myself it was manifest had neither the strength or agility of common yahoo that walked infirmly on my hinder feet had found out contrivance to make my claws of no use or defense and to remove the hair from my chin which was intended as shelter from the sun and the weather lastly that could neither run with speed nor climb trees like my brethren as he called them the yahoos in this country that our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our gross defects in reason and by consequence in virtue because reason alone is sufficient to govern rational creature which was therefore character we had no pretense to challenge even from the account had given of my own people although he manifestly perceived that in order to favor them had concealed many particulars and often said the thing which was not p4ch7 paragraph he was the more confirmed in this opinion because he observed that as agreed in every feature of my body with other yahoos except where it was to my real disadvantage in point of strength speed and activity the shortness of my claws and some other particulars where nature had no part so from the representation had given him of our lives our manners and our actions he found as near resemblance in the disposition of our minds he said the yahoos were known to hate one another more than they did any different species of animals and the reason usually assigned was the odiousness of their own shapes which all could see in the rest but not in themselves he had therefore begun to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies and by that invention conceal many of our own deformities from each other which would else be hardly supportable but he now found he had been mistaken and that the dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause with ours as had described them for if said he you throw among five yahoos as much food as would be sufficient for fifty they will instead of eating peaceably fall together by the ears each single one impatient to have all to itself and therefore servant was usually employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad and those kept at home were tied at distance from each other that if cow died of age or accident before houyhnhnm could secure it for his own yahoos those in the neighborhood would come in herds to seize it and then would ensue such battle as had described with terrible wounds made by their claws on both sides although they seldom were able to kill one another for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had invented at other times the like battles have been fought between the yahoos of several neighborhoods without any visible cause those of one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next before they are prepared but if they find their project has miscarried they return home and for want of enemies engage in what call civil war among themselves that in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of several colors whereof the yahoos are violently fond and when part of these stones is fixed in the earth as it sometimes happens they will dig with their claws for whole days to get them out then carry them away and hide them by heaps in their kennels but still looking round with great caution for fear their comrades should find out their treasure my master said he could never discover the reason of this unnatural appetite or how these stones could be of any use to yahoo but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice which had ascribed to mankind that he had once by way of experiment privately removed heap of these stones from the place where one of his yahoos had buried it whereupon the sordid animal missing his treasure by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place there miserably howled then fell to biting and tearing the rest began to pine away would neither eat nor sleep nor work till he ordered servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole and hide them as before which when his yahoo had found he presently recovered his spirits and good humor but took good care to remove them to better hiding place and has ever since been very serviceable brute my master farther assured me which also observed myself that in the fields where the shining stones abound the fiercest and most frequent battles are fought occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighboring yahoos he said it was common when two yahoos discovered such stone in field and were contending which of them should be the proprietor third would take the advantage and carry it away from them both which my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our suits at law wherein thought it for our credit not to undeceive him since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees among us because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside the stone they contended for whereas our courts of equity would never have dismissed the cause while either of them had any thing left my master his discourse said there was nothing that rendered the yahoos more odious than their undistinguishing appetite to devour every thing that came in their way whether herbs roots berries the corrupted flesh of animals or all mingled together and it was peculiar in their temper that they were fonder of what they could get by rapine or stealth at greater distance than much better food provided for them at home if their prey held out they would eat till they were ready to burst after which nature had pointed out to them certain root that gave them general evacuation p4ch7 paragraph 10 there was also another kind of root very juicy but somewhat rare and difficult to be found which the yahoos sought for with much eagerness and would suck it with great delight and it produced in them the same effects that wine has upon us it would make them sometimes hug and sometimes tear one another they would howl and grin and chatter and reel and tumble and then fall asleep in the dirt did indeed observe that the yahoos were the only animals in this country subject to any diseases which however were much fewer than horses have among us and contracted not by any ill treatment they meet with but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute neither has their language any more than general appellation for those maladies which is borrowed from the name of the beast and called hneayahoo or the yahoo evil and the cure prescribed is mixture of their own dung and urine forcibly put down the yahoo throat this have since often known to have been taken with success and do freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good as an admirable specific against all diseases produced by repletion as to learning government arts manufactures and the like my master confessed he could find little or no resemblance between the yahoos of that country and those in ours for he only meant to observe what parity there was in our natures he had heard indeed some curious houyhnhnms observe that in most herds there was sort of ruling yahoo as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in park who was always more deformed in body and mischievous in disposition than any of the rest that this leader had usually favorite as like himself as he could get whose employment was to lick his master feet and posteriors and drive the female yahoos to his kennel for which he was now and then rewarded with piece of ass flesh this favorite is hated by the whole herd and therefore to protect himself keeps always near the person of his leader he usually continues in office till worse can be found but the very moment he is discarded his successor at the head of all the yahoos in that district young and old male and female come in body and discharge their excrements upon him from head to foot but how far this might be applicable to our courts and favorites and ministers of state my master said could best determine dared make no return to this malicious insinuation which debased human understanding below the sagacity of common hound who has judgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack without being ever mistaken my master told me there were some qualities remarkable in the yahoos which he had not observed me to mention or at least very slightly in the accounts had given him of human kind he said those animals like other brutes had their females in common but in this they differed that the she yahoo would admit the male while she was pregnant and that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females as fiercely as with each other both which practices were such degrees of brutality that no other sensitive creature ever arrived at p4ch7 paragraph 15 another thing he wondered at in the yahoos was their strange disposition to nastiness and dirt whereas there appears to be natural love of cleanliness in all other animals as to the former accusation was glad to let it pass without any reply because had not word to offer upon it in defense of my species which otherwise certainly had done from my own inclinations but could have easily vindicated human kind from the imputation of singularity upon the last article if there had been any swine in that country as unluckily for me there were not which although it may be sweeter quadruped than yahoo can not humbly conceive in justice pretend to more cleanliness and so his honor himself must have owned if he had seen their filthy way of feeding and their custom of wallowing and sleeping in the mud my master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had discovered in several yahoos and to him was wholly unaccountable he said fancy would sometimes take yahoo to retire into corner to lie down and howl and groan and spurn away all that came near him although he were young and fat wanted neither food nor water nor did the servants imagine what could possibly ail him and the only remedy they found was to set him to hard work after which he would infallibly come to himself to this was silent out of partiality to my own kind yet here could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen which only seizes on the lazy the luxurious and the rich who if they were forced to undergo the same regimen would undertake for the cure his honor had further observed that female yahoo would often stand behind bank or bush to gaze on the young males passing by and then appear and hide using many antic gestures and grimaces at which time it was observed that she had most offensive smell and when any of the males advanced would slowly retire looking often back and with counterfeit show of fear run off into some convenient place where she knew the male would follow her at other times if female stranger came among them three or four of her own sex would get about her and stare and chatter and grin and smell her all over and then turn off with gestures that seemed to express contempt and disdain perhaps my master might refine little in these speculations which he had drawn from what he observed himself or had been told him by others however could not reflect without some amazement and much sorrow that the rudiments of coquetry censure and scandal should have place by instinct in womankind p4ch7 paragraph 20 expected every moment that my master would accuse the yahoos of those unnatural appetites in both sexes so common among us but nature it seems has not been so expert school mistress and these politer pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of the globe p4ch8 chapter viii as ought to have understood human nature much better than supposed it possible for my master to do so it was easy to apply the character he gave of the yahoos to myself and my countrymen and believed could yet make farther discoveries from my own observation therefore often begged his favor to let me go among the herds of yahoos in the neighborhood to which he always very graciously consented being perfectly convinced that the hatred bore those brutes would never suffer me to be corrupted by them and his honor ordered one of his servants strong sorrel nag very honest and goodnatured to be my guard without whose protection dare not undertake such adventures for have already told the reader how much was pestered by those odious animals upon my first arrival and afterwards failed very narrowly three or four times of falling into their clutches when happened to stray at any distance without my hanger and have reason to believe they had some imagination that was of their own species which often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves and showing my naked arms and breast in their sight when my protector was with me at which times they would approach as near as they dare and imitate my actions after the manner of monkeys but ever with great signs of hatred as tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild ones when he happens to get among them they are prodigiously nimble from their infancy however once caught young male of three years old and endeavored by all marks of tenderness to make it quiet but the little imp fell squalling and scratching and biting with such violence that was forced to let it go and it was high time for whole troop of old ones came about us at the noise but finding the cub was safe for away it ran and my sorrel nag being by they dare not venture near us observed the young animal flesh to smell very rank and the stink was somewhat between weasel and fox but much more disagreeable forgot another circumstance and perhaps might have the reader pardon if it were wholly omitted that while held the odious vermin in my hands it voided its filthy excrements of yellow liquid substance all over my clothes but by good fortune there was small brook hard by where washed myself as clean as could although dare not come into my master presence until were sufficiently aired by what could discover the yahoos appear to be the most unteachable of all animals their capacities never reaching higher than to draw or carry burdens yet am of opinion this defect arises chiefly from perverse restive disposition for they are cunning malicious treacherous and revengeful they are strong and hardy but of cowardly spirit and by consequence insolent abject and cruel it is observed that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity the houyhnhnms keep the yahoos for present use in huts not far from the house but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields where they dig up roots eat several kinds of herbs and search about for carrion or sometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs sort of wild rat which they greedily devour nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their nails on the side of rising ground wherein they lie by themselves only the kennels of the females are larger sufficient to hold two or three cubs they swim from their infancy like frogs and are able to continue long under water where they often take fish which the females carry home to their young and upon this occasion hope the reader will pardon my relating an odd adventure p4ch8 paragraph being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag and the weather exceeding hot entreated him to let me bathe in river that was near he consented and immediately stripped myself stark naked and went down softly into the stream it happened that young female yahoo standing behind bank saw the whole proceeding and inflamed by desire as the nag and conjectured came running with all speed and leaped into the water within five yards of the place where bathed was never in my life so terribly frighted the nag was grazing at some distance not suspecting any harm she embraced me after most fulsome manner roared as loud as could and the nag came galloping towards me whereupon she quitted her grasp with the utmost reluctancy and leaped upon the opposite bank where she stood gazing and howling all the time was putting on my clothes this was matter of diversion to my master and his family as well as of mortification to myself for now could no longer deny that was real yahoo in every limb and feature since the females had natural propensity to me as one of their own species neither was the hair of this brute of red color which might have been some excuse for an appetite little irregular but black as sloe and her countenance did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of the kind for think she could not be above eleven years old having lived three years in this country the reader suppose will expect that should like other travelers give him some account of the manners and customs of its inhabitants which it was indeed my principal study to learn as these noble houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with general disposition to all virtues and have no conceptions or ideas of what is evil in rational creature so their grand maxim is to cultivate reason and to be wholly governed by it neither is reason among them point problematical as with us where men can argue with plausibility on both sides of the question but strikes you with immediate conviction as it must needs do where it is not mingled obscured or discolored by passion and interest remember it was with extreme difficulty that could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion or how point could be disputable because reason taught us to affirm or deny only where we are certain and beyond our knowledge we can not do either so that controversies wranglings disputes and positiveness in false or dubious propositions are evils unknown among the houyhnhnms in the like manner when used to explain to him our several systems of natural philosophy he would laugh that creature pretending to reason should value itself upon the knowledge of other people conjectures and in things where that knowledge if it were certain could be of no use wherein he agreed entirely with the sentiments of socrates as plato delivers them which mention as the highest honor can do that prince of philosophers have often since reflected what destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of europe and how many paths to fame would be then shut up in the learned world friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the houyhnhnms and these not confined to particular objects but universal to the whole race for stranger from the remotest part is equally treated with the nearest neighbor and wherever he goes looks upon himself as at home they preserve decency and civility in the highest degrees but are altogether ignorant of ceremony they have no fondness for their colts or foals but the care they take in educating them proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason and observed my master to show the same affection to his neighbor issue that he had for his own they will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole species and it is reason only that makes distinction of persons where there is superior degree of virtue p4ch8 paragraph 10 when the matron houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex they no longer accompany with their consorts except they lose one of their issue by some casualty which very seldom happens but in such case they meet again or when the like accident befalls person whose wife is past bearing some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts and then go together again till the mother is pregnant this caution is necessary to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers but the race of inferior houyhnhnms bred up to be servants is not so strictly limited upon this article these are allowed to produce three of each sex to be domestics in the noble families in their marriages they are exactly careful to choose such colors as will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed strength is chiefly valued in the male and comeliness in the female not upon the account of love but to preserve the race from degenerating for where female happens to excel in strength consort is chosen with regard to comeliness courtship love presents jointures settlements have no place in their thoughts or terms whereby to express them in their language the young couple meet and are joined merely because it is the determination of their parents and friends it is what they see done every day and they look upon it as one of the necessary actions of rational being but the violation of marriage or any other unchastity was never heard of and the married pair pass their lives with the same friendship and mutual benevolence that they bear to all others of the same species who come in their way without jealousy fondness quarrelling or discontent in educating the youth of both sexes their method is admirable and highly deserves our imitation these are not suffered to taste grain of oats except upon certain days till eighteen years old nor milk but very rarely and in summer they graze two hours in the morning and as long in the evening which their parents likewise observe but the servants are not allowed above half that time and great part of their grass is brought home which they eat at the most convenient hours when they can be best spared from work temperance industry exercise and cleanliness are the lessons equally enjoined to the young ones of both sexes and my master thought it monstrous in us to give the females different kind of education from the males except in some articles of domestic management whereby as he truly observed one half of our natives were good for nothing but bringing children into the world and to trust the care of our children to such useless animals he said was yet greater instance of brutality but the houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength speed and hardiness by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills and over hard stony grounds and when they are all in sweat they are ordered to leap over head and ears into pond or river four times year the youth of certain district meet to show their proficiency in running and leaping and other feats of strength and agility where the victor is rewarded with song made in his or her praise on this festival the servants drive herd of yahoos into the field laden with hay and oats and milk for repast to the houyhnhnms after which these brutes are immediately driven back again for fear of being noisome to the assembly p4ch8 paragraph 15 every fourth year at the vernal equinox there is representative council of the whole nation which meets in plain about twenty miles from our house and continues about five or six days here they inquire into the state and condition of the several districts whether they abound or be deficient in hay or oats or cows or yahoos and wherever there is any want which is seldom it is immediately supplied by unanimous consent and contribution here likewise the regulation of children is settled as for instance if houyhnhnm has two males he changes one of them with another that has two females and when child has been lost by any casualty where the mother is past breeding it is determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the loss p4ch9 chapter ix one of these grand assemblies was held in my time about three months before my departure whither my master went as the representative of our district in this council was resumed their old debate and indeed the only debate which ever happened in that country whereof my master after his return gave me very particular account the question to be debated was whether the yahoos should be exterminated from the face of the earth one of the members for the affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight alleging that as the yahoos were the most filthy noisome and deformed animal which nature ever produced so they were the most restive and indocible mischievous and malicious they would privately suck the teats of the houyhnhnms cows kill and devour their cats trample down their oats and grass if they were not continually watched and commit thousand other extravagancies he took notice of general tradition that yahoos had not been always in that country but that many ages ago two of these brutes appeared together upon mountain whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime or from the ooze and froth of the sea was never known that these yahoos engendered and their brood in short time grew so numerous as to overrun and infest the whole nation that the houyhnhnms to get rid of this evil made general hunting and at last enclosed the whole herd and destroying the elder every houyhnhnm kept two young ones in kennel and brought them to such degree of tameness as an animal so savage by nature can be capable of acquiring using them for draught and carriage that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition and that those creatures could not be ylnhniamshy or aborigines of the land because of the violent hatred the houyhnhnms as well as all other animals bore them which although their evil disposition sufficiently deserved could never have arrived at so high degree if they had been aborigines or else they would have long since been rooted out that the inhabitants taking fancy to use the service of the yahoos had very imprudently neglected to cultivate the breed of asses which were comely animal easily kept more tame and orderly without any offensive smell strong enough for labor although they yield to the other in agility of body and if their braying be no agreeable sound it is far preferable to the horrible howlings of the yahoos several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose when my master proposed an expedient to the assembly whereof he had indeed borrowed the hint from me he approved of the tradition mentioned by the honorable member who spoke before and affirmed that the two yahoos said to be first seen among them had been driven there over the sea that coming to land and being forsaken by their companions they retired to the mountains and degenerating by degrees became in process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the country from where these two originals came the reason of his assertion was that he had now in his possession certain wonderful yahoo meaning myself which most of them had heard of and many of them had seen he then related to them how he first found me that my body was all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other animals that spoke in language of my own and had thoroughly learned theirs that had related to him the accidents which brought me there that when he saw me without my covering was an exact yahoo in every part only of whiter color less hairy and with shorter claws he added how had endeavored to persuade him that in my own and other countries the yahoos acted as the governing rational animal and held the houyhnhnms in servitude that he observed in me all the qualities of yahoo only little more civilized by some tincture of reason which however was in degree as far inferior to the houyhnhnm race as the yahoos of their country were to me that among other things mentioned custom we had of castrating houyhnhnms when they were young in order to render them tame that the operation was easy and safe that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes as industry is taught by the ant and building by the swallow for so translate the word lyhannh although it be much larger fowl that this invention might be practiced upon the younger yahoos here which besides rendering them tractable and fitter for use would in an age put an end to the whole species without destroying life that in the meantime the houyhnhnms should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses which as they are in all respects more valuable brutes so they have this advantage to be fit for service at five years old which the others are not till twelve this was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of what passed in the grand council but he was pleased to conceal one particular which related personally to myself whereof soon felt the unhappy effect as the reader will know in its proper place and from which date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life the houyhnhnms have no letters and consequently their knowledge is all traditional but there happening few events of any moment among people so well united naturally disposed to every virtue wholly governed by reason and cut off from all commerce with other nations the historical part is easily preserved without burdening their memories have already observed that they are subject to no diseases and therefore can have no need of physicians however they have excellent medicines composed of herbs to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or frog of the foot by sharp stones as well as other maims and hurts in the several parts of the body p4ch9 paragraph they calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and the moon but use no subdivisions into weeks they are well enough acquainted with the motions of those two luminaries and understand the nature of eclipses and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy in poetry they must be allowed to excel all other mortals wherein the justness of their similes and the minuteness as well as exactness of their descriptions are indeed inimitable their verses abound very much in both of these and usually contain either some exalted notions of friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in races and other bodily exercises their buildings although very rude and simple are not inconvenient but well contrived to defend them from all injuries of cold and heat they have kind of tree which at forty years old loosens in the root and falls with the first storm they grow very straight and being pointed like stakes with sharp stone for the houyhnhnms know not the use of iron they stick them erect in the ground about ten inches asunder and then weave in oat straw or sometimes wattles betwixt them the roof is made after the same manner and so are the doors the houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the hoof of their fore feet as we do our hands and this with greater dexterity than could at first imagine have seen white mare of our family thread needle which lent her on purpose with that joint they milk their cows reap their oats and do all the work which requires hands in the same manner they have kind of hard flints which by grinding against other stones they form into instruments that serve instead of wedges axes and hammers with tools made of these flints they likewise cut their hay and reap their oats which there groweth naturally in several fields the yahoos draw home the sheaves in carriages and the servants tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain which is kept in stores they make rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels and bake the former in the sun if they can avoid casualties they die only of old age and are buried in the most obscure places that can be found their friends and relations expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure nor does the dying person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world any more than if he were upon returning home from visit to one of his neighbors remember my master having once made an appointment with friend and his family to come to his house upon some affair of importance on the day fixed the mistress and her two children came very late she made two excuses first for her husband who as she said happened that very morning to shnuwnh the word is strongly expressive in their language but not easily rendered into english it signifies to retire to his first mother her excuse for not coming sooner was that her husband dying late in the morning she was good while consulting her servants about convenient place where his body should be laid and observed she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest and died about three months after they live generally to seventy or seventyfive years very seldom to fourscore some weeks before their death they feel gradual decay but without pain during this time they are much visited by their friends because they can not go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction however about ten days before their death which they seldom fail in computing they return the visits that have been made them by those who are nearest in the neighborhood being carried in convenient sledge drawn by yahoos which vehicle they use not only upon this occasion but when they grow old upon long journeys or when they are lamed by any accident and therefore when the dying houyhnhnms return those visits they take solemn leave of their friends as if they were going to some remote part of the country where they designed to pass the rest of their lives p4ch9 paragraph 10 know not whether it may be worth observing that the houyhnhnms have no word in their language to express any thing that is evil except what they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the yahoos thus they denote the folly of servant an omission of child stone that cuts their feet continuance of foul or unseasonable weather and the like by adding to each the epithet of yahoo for instance hhnm yahoo whnaholm yahoo ynlhmndwihlma yahoo and an illcontrived house ynholmhnmrohlnw yahoo could with great pleasure enlarge further upon the manners and virtues of this excellent people but intending in short time to publish volume by itself expressly upon that subject refer the reader there and in the meantime proceed to relate my own sad catastrophe p4ch10 chapter had settled my little economy to my own heart content my master had ordered room to be made for me after their manner about six yards from the house the sides and floors of which plastered with clay and covered with rushmats of my own contriving had beaten hemp which there grows wild and made of it sort of ticking this filled with the feathers of several birds had taken with springes made of yahoos hairs and were excellent food had worked two chairs with my knife the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part when my clothes were worn to rags made myself others with the skins of rabbits and of certain beautiful animal about the same size called nnuhnoh the skin of which is covered with fine down of these likewise made very tolerable stockings soled my shoes with wood which cut from tree and fitted to the upper leather and when this was worn out supplied it with the skins of yahoos dried in the sun often got honey out of hollow trees which mingled with water or ate with my bread no man could more verify the truth of these two maxims that nature is very easily satisfied and that necessity is the mother of invention enjoyed perfect health of body and tranquillity of mind did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of friend nor the injuries of secret or open enemy had no occasion of bribing flattering or pimping to procure the favor of any great man or of his minion wanted no fence against fraud or oppression here was neither physician to destroy my body nor lawyer to ruin my fortune no informer to watch my words and actions or forge accusations against me for hire here were no gibers censurers backbiters pickpockets highwaymen housebreakers attorneys bawds buffoons gamesters politicians wits splenetics tedious talkers controvertists ravishers murderers robbers virtuosos no leaders or followers of party and faction no encouragers to vice by seducement or examples no dungeon axes gibbets whipping posts or pillories no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics no pride vanity or affectation no fops bullies drunkards strolling whores or poxes no ranting lewd expensive wives no stupid proud pedants no importunate overbearing quarrelsome noisy roaring empty conceited swearing companions no scoundrels raised from the dust for the sake of their vices or nobility thrown into it on account of their virtues no lords fiddlers judges or dancing masters had the favor of being admitted to several houyhnhnms who came to visit or dine with my master where his honor graciously suffered me to wait in the room and listen to their discourse both he and his company would often descend to ask me questions and receive my answers had also sometimes the honor of attending my master in his visits to others never presumed to speak except in answer to question and then did it with inward regret because it was loss of so much time for improving myself but was infinitely delighted with the station of an humble auditor in such conversations where nothing passed but what was useful expressed in the fewest and most significant words where the greatest decency was observed without the least degree of ceremony where no person spoke without being pleased himself and pleasing his companions where there was no interruption tediousness heat or difference of sentiments they have notion that when people are met together silence does much improve conversation this found to be true for during those little intermissions of talk new ideas would arise in their thoughts which very much enlivened the discourse their subjects are generally on friendship and benevolence or order and economy sometimes upon the visible operations of nature or ancient traditions upon the bounds and limits of virtue upon the unerring rules of reason or upon some determinations to be taken at the next great assembly and often upon the various excellencies of poetry may add without vanity that my presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse because it afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of me and my country upon which they were all pleased to descant in manner not very advantageous to human kind and for that reason shall not repeat what they said only may be allowed to observe that his honor to my great admiration appeared to understand the nature of yahoos in all countries much better than myself he went through all our vices and follies and discovered many which had never mentioned to him by only supposing what qualities yahoo of their country with small proportion of reason might be capable of exerting and concluded with too much probability how vile as well as miserable such creature must be freely confess that all the little knowledge have of any value was acquired by the lectures received from my master and from hearing the discourses of him and his friends to which should be prouder to listen than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in europe admired the strength comeliness and speed of the inhabitants and such constellation of virtues in such amiable persons produced in me the highest veneration at first indeed did not feel that natural awe which the yahoos and all other animals bear towards them but it grew upon me by degrees much sooner than imagined and was mingled with respectful love and gratitude that they would condescend to distinguish me from the rest of my species when thought of my family my friends my countrymen or human race in general considered them as they really were yahoos in shape and disposition perhaps little more civilized and qualified with the gift of speech but making no other use of reason than to improve and multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the share that nature allotted them when happened to behold the reflection of my own form in lake or fountain turned away my face in horror and detestation of myself and could better endure the sight of common yahoo than of my own person by conversing with the houyhnhnms and looking upon them with delight fell to imitate their gait and gesture which is now grown into an habit and my friends often tell me in blunt way that trot like horse which however take for great compliment neither shall disown that in speaking am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the houyhnhnms and hear myself ridiculed on that account without the least mortification in the midst of all this happiness and when looked upon myself to be fully settled for life my master sent for me one morning little earlier than his usual hour observed by his countenance that he was in some perplexity and at loss how to begin what he had to speak after short silence he told me he did not know how would take what he was going to say that in the last general assembly when the affair of the yahoos was entered upon the representatives had taken offense at his keeping yahoo meaning myself in his family more like houyhnhnm than brute animal that he was known frequently to converse with me as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company that such practice was not agreeable to reason or nature nor thing ever heard of before among them the assembly did therefore exhort him either to employ me like the rest of my species or command me to swim back to the place from where came that the first of these expedients was utterly rejected by all the houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at his house or their own for they alleged that because had some rudiments of reason added to the natural pravity of those animals it was to be feared might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous parts of the country and bring them in troops by night to destroy the houyhnhnms cattle as being naturally of the ravenous kind and averse from labor p4ch10 paragraph my master added that he was daily pressed by the houyhnhnms of the neighborhood to have the assembly exhortation executed which he could not put off much longer he doubted it would be impossible for me to swim to another country and therefore wished would contrive some sort of vehicle resembling those had described to him that might carry me on the sea in which work should have the assistance of his own servants as well as those of his neighbors he concluded that for his own part he could have been content to keep me in his service as long as lived because he found had cured myself of some bad habits and dispositions by endeavoring as far as my inferior nature was capable to imitate the houyhnhnms should here observe to the reader that decree of the general assembly in this country is expressed by the word hnhloayn which signifies an exhortation as near as can render it for they have no conception how rational creature can be compelled but only advised or exhorted because no person can disobey reason without giving up his claim to be rational creature was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master discourse and being unable to support the agonies was under fell into swoon at his feet when came to myself he told me that he concluded had been dead for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of nature answered in faint voice that death would have been too great happiness that although could not blame the assembly exhortation or the urgency of his friends yet in my weak and corrupt judgment thought it might consist with reason to have been less rigorous that could not swim league and probably the nearest land to theirs might be distant above hundred that many materials necessary for making small vessel to carry me off were wholly wanting in this country which however would attempt in obedience and gratitude to his honor although concluded the thing to be impossible and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction that the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils for supposing should escape with life by some strange adventure how could think with temper of passing my days among yahoos and relapsing into my old corruptions for want of examples to lead and keep me within the paths of virtue that knew too well upon what solid reasons all the determinations of the wise houyhnhnms were founded not to be shaken by arguments of mine miserable yahoo and therefore after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants assistance in making vessel and desiring reasonable time for so difficult work told him would endeavor to preserve wretched being and if ever returned to england was not without hopes of being useful to my own species by celebrating the praises of the renowned houyhnhnms and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind my master in few words made me very gracious reply allowed me the space of two months to finish my boat and ordered the sorrel nag my fellow servant for so this distance may presume to call him to follow my instructions because told my master that his help would be sufficient and knew he had tenderness for me in his company my first business was to go to that part of the coast where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore got upon height and looking on every side into the sea fancied saw small island towards the northeast took out my pocketglass and could then clearly distinguish it about five leagues off as computed but it appeared to the sorrel nag to be only blue cloud for as he had no conception of any country beside his own so he could not be as expert in distinguishing remote objects at sea as we who so much converse in that element p4ch10 paragraph 10 after had discovered this island considered no farther but resolved it should if possible be the first place of my banishment leaving the consequence to fortune returned home and consulting with the sorrel nag we went into copse at some distance where with my knife and he with sharp flint fastened very artificially after their manner to wooden handle cut down several oak wattles about the thickness of walkingstaff and some larger pieces but shall not trouble the reader with particular description of my own mechanics let it suffice to say that in six weeks time with the help of the sorrel nag who performed the parts that required most labor finished sort of indian canoe but much larger covering it with the skins of yahoos well stitched together with hempen threads of my own making my sail was likewise composed of the skins of the same animal but made use of the youngest could get the older being too tough and thick and likewise provided myself with four paddles laid in stock of boiled flesh of rabbits and fowls and took with me two vessels one fined with milk and the other with water tried my canoe in large pond near my master house and then corrected in it what was amiss stopping all the chinks with yahoos tallow till found it staunch and able to bear me and my freight and when it was as complete as could possibly make it had it drawn on carriage very gently by yahoos to the seaside under the conduct of the sorrel nag and another servant when all was ready and the day came for my departure took leave of my master and lady and the whole family my eyes flowing with tears and my heart quite sunk with grief but his honor out of curiosity and perhaps if may speak it without vanity partly out of kindness was determined to see me in my canoe and got several of his neighboring friends to accompany him was forced to wait above an hour for the tide and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing towards the island to which intended to steer my course took second leave of my master but as was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof he did me the honor to raise it gently to my mouth am not ignorant how much have been censured for mentioning this last particular for my detractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious person should descend to give so great mark of distinction to creature so inferior as neither have forgot how apt some travelers are to boast of extraordinary favors they have received but if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and courteous disposition of the houyhnhnms they would soon change their opinion p4ch10 paragraph 15 paid my respects to the rest of the houyhnhnms in his honor company then getting into my canoe pushed off from shore p4ch11 chapter xi began this desperate voyage on february 15 17145 at oclock in the morning the wind was very favorable however made use at first only of my paddles but considering should soon be weary and that the wind might chop about ventured set up my little sail and thus with the help of the tide went at the rate of league and half an hour as near as could guess my master and his friends continued on the shore till was almost out of sight and often heard the sorrel nag who always loved me crying out hnuy illa nyha majah yahoo take care of thyself gentle yahoo my design was if possible to discover some small island uninhabited yet sufficient by my labor to furnish me with the necessaries of life which would have thought greater happiness than to be first minister in the politest court of europe so horrible was the idea conceived of returning to live in the society and under the government of yahoos for in such solitude as desired could at least enjoy my own thoughts and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable houyhnhnms without any opportunity of degenerating into the vices and corruptions of my own species the reader may remember what related when my crew conspired against me and confined me to my cabin how continued there several weeks without knowing what course we took and when was put ashore in the longboat how the sailors told me with oaths whether true or false that not in what part of the world we were however did then believe us to be about ten degrees southward of the cape of good hope or about 45degrees souther latitude as gathered from some general words overheard among them being supposed to the southeast in their intended voyage to madagascar and although this were but little better than conjecture resolved to steer my course eastward hoping to reach the southwest coast of new holland and perhaps some such island as desired lying westward of it the wind was full west and by six in the evening computed had gone eastward at least eighteen leagues when spied very small island about half league off which soon reached it was nothing but rock with one creek naturally arched by the force of tempests here put in my canoe and climbing up part of the rock could plainly discover land to the east extending from south to north lay all night in my canoe and repeating my voyage early in the morning arrived in seven hours to the southeast point of new holland this confirmed me in the opinion have long entertained that the maps and charts place this country at least three degrees more to the east than it really is which thought communicated many years ago to my worthy friend mr herman moll and gave him my reasons for it although he has rather chosen to follow other authors saw no inhabitants in the place where landed and being unarmed was afraid of venturing far into the country found some shellfish on the shore and ate them raw not daring to kindle fire for fear of being discovered by the natives continued three days feeding on oysters and limpets to save my own provisions and fortunately found brook of excellent water which gave me great relief on the fourth day venturing out early little too far saw twenty or thirty natives upon height not above five hundred yards from me they were stark naked men women and children round fire as could discover by the smoke one of them spied me and gave notice to the rest five of them advanced towards me leaving the women and children at the fire made what haste could to the shore and getting into my canoe shoved off the savages observing me retreat ran after me and before could get far enough into the sea discharged an arrow which wounded me deeply on the inside of my left knee shall carry the mark to my grave apprehended the arrow might be poisoned and paddling out of the reach of their darts being calm day made shift to suck the wound and dress it as well as could p4ch11 paragraph was at loss what to do for durst not return to the same landingplace but stood to the north and was forced to paddle for the wind though very gentle was against me blowing northwest as was looking about for secure landingplace saw sail to the northnortheast which appearing every minute more visible was in some doubt whether should wait for them or no but at last my detestation of the yahoo race prevailed and turning my canoe sailed and paddled together to the south and got into the same creek from whence set out in the morning choosing rather to trust myself among these barbarians than live with european yahoos drew up my canoe as close as could to the shore and hid myself behind stone by the little brook which as have already said was excellent water the ship came within half league of this creek and sent her longboat with vessels to take in fresh water for the place it seems was very well known but did not observe it till the boat was almost on shore and it was too late to seek another hidingplace the seamen at their landing observed my canoe and rummaging it all over easily conjectured that the owner could not be far off four of them well armed searched every cranny and lurkinghole till at last they found me flat on my face behind the stone they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth dress my coat made of skins my woodensoled shoes and my furred stockings from whence however they concluded was not native of the place who all go naked one of the seamen in portuguese bid me rise and asked who was understood that language very well and getting upon feet said was poor yahoo banished from the houyhnhnms and desired they would please to let me depart they admired to hear me answer them in their own tongue and saw by my complexion must be european but were at loss to know what meant by yahoos and houyhnhnms and at the same time fell laughing at my strange tone in speaking which resembled the neighing of horse trembled all the while between fear and hatred again desired leave to depart and was gently moving to my canoe but they laid hold of me desiring to know what country was of whence came with many other questions told them was born in england from whence came about five years ago and then their country and ours were at peace therefore hoped they would not treat me as an enemy since meant them no harm but was poor yahoo seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his unfortunate life when they began to talk thought never heard or saw any thing so unnatural for it appeared to me as dog or cow should speak in england or yahoo in houyhnhnmland the honest portuguese were equally amazed at my strange dress and the odd manner of delivering my words which however they understood very well they spoke to me with great humanity and said they were sure the captain would carry me gratis to lisbon from whence might return to my own country that two of the seamen would go back to the ship inform the captain of what they had seen and receive his order in the mean time unless would give my solemn oath not to fly they would secure me by force thought it best to comply with their proposal they were very curious to know my story but gave them very little satisfaction and they all conjectured my misfortunes had impaired my reason in two hours the boat which went laden with vessels of water returned with the captain command to fetch me on board fell on my knees to preserve my liberty but all was in vain and the men having tied me with cords heaved me into the boat from whence was taken into the ship and from thence into the captain cabin his name was pedro de mendez he was very courteous and generous person he entreated me to give some account of myself and desired to know what would eat or drink said should be used as well as himself and spoke so many obliging things that wondered to find such civilities from yahoo however remained silent and sullen was ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men at last desired something to eat out of my own canoe but he ordered me chicken and some excellent wine and then directed that should be put to bed in very clean cabin would not undress myself but lay on the bedclothes and in half an hour stole out when thought the crew was at dinner and getting to the side of the ship was going to leap into the sea and swim for my life rather than continue among yahoos but one of the seamen prevented me and having informed the captain was chained to my cabin after dinner don pedro came to me and desired to know my reason for so desperate an attempt assured me he only meant to do me all the service he was able and spoke so very movingly that at last descended to treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason gave him very short relation of my voyage of the conspiracy against me by own men of the country where they set me on shore and of my three years residence there all which he looked upon as if it were dream or vision whereat took great offense for had quite forgotten the faculty of lying so peculiar to yahoos in all countries where they preside and consequently the disposition of suspecting truth in others of their own asked him whether it were the custom in his country to say the thing that was not assured him had almost forgotten what he meant by falsehood and if had lived thousand years in houyhnhnmland should never have heard lie from the meanest servant that was altogether indifferent whether he believed me or not but however in return for his favors would give so much allowance to the corruption of his nature as to answer any objection he would please to make and then he might easily discover the truth p4ch11 paragraph 10 the captain wise man after many endeavors to catch me tripping in some part of my story at last began to have better opinion of my veracity and the rather because he confessed he met with dutch skipper who pretended to have landed with five others of his crew upon certain island or continent south of new holland where they went for fresh water and observed horse driving before him several animals exactly resembling those described under the name of yahoos with some other particulars which the captain said he had forgotten because he then concluded them all to be lies but he added that since professed so inviolable an attachment to truth must give him my word of honor to bear him company in this voyage without attempting any thing against my life or else he would continue me prisoner till we arrived at lisbon gave him the promise he required but at the same time protested that would suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live among yahoos our voyage passed without any considerable accident in gratitude to the captain sometimes sat with him at his earnest request and strove to conceal my antipathy to human kind although it often broke out which he suffered to pass without observation but the greatest part of the day confined myself to my cabin to avoid seeing any of the crew the captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had this would not be prevailed on to accept abhorring to cover myself with any thing that had been on the back of yahoo only desired he would lend me two clean shirts which having been washed since he wore them believed would not so much defile me these changed every second day and washed them myself we arrived at lisbon nov 1715 at our landing the captain forced me to cover myself with his cloak to prevent the rabble from crowding about me was conveyed to his own house and at my earnest request he led me up to the highest room backwards conjured him to conceal from all persons what had told him of the houyhnhnms because the least hint of such story would not only draw numbers of people to see me but probably put me in danger of being imprisoned or burned by the inquisition the captain persuaded me to accept suit of clothes newly made but would not suffer the tailor to take my measure however don pedro being almost of my size they fitted me well enough he accoutred me with other necessaries all new which aired for twentyfour hours before would use them the captain had no wife nor above three servants none of which were suffered to attend at meals and his whole deportment was so obliging added to very good human understanding that really began to tolerate his company he gained so far upon me that ventured to look out of the back window by degrees was brought into another room from whence peeped into the street but drew my head back in fright in week time he seduced me down to the door found my terror gradually lessened but my hatred and contempt seemed to increase was at last bold enough to walk the street in his company but kept my nose well stopped with rue or sometimes with tobacco in ten days don pedro to whom had given some account of my domestic affairs put it upon me as matter of honor and conscience that ought to return to my native country and live at home with my wife and children he told me there was an english ship in the port just ready to sail and he would furnish me with all things necessary it would be tedious to repeat his arguments and my contradictions he said it was altogether impossible to find such solitary island as had desired to live in but might command in my own house and pass my time in manner as recluse as pleased p4ch11 paragraph 15 complied at last finding could not do better left lisbon the 24th day of november in an english merchantman but who was the master never inquired don pedro accompanied me to the ship and lent me twenty pounds he took kind leave of me and embraced me at parting which bore as well as could during this last voyage had no commerce with the master or any of his men but pretending was sick kept close in my cabin on the fifth of december 1715 we cast anchor in the downs about nine in the morning and at three in the afternoon got safe to my house at rotherhith my wife and family received me with great surprise and joy because they concluded me certainly dead but must freely confess the sight of them filled me only with hatred disgust and contempt and the more by reflecting on the near alliance had to them for although since my unfortunate exile from the houyhnhnm country had compelled myself to tolerate the sight of yahoos and to converse with don pedro de mendez yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues and ideas of those exalted houyhnhnms and when began to consider that by copulating with one of the yahoo species had become parent of more it struck me with the utmost shame confusion and horror as soon as entered the house my wife took me in her arms and kissed me at which having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for so many years fell in swoon for almost an hour at the time am writing it is five years since my last return to england during the first year could not endure my wife or children in my presence the very smell of them was intolerable much less could suffer them to eat in the same room to this hour they dare not presume to touch my bread or drink out of the same cup neither was ever able to let one of them take me by the hand the first money laid out was to buy two young stonehorses which keep in good stable and next to them the groom is my greatest favorite for feel my spirits revived by the smell he contracts in the stable my horses understand me tolerably well converse with them at least four hours every day they are strangers to bridle or saddle they live in great amity with me and friendship to each other p4ch12 chapter xii thus gentle reader have given thee faithful history of my travels for sixteen years and above seven months wherein have not been so studious of ornament as truth could perhaps like others have astonished you with strange improbable tales but rather chose to relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style because my principal design was to inform and not to amuse you it is easy for us who travel into remote countries which are seldom visited by englishmen or other europeans to form descriptions of wonderful animals both at sea and land whereas traveler chief aim should be to make men wiser and better and to improve their minds by the bad as well as good example of what they deliver concerning foreign places could heartily wish law was enacted that every traveler before he were permitted to publish his voyages should be obliged to make oath before the lord high chancellor that all he intended to print was absolutely true to the best of his knowledge for then the world would no longer be deceived as it usually is while some writers to make their works pass the better upon the public impose the grossest falsities on the unwary reader have perused several books of travels with great delight in my younger days but having since gone over most parts of the globe and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts from my own observation it has given me great disgust against this part of reading and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so impudently abused therefore since my acquaintances were pleased to think my poor endeavors might not be unacceptable to my country imposed on myself as maxim never to be swerved from that would strictly adhere to truth neither indeed can be ever under the least temptation to vary from it while retain in my mind the lectures and example of my noble master and the other illustrious houyhnhnms of whom had so long the honor to be humble bearer nec si miserum fortuna sinonem p4ch12 paragraph finxit vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget know very well how little reputation is to be gotten by writings which require neither genius nor learning nor indeed any other talent except good memory or an exact journal know likewise that writers of travels like dictionarymakers are sunk into oblivion by the weight and bulk of those who come after and therefore lie uppermost and it is highly probable that such travelers who shall hereafter visit the countries described in this work of mine may by detecting my errors if there be any and adding many new discoveries of their own jostle me out of vogue and stand in my place making the world forget that was ever an author this indeed would be too great mortification if wrote for fame but as my sole intention was the public good can not be altogether disappointed for who can read of the virtues have mentioned in the glorious houyhnhnms without being ashamed of his own vices when he considers himself as the reasoning governing animal of his country shall say nothing of those remote nations where yahoos preside amongst which the least corrupted are the brobdingnagians whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe but forbear descanting farther and rather leave the judicious reader to own remarks and applications am not little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with no censurers for what objections can be made against writer who relates only plain facts that happened in such distant countries where we have not the least interest with respect either to trade or negotiations have carefully avoided every fault with which common writers of travels are often too justly charged besides meddle not the least with any party but write without passion prejudice or illwill against any man or number of men whatsoever write for the noblest end to inform and instruct mankind over whom may without breach of modesty pretend to some superiority from the advantages received by conversing so long among the most accomplished houyhnhnms write without any view towards profit or praise never suffer word to pass that may look like reflection or possibly give the least offence even to those who are most ready to take it so that hope may with justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless against whom the tribes of answerers considerers observers reflecters detecters remarkers will never be able to find matter for exercising their talents confess it was whispered to me that was bound in duty as subject of england to have given in memorial to secretary of state at my first coming over because whatever lands are discovered by subject belong to the crown but doubt whether our conquests in the countries treat of would be as easy as those of ferdinando cortez over the naked americans the lilliputians think are hardly worth the charge of fleet and army to reduce them and question whether it might be prudent or safe to attempt the brobdingnagians or whether an english army would be much at their ease with the flying island over their heads the houyhnhnms indeed appear not to be so well prepared for war science to which they are perfect strangers and especially against missive weapons however supposing myself to be minister of state could never give my advice for invading them their prudence unanimity unacquaintedness with fear and their love of their country would amply supply all defects in the military art imagine twenty thousand of them breaking into the midst of european army confounding the confounding the ranks overturning the carriages battering the warriors faces into mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs for they would well deserve the character given to augustus recalcitrat unclique tutus but instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation rather wish they were in capacity or disposition to send number of their inhabitants for civilizing europe by teaching us the first principles of honor truth temperance public spirit fortitude chastity benevolence and fidelity the names of all which virtues are still retained among us in languages and are to be met with in modern as well as ancient which am able to assert from my own small reading p4ch12 paragraph 10 but had another reason which made me less forward to enlarge his majesty dominions by my discoveries to say the truth had conceived few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon those occasions for instance crew of pirates are driven by storm they know not whither at length boy discovers land from the topmast they go on shore to rob and plunder they see harmless people are entertained with kindness they give the country new name they take formal possession of it for their king they set up rotten plank or stone for memorial they murder two or three dozen of the natives bring away couple more by force for sample return home and get their pardon here commences new dominion acquired with title by divine right ships are sent with the first opportunity the natives driven out or destroyed their princes tortured to discover their gold free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust the earth reeking with the blood of its inhabitants and this execrable crew of butchers employed in so pious an expedition is modern colony sent to convert and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people but this description confess does by no means affect the british nation who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom care and justice in planting colonies their liberal endowments for the advancement of religion and learning their choice of devout and able pastors to propagate christianity their caution in stocking their provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the mother kingdom their strict regard to the distribution of justice in supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with officers of the greatest abilities utter strangers to corruption and to crown all by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors who have no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they preside and the honor of the king their master but as those countries which have described do not appear to have any desire of being conquered and enslaved murdered or driven out by colonies nor abound either in gold silver sugar or tobacco did humbly conceive they were by no means proper objects of our zeal our valor or our interest however if those whom it more concerns think fit to be of another opinion am ready to depose when shall be lawfully called that no european did ever visit these countries before me mean if the inhabitants ought to he believed unless dispute may arise about the two yahoos said to have been seen many ages ago in mountain in houyhnhnmland from whence the opinion is that the race of those brutes has descended and these for anything know may have been english which indeed was apt to suspect from the lineaments of their posterity countenances although very much defaced but how far that will go to make out title leave to the learned in colonylaw but as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign name it never came once into my thoughts and if it had yet as my affairs then stood should perhaps in point of prudence and selfpreservation have put it off to better opportunity having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against me as traveler here take final leave of all my courteous readers and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at redriff to apply those excellent lessons of virtue which learned among the houyhnhnms to instruct the yahoos of my own family as far as shall find them docile animals to behold my figure often in glass and thus if possible habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of human creature to lament the brutality of houyhnhnms in my own country but always treat their persons with respect for the sake of my noble master his family his friends and the whole houyhnhnm race whom these ours have the honor to resemble in all their lineaments however their intellectuals came to degenerate p4ch12 paragraph 15 began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me at the farthest end of long table and to answer but with the utmost brevity the few questions ask her yet the smell of yahoo continuing very offensive always keep my nose well stopped with rue lavender or tobacco leaves and although it be hard for man late in life to remove old habits am not altogether out of hopes in some time to suffer neighbor yahoo in my company without the apprehensions am yet under of his teeth or his claws my reconcilement to the yahookind in general might not be so difficult if they would be content with those vices and follies only which nature has entitled them to am not in the least provoked at the sight of lawyer pickpocket colonel fool lord gamester politician whoremaster physician an evidence suborner an attorney traitor or the like this is all according to the due course of things but when behold lump of deformity and diseases both in body and mind smitten with pride it immediately breaks all the measures of my patience neither shall be ever able to comprehend how such an animal and such vice could tally together the wise and virtuous houyhnhnms who abound in all excellencies that can adorn rational creature have no name for this vice in their language which has no terms to express anything that is evil except those whereby they describe the detestable qualities of their yahoos among which they were not able to distinguish this of pride for want of thoroughly understanding human nature as it shows itself in other countries where that animal presides but who had more experience could plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild yahoos but the houyhnhnms who live under the government of reason are no more proud of the good qualities they possess than should be for not wanting leg or an arm which no man in his wits would boast of although he must be miserable without them dwell the longer upon this subject from the desire have to make the society of an english yahoo by any means not insupportable and therefore here entreat those who have any tincture of this absurd vice that they will not presume to come in my sight the end electronically enhanced text copyright 1991 1992 world library inc
