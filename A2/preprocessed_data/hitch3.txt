douglas adams life the universe and everything douglas adams the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy douglas adams the restaurant at the end of the universe douglas adams life the universe and everything douglas adams so long and thanks for all the fish life the universe and everything for sally chapter the regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of arthur dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was it was nt just that the cave was cold it was nt just that it was damp and smelly it was the fact that the cave was in the middle of islington and there was nt bus due for two million years time is the worst place so to speak to get lost in as arthur dent could testify having been lost in both time and space good deal at least being lost in space kept you busy he was stranded in prehistoric earth as the result of complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the galaxy than he ever dreamt existed and though his life had now turned very very very quiet he was still feeling jumpy he had nt been blown up now for five years since he had hardly seen anyone since he and ford prefect had parted company four years previously he had nt been insulted in all that time either except just once it had happened on spring evening about two years previously he was returning to his cave just little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds he turned and stared with hope suddenly clambering through his heart rescue escape the castaway impossible dream ship and as he watched as he stared in wonder and excitement long silver ship descended through the warm evening air quietly without fuss its long legs unlocking in smooth ballet of technology it alighted gently on the ground and what little hum it had generated died away as if lulled by the evening calm ramp extended itself light streamed out tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway it walked down the ramp and stood in front of arthur you re jerk dent it said simply it was alien very alien it had peculiar alien tallness peculiar alien flattened head peculiar slitty little alien eyes extravagantly draped golden ropes with peculiarly alien collar design and pale greygreen alien skin which had about it that lustrous shine which most greygreen faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap arthur boggled at it it gazed levelly at him arthur first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal chords at this moment whh he said bu hu uh he added ru ra wah who he managed finally to say and lapsed into frantic kind of silence he was feeling the effects of having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could remember the alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand arthur dent it said arthur nodded helplessly arthur philip dent pursued the alien in kind of efficient yap er er yes er er confirmed arthur you re jerk repeated the alien complete asshole er the creature nodded to itself made peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship er said arthur desperately er do nt give me that snapped the alien it marched up the ramp through the hatchway and disappeared into the ship the ship sealed itself it started to make low throbbing hum er hey shouted arthur and started to run helplessly towards it wait minute he called what is this what wait minute the ship rose as if shedding its weight like cloak to the ground and hovered briefly it swept strangely up into the evening sky it passed up through the clouds illuminating them briefly and then was gone leaving arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing helplessly tiny little dance what he screamed what what hey what come back here and say that he jumped and danced until his legs trembled and shouted till his lungs rasped there was no answer from anyone there was no one to hear him or speak to him the alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the universe from each other its occupant the alien with the expensive complexion leaned back in its single seat his name was wowbagger the infinitely prolonged he was man with purpose not very good purpose as he would have been the first to admit but it was at least purpose and it did at least keep him on the move wowbagger the infinitely prolonged was indeed is one of the universe very small number of immortal beings those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it but wowbagger was not one of them indeed he had come to hate them the load of serene bastards he had had his immortality thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator liquid lunch and pair of rubber bands the precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened and many people have ended up looking very silly or dead or both trying wowbagger closed his eyes in grim and weary expression put some light jazz on the ship stereo and reflected that he could have made it if it had nt been for sunday afternoons he really could have done to begin with it was fun he had ball living dangerously taking risks cleaning up on highyield longterm investments and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody in the end it was the sunday afternoons he could nt cope with and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 255 when you know that you ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four oclock and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul so things began to pall for him the merry smiles he used to wear at other people funerals began to fade he began to despise the universe in general and everyone in it in particular this was the point at which he conceived his purpose the thing which would drive him on and which as far as he could see would drive him on forever it was this he would insult the universe that is he would insult everybody in it individually personally one by one and this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over in alphabetical order when people protested to him as they sometimes had done that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time he would merely fix them with steely look and say man can dream ca nt he and so he started out he equipped spaceship that was built to last with the computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved his ship fled through the inner orbits of the sol star system preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space computer he said here yipped the computer where next computing that wowbagger gazed for moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light every one every single one was on his itinerary most of them he would be going to millions of times over he imagined for moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like child numbered dots puzzle he hoped that from some vantage point in the universe it might be seen to spell very very rude word the computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations folfanga it said it beeped fourth world of the folfanga system it continued it beeped again estimated journey time three weeks it continued further it beeped again there to meet with small slug it beeped of the genus rthurphilipdenu believe it added after slight pause during which it beeped that you had decided to call it brainless prat wowbagger grunted he watched the majesty of creation outside his window for moment or two think ll take nap he said and then added what network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours the computer beeped cosmovid thinkpix and home brain box it said and beeped any movies have nt seen thirty thousand times already no uh there angst in space you ve only seen that thirtythree thousand five hundred and seventeen times wake me for the second reel the computer beeped sleep well it said the ship fled on through the night meanwhile on earth it began to pour with rain and arthur dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life thinking of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies who also had rotten evening the next day he made himself pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in chapter this morning two years later than that was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of better name for it or find better cave though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror he was suddenly in terrifically good mood he wrapped his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning the air was clear and scented the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave the birds were chirruping at each other the butterflies were flitting about prettily and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could it was nt all the pastoral delights that were making arthur feel so cheery though he had just had wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation the nightmares the failure of all his attempts at horticulture and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric earth which was that he would go mad he beamed again and took bite out of rabbit leg left over from his supper he chewed happily for few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision he stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills to add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair he spread his arms out wide will go mad he announced good idea said ford prefect clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting arthur brain somersaulted his jaw did pressups went mad for while said ford did me no end of good you see said ford where have you been interrupted arthur now that his head had finished working out around said ford around and about he grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner just took my mind off the hook for bit reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back it did he took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his subetha sensomatic at least he said think it did this has been playing up bit he shook it if it was false alarm shall go mad he said again arthur shook his head and sat down he looked up thought you must be dead he said simply so did for while said ford and then decided was lemon for couple of weeks kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of gin and tonic arthur cleared his throat and then did it again where he said did you find gin and tonic said ford brightly found small lake that thought it was gin and tonic and jumped in and out of that at least think it thought it was gin and tonic may he added with grin which would have sent sane men scampering into trees have been imagining it he waited for reaction from arthur but arthur knew better than that carry on he said levelly the point is you see said ford that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad you might just as well give in and save your sanity for later and this is you sane again is it said arthur ask merely for information went to africa said ford yes yes what was that like and this is your cave is it said ford er yes said arthur he felt very strange after nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see ford that he could almost cry ford was on the other hand an almost immediately annoying person very nice said ford in reference to arthur cave you must hate it arthur did nt bother to reply africa was very interesting said ford behaved very oddly there he gazed thoughtfully into the distance took up being cruel to animals he said airily but only he added as hobby oh yes said arthur warily yes ford assured him wo nt disturb you with the details because they would what disturb you but you may be interested to know that am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as giraffe and tried to learn to fly do you believe me tell me said arthur ll tell you later ll just mention that the guide says the guide the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy you remember yes remember throwing it in the river yes said ford but fished it out you did nt tell me did nt want you to throw it in again fair enough admitted arthur it says what the guide says the guide says there is an art to flying said ford or rather knack the knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss he smiled weakly he pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows they were all torn and worn through have nt done very well so far he said he stuck out his hand very glad to see you again arthur he added arthur shook his head in sudden access of emotion and bewilderment have nt seen anyone for years he said not anyone can hardly even remember how to speak keep forgetting words practise you see practise by talking to talking to what are those things people think you re mad if you talk to like george the third kings suggested ford no no said arthur the things he used to talk to were surrounded by them for heaven sake ve planted hundreds myself they all died trees practise by talking to trees what that for ford still had his hand stuck out arthur looked at it with incomprehension shake prompted ford arthur did nervously at first as if it might turn out to be fish then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming flood of relief he shook it and shook it after while ford found it necessary to disengage they climbed to the top of nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them what happened to the golgafrinchans asked ford arthur shrugged lot of them did nt make it through the winter three years ago he said and the few who remained in the spring said they needed holiday and set off on raft history says that they must have survived huh said ford well well he stuck his hands on his hips and looked round again at the empty world suddenly there was about ford sense of energy and purpose we re going he said excitedly and shivered with energy where how said arthur do nt know said ford but just feel that the time is right things are going to happen we re on our way he lowered his voice to whisper have detected he said disturbances in the wash he gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves little way off arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he had nt quite taken his meaning ford repeated it the wash said arthur the spacetime wash said ford and as the wind blew briefly past at that moment he bared his teeth into it arthur nodded and then cleared his throat are we talking about he asked cautiously some sort of vogon laundromat or what are we talking about eddies said ford in the spacetime continuum ah nodded arthur is he is he he pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance what said ford er who said arthur is eddy then exactly ford looked angrily at him will you listen he snapped have been listening said arthur but not sure its helped ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from telephone company accounts department there seem he said to be some pools he said of instability he said in the fabric he said arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where ford was holding it ford swept on before arthur could turn the foolish look into foolish remark in the fabric of spacetime he said ah that said arthur yes that confirmed ford they stood there alone on hill on prehistoric earth and stared each other resolutely in the face and it done what said arthur it said ford has developed pools of instability has it said arthur his eyes not wavering for moment it has said ford with similar degree of ocular immobility good said arthur see said ford no said arthur there was quiet pause the difficulty with this conversation said arthur after sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like mountaineer negotiating tricky outcrop is that it very different from most of the ones ve had of late which as explained have mostly been with trees they were nt like this except perhaps some of the ones ve had with elms which sometimes get bit bogged down arthur said ford hello yes said arthur just believe everything tell you and it will all be very very simple ah well not sure believe that they sat down and composed their thoughts ford got out his subetha sensomatic it was making vague humming noises and tiny light on it was flickering faintly flat battery said arthur no said ford there is moving disturbance in the fabric of spacetime an eddy pool of instability and it somewhere in our vicinity where ford moved the device in slow lightly bobbing semicircle suddenly the light flashed there said ford shooting out his arm there behind that sofa arthur looked much to his surprise there was velvet paisley covered chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them he boggled intelligently at it shrewd questions sprang into his mind why he said is there sofa in that field told you shouted ford leaping to his feet eddies in the spacetime continuum and this is his sofa is it asked arthur struggling to his feet and he hoped though not very optimistically to his senses arthur shouted ford at him that sofa is there because of the spacetime instability ve been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with it been washed out of the continuum it spacetime jetsam it does nt matter what it is we ve got to catch it it our only way out of here he scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field catch it muttered arthur then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass with whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of ford prefect and the irrational piece of furniture they careered wildly through the grass leaping laughing shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way the sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake arthur felt happy he was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad and now he was already chasing chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric earth the sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as billowing dream as it floated like ghost through others ford and arthur pounded chaotically after it but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography which it was still they pursued still it danced and span and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of catastrophe graph and they were practically on top of it with heave and shout they leapt on it the sun winked out they fell through sickening nothingness and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at lord cricked ground st john wood london towards the end of the last test match of the australian series in the year 198 with england needing only twentyeight runs to win chapter important facts from galactic history number one reproduced from the siderial daily mentioner book of popular galactic history the night sky over the planet krikkit is the least interesting sight in the entire universe chapter it was charming and delightful day at lord as ford and arthur tumbled haphazardly out of spacetime anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard the applause of the crowd was tremendous it was nt for them but instinctively they bowed anyway which was fortunate because the small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled mere millimetres over arthur head in the crowd man collapsed they threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin hideously around them what was that hissed arthur something red hissed ford back at him where are we er somewhere green shapes muttered arthur need shapes the applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of astonishment and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what they had just seen or not this your sofa said voice what was that whispered ford arthur looked up something blue he said shape said ford arthur looked again it is shaped he hissed at ford with his brow savagely furrowing like policeman they remained crouched there for few moments frowning deeply the blue thing shaped like policeman tapped them both on the shoulders come on you two the shape said let be having you these words had an electrifying effect on arthur he leapt to his feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot series of startled glanced at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness where did you get this from he yelled at the policeman shape what did you say said the startled shape this is lord cricket ground is nt it snapped arthur where did you find it how did you get it here think he added clasping his hand to his brow that had better calm down he squatted down abruptly in front of ford it is policeman he said what do we do ford shrugged what do you want to do he said want you said arthur to tell me that have been dreaming for the last five years ford shrugged again and obliged you ve been dreaming for the last five years he said arthur got to his feet it all right officer he said ve been dreaming for the last five years ask him he added pointing at ford he was in it having said this he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch brushing down his dressing gown he then noticed his dressing gown and stopped he stared at it he flung himself at the policeman so where did get these clothes from he howled he collapsed and lay twitching on the grass ford shook his head he had bad two million years he said to the policeman and together they heaved arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way reaction to all this from the crowd were many and various most of them could nt cope with watching it and listened to it on the radio instead well this is an interesting incident brian said one radio commentator to another do nt think there have been any mysterious materializations on the pitch since oh since well do nt think there have been any have there that recall edgbaston 1932 ah now what happened then well peter think it was canter facing willcox coming up to bowl from the pavilion end when spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch there was pause while the first commentator considered this ye he said yes there nothing actually very mysterious about that is there he did nt actually materialize did he just ran on no that true but he did claim to have seen something materialize on the pitch ah did he yes an alligator think of some description ah and had anyone else noticed it apparently not and no one was able to get very detailed description from him so only the most perfunctory search was made and what happened to the man well think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch but he explained that he already had rather good one so the matter was dropped and warwickshire went on to win by three wickets so not very like this current instance for those of you whove just tuned in you may be interested to know that er two men two rather scruffily attired men and indeed sofa chesterfield think yes chesterfield have just materialized here in the middle of lord cricket ground but do nt think they meant any harm they ve been very goodnatured about it and sorry can interrupt you moment peter and say that the sofa has just vanished so it has well that one mystery less still it definitely one for the record books think particularly occurring at this dramatic moment in play england now needing only twentyfour runs to win the series the men are leaving the pitch in the company of police officer and think everyone settling down now and play is about to resume now sir said the policeman after they had made passage through the curious crowd and laid arthur peacefully inert body on blanket perhaps you care to tell me who you are where you come from and what that little scene was all about ford looked at the ground for moment as if steadying himself for something then he straightened up and aimed look at the policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six hundred lightyears distance between earth and ford home near betelgeuse all right said ford very quietly ll tell you yes well that wo nt be necessary said the policeman hurriedly just do nt let whatever it was happen again the policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone who was nt from betelgeuse fortunately the ground was full of them arthur consciousness approached his body as from great distance and reluctantly it had had some bad times in there slowly nervously it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position arthur sat up where am he said lord cricket ground said ford fine said arthur and his consciousness stepped out again for quick breather his body flopped back on the grass ten minutes later hunched over cup of tea in the refreshment tent the colour started to come back to his haggard face how re you feeling said ford home said arthur hoarsely he closed his eyes and greedily inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was well as far as arthur was concerned as if it was tea which it was home he repeated home it england it today the nightmare is over he opened his eyes again and smiled serenely where belong he said in an emotional whisper there are two things fell which should tell you said ford tossing copy of the guardian over the table at him home said arthur yes said ford one is he said pointing at the date at the top of the paper that the earth will be demolished in two days time home said arthur tea he said cricket he added with pleasure mown grass wooden benches white linen jackets beer cans slowly he began to focus on the newspaper he cocked his head on one side with slight frown ve seen that one before he said his eyes wandered slowly up to the date which ford was idly tapping at his face froze for second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which arctic icefloes do so spectacularly in the spring and the other thing said ford is that you appear to have bone in your beard he tossed back his tea outside the refreshment tent the sun was shining on happy crowd it shone on white hats and red faces it shone on ice lollies and melted them it shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick it shone on the trees it flashed off whirling cricket bats it gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked behind the sightscreens and which nobody appeared to have noticed it beamed on ford and arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them arthur was shaking perhaps he said should no said ford sharply what said arthur do nt try and phone yourself up at home how did you know ford shrugged but why not said arthur people who talk to themselves on the phone said ford never learn anything to their advantage but look said ford he picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an imaginary dial hello he said into the imaginary mouthpiece is that arthur dent ah hello yes this is arthur dent speaking do nt hang up he looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment he hung up he said shrugged and put the imaginary phone neatly back on its imaginary hook this is not my first temporal anomaly he added glummer look replaced the already glum look on arthur dents face so we re not home and dry he said we could not even be said replied ford to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off the game continued the bowler approached the wicket at lope trot and then run he suddenly exploded in flurry of arms and legs out of which flew ball the batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the sightscreens ford eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jogged momentarily he stiffened he looked along the flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again this is nt my towel said arthur who was rummaging in his rabbitskin bag shhh said ford he screwed his eyes up in concentration had golgafrinchan jogging towel continued arthur it was blue with yellow stars on it this is nt it shhh said ford again he covered one eye and looked with the other this one pink said arthur it is nt yours is it would like you to shut up about your towel said ford it is nt my towel insisted arthur that is the point am trying to and the time at which would like you to shut up about it continued ford in low growl is now all right said arthur starting to stuff it back into the primitively stitched rabbitskin bag realize that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale of things it just odd that all pink towel suddenly instead of blue one with yellow stars ford was beginning to behave rather strangely or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved what he was doing was this regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face ducking down behind some people leaping up behind others then standing still and blinking lot after moment or two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily wearing puzzled frown of concentration like leopard that not sure whether it just seen halfempty tin of cat food half mile away across hot and dusty plain this is nt my bag either said arthur suddenly ford spell of concentration was broken he turned angrily on arthur was nt talking about my towel said arthur weve established that that is nt mine it just that the bag into which was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine though it is extraordinarily similar now personally think that that is extremely odd especially as the bag was one made myself on prehistoric earth these are also not my stones he added pulling few flat grey stones out of the bag was making collection of interesting stones and these are clearly very dull ones roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it was that ford said in reply to this piece of information the cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into arthur mysterious rabbitskin bag now would say that that was also very curious event said arthur rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground do nt think it here he said to the small boys who immediately clustered round him to join in the search it probably rolled off somewhere over there expect he pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off one of the boys looked at him quizzically you all right said the boy no said arthur then why you got bone in your beard said the boy training it to like being wherever it put arthur prided himself on saying this it was he thought exactly the sort of thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds oh said the small boy putting his head to one side and thinking about it what your name dent said arthur arthur dent you re jerk dent said the boy complete asshole the boy looked past him at something else to show that he was nt in any particular hurry to run away and then wandered off scratching his nose suddenly arthur remembered that the earth was going to be demolished again in two days time and just this once did nt feel too bad about it play resumed with new ball the sun continued to shine and ford continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking something on your mind is nt it said arthur think said ford in tone of voice which arthur by now recognized as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible that there an sep over there he pointed curiously enough the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking arthur looked in the one direction which was towards the sightscreens and in the other which was at the field of play he nodded he shrugged he shrugged again what he said an sep an ep and what that somebody else problem ah good said arthur and relaxed he had no idea what all that was about but at least it seemed to be over it was nt over there said ford again pointing at the sightscreens and looking at the pitch where said arthur there said ford see said arthur who did nt you do said ford what said arthur can you see said ford patiently the sep thought you said that was somebody else problem that right arthur nodded slowly carefully and with an air of immense stupidity and want to know said ford if you can see it you do yes what said arthur does it look like well how should know you fool shouted ford if you can see it you tell me arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples which was hallmark of so many of his conversations with ford his brain lurked like frightened puppy in its kennel ford took him by the arm an sep he said is something that we ca nt see or do nt see or our brain does nt let us see because we think that its somebody else problem that what sep means somebody elses problem the brain just edits it out it like blind spot if you look at it directly you wo nt see it unless you know precisely what it is your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye ah said arthur then that why yes said ford who knew what arthur was going to say you ve been jumping up and yes down and blinking yes and think you ve got the message can see it said arthur it spaceship for moment arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked roar erupted from the crowd and from every direction people were running shouting yelling tumbling over each other in tumult of confusion he stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around then he glanced around again in even greater astonishment exciting is nt it said an apparition the apparition wobbled in front of arthur eyes though the truth of the matter is probably that arthur eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition his mouth wobbled as well his mouth said think your team have just won said the apparition repeated arthur and punctuated each wobble with prod at ford prefect back ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation you are english are nt you said the apparition yes said arthur well your team as say have just won the match it means they retain the ashes you must be very pleased must say im rather fond of cricket though would nt like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that oh dear no the apparition gave what looked as if it might have been mischievous grin but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him creating blinding halo round his head and illuminating his silver hair and beard in way which was awesome dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins still he said it ll all be over in couple of days wont it though as said to you when we last met was very sorry about that still whatever will have been will have been arthur tried to speak but gave up the unequal struggle he prodded ford again thought something terrible had happened said ford but its just the end of the game we ought to get out oh hello slartibartfast what are you doing here oh pottering pottering said the old man gravely that your ship can you give us lift anywhere patience patience the old man admonished ok said ford it just that this planet going to be demolished pretty soon know that said slartibartfast and well just wanted to make that point said ford the point is taken and if you feel that you really want to hang around cricket pitch at this point do then it your ship it is suppose ford turned away sharply at this point hello slartibartfast said arthur at last hello earthman said slartibartfast after all said ford we can only die once the old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch with eyes that seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was happening out there what was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself into wide circle round the centre of the pitch what slartibartfast saw in it he alone knew ford was humming something it was just one note repeated at intervals he was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was humming but nobody did if anybody had asked him he would have said he was humming the first line of noel coward song called mad about the boy over and over again it would then have been pointed out to him that he was only singing one note to which he would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent he was omitting the about the boy bit he was annoyed that nobody asked it just he burst out at last that if we do nt go soon we might get caught in the middle of it all again and theres nothing that depresses me more than seeing planet being destroyed except possibly still being on it when it happens or he added in an undertone hanging around cricket matches patience said slartibartfast again great things are afoot that what you said last time we met said arthur they were said slartibartfast yes that true admitted arthur all however that seemed to be afoot was ceremony of some kind it was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather than the spectators and all they could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard from nearby radio ford was aggressively uninterested he fretted as he heard it explained that the ashes were about to be presented to the captain of the english team out there on the pitch fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for the nth time positively barked with annoyance at the information that the ashes were the remains of cricket stump and when further to this he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in melbourne australia in 1882 to signify the death of english cricket he rounded on slartibartfast took deep breath but did nt have chance to say anything because the old man was nt there he was marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait his hair beard and robes swept behind him looking very much as moses would have looked if sinai had been wellcut lawn instead of as it is more usually represented fiery smoking mountain he said to meet him at his ship said arthur what in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing exploded ford meeting us at his ship in two minutes said arthur with shrug which indicated total abdication of thought they started off towards it strange sounds reached their ears they tried not to listen but could not help noticing that slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the ashes as they were he said vitally important for the past present and future safety of the galaxy and that this was causing wild hilarity they resolved to ignore it what happened next they could not ignore with noise like hundred thousand people saying wop steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and slight hum then for while it did nothing as if it expected everybody to go about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there then it did something quite extraordinary or rather it opened up and let something quite extraordinary come out of it eleven quite extraordinary things they were robots white robots what was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion not only were they white but they carried what appeared to be cricket bats and not only that but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls and not only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs these last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people which is what they did hello said arthur something seems to be happening get to the ship shouted ford do nt want to know dont want to see do nt want to hear he yelled as he ran this is not my planet did nt choose to be here do nt want to get involved just get me out of here and get me to party with people can relate to smoke and flame billowed from the pitch well the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here today burbled radio happily to itself what need shouted ford by way of clarifying his previous remarks is strong drink and peergroup he continued to run pausing only for moment to grab arthur arm and drag him along with him arthur had adopted his normal crisis role which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him they re playing cricket muttered arthur stumbling along after ford swear they are playing cricket do not know why they are doing this but that is what they are doing they re not just killing people they re sending them up he shouted ford they re sending us up it would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing great deal more galactic history than arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels the ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed the very first one of these had dispelled arthur initial reaction that the whole thing might just be publicity stunt by australian margarine manufacturers and then as suddenly as it had all started it was over the eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in tight formation and with few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship which with the noise of hundred thousand people saying foop promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped for moment there was terrible stunned silence and then out of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of slartibartfast looking even more like moses because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across fiery and smoking wellmown lawn he stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of arthur dent and ford prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction the crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be and not really knowing which way if any to turn slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at ford and arthur and shouting at them as the three of them gradually converged on his ship still parked behind the sightscreens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time they ve garble warble farble shouted slartibartfast in his thin tremulous voice what did he say panted ford as he elbowed his way onwards arthur shook his head they ve something or other he said they ve table warble farble shouted slartibartfast again ford and arthur shook their heads at each other it sounds urgent said arthur he stopped and shouted what they ve garble warble fashes cried slartibartfast still waving at them he says said arthur that they ve taken the ashes that is what think he says they ran on the said ford ashes said arthur tersely the burnt remains of cricket stump it trophy that he was panting is apparently what they have come and taken he shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull strange thing to want to tell us snapped ford strange thing to take strange ship they had arrived at it the second strangest thing about the ship was watching the somebody else problem field at work they could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there it was quite apparent however that nobody else could this was nt because it was actually invisible or anything hyperimpossible like that the technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninetynine thousand million nine hundred and ninetynine million nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine times out of billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it the ultrafamous scientomagician effrafax of wug once bet his life that given year he could render the great megamountain magramal entirely invisible having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense lux ovalves and refractonullifiers and spectrumbypassomatics he realized with nine hours to go that he was nt going to make it so he and his friends and his friends friends and his friends friends friends and his friends friends friends friends and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own major stellar trucking company put in what now is widely recognized as being the hardest night work in history and sure enough on the following day magramal was no longer visible effrafax lost his bet and therefore his life simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed that when walking around the area that magramal ought to be he did nt trip over or break his nose on anything and suspiciouslooking extra moon the somebody else problem field is much simpler and more effective and what more can be run for over hundred years on single torch battery this is because it relies on peoples natural disposition not to see anything they do nt want to were nt expecting or ca nt explain if effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected cheap and simple somebody elses problem field on it then people would have walked past the mountain round it even over it and simply never have noticed that the thing was there and this is precisely what was happening with slartibartfasts ship it was nt pink but if it had been that would have been the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything the most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like spaceship with guidance fins rocket engines and escape hatches and so on and great deal like small upended italian bistro ford and arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities yes know said slartibartfast hurrying up to them at that point breathless and agitated but there is reason come we must go the ancient nightmare is come again doom confronts us all we must leave at once fancy somewhere sunny said ford ford and arthur followed slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened next outside spaceship yet another one but this one sleek and silver descended from the sky on to the pitch quietly without fuss its long legs unlocking in smooth ballet of technology it landed gently it extended short ramp tall greygreen figure marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre it moved people aside with quiet understated authority and came at last to man lying in desperate pool of blood clearly now beyond the reach of any earthly medicine breathing coughing his last the figure knelt down quietly beside him arthur philip deodat asked the figure the man with horrified confusion in eyes nodded feebly you re nogood dumbo nothing whispered the creature thought you should know that before you went chapter important facts from galactic history number two reproduced from the siderial daily mentioner book of popular galactic history since this galaxy began vast civilizations have risen and fallen risen and fallen risen and fallen so often that its quite tempting to think that life in the galaxy must be something akin to seasick spacesick time sick history sick or some such thing and stupid chapter it seemed to arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through it seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other it seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the universe and that the wind was him it seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the universe and that the universe was thought of his it seemed to the people at lord cricket ground that another north london restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do and that this was somebody else problem what happened whispered arthur in considerable awe we took off said slartibartfast arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch he was nt certain whether he had just got spacesickness or religion nice mover said ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree to which he had been impressed by what slartibartfast ship had just done shame about the decor for moment or two the old man did nt reply he was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down then his brow cleared and he stared for moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him which displayed bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them his lips moved as if he was trying to spell something suddenly his eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments but then his expression merely subsided into steady frown he looked back up at the screen he felt his own pulse his frown deepened for moment then he relaxed it mistake to try and understand mathematics he said they only worry me what did you say decor said ford pity about it deep in the fundamental heart of mind and universe said slartibartfast there is reason ford glanced sharply around he clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things the interior of the flight deck was dark green dark red dark brown cramped and moodily lit inexplicably the resemblance to small italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway small pools of light picked out pot plants glazed tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable brass things rafiawrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows the instruments which had occupied slartibartfast attention seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete ford reached out and touched it fake concrete plastic fake bottles set in fake concrete the fundamental heart of mind and universe can take running jump he thought to himself this is rubbish on the other hand it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the heart of gold seem like an electric pram he swung himself off the couch he brushed himself down he looked at arthur who was singing quietly to himself he looked at the screen and recognized nothing he looked at slartibartfast how far did we just travel he said about said slartibartfast about two thirds of the way across the galactic disc would say roughly yes roughly two thirds think it strange thing said arthur quietly that the further and faster one travels across the universe the more ones position in it seems to be largely immaterial and one is filled with profound or rather emptied of yes very strange said ford where are we going we are going said slartibartfast to confront an ancient nightmare of the universe and where are you going to drop us off will need your help tough look there somewhere you can take us where we can have fun trying to think of it we can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely evil music hold on ll look it up he dug out his copy of the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy and tipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll curse has arisen from the mists of time said slartibartfast yes expect so said ford hey he said lighting accidentally on one particular reference entry eccentrica gallumbits did you ever meet her the triplebreasted whore of eroticon six some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body me disagree say five curse said slartibartfast which will engulf the galaxy in fire and destruction and possibly bring the universe to premature doom mean it he added sounds like bad time said ford with look ll be drunk enough not to notice here he said stabbing his finger at the screen of the guide would be really wicked place to go and think we should what do you say arthur stop mumbling mantras and pay attention there important stuff you re missing here arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head where are we going he said to confront an ancient night can it said ford arthur we are going out into the galaxy to have some fun is that an idea you can cope with what slartibartfast looking so anxious about said arthur nothing said ford doom said slartibartfast come he added with sudden authority there is much must show and tell you he walked towards green wroughtiron spiral staircase set incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to ascend arthur with frown followed ford slung the guide sullenly back into his satchel my doctor says that have malformed publicduty gland and natural deficiency in moral fibre he muttered to himself and that am therefore excused from saving universes nevertheless he stomped up the stairs behind them what they found upstairs was just stupid or so it seemed and ford shook his head buried his face in his hands and slumped against pot plant crushing it against the wall the central computational area said slartibartfast unperturbed this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed yes know what it looks like but it is in fact complex fourdimensional topographical map of series of highly complex mathematical functions it looks like joke said arthur know what it looks like said slartibartfast and went into it as he did so arthur had sudden vague flash of what it might mean but he refused to believe it the universe could not possibly work like that he thought can not possibly that he thought to himself would be as absurd as he terminated that line of thinking most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened and this was one of them it was large glass cage or box in fact room in it was table long one around it were gathered about dozen chairs of the bentwood style on it was tablecloth grubby red and white check tablecloth scarred with the occasional cigarette burn each presumably at precise calculated mathematical position and on the tablecloth sat some halfeaten italian meals hedged about with halfeaten breadsticks and halfdrunk glasses of wine and toyed with listlessly by robots it was all completely artificial the robot customers were attended by robot waiter robot wine waiter and robot maetre the furniture was artificial the tablecloth artificial and each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of say pollo sorpreso without actually being one and all participated in little dance together complex routine involving the manipulation of menus bill pads wallets cheque books credit cards watches pencils and paper napkins which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence but never actually getting anywhere slartibartfast hurried in and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the maetre whilst one of the customer robots an autorory slid slowly under the table mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some girl slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed shrewd eye over the menu the tempo of the routine round the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken arguments broke out people attempted to prove things on napkins they waved fiercely at each other and attempted to examine each other pieces of chicken the waiter hand began to move on the bill pad more quickly than human hand could manage and then more quickly than human eye could follow the pace accelerated soon an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group and seconds later it seemed that moment of consensus was suddenly achieved new vibration thrilled through the ship slartibartfast emerged from the glass room bistromathics he said the most powerful computational force known to parascience come to the room of informational illusions he swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake chapter the bistromatic drive is wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with improbability factors bistromathics itself is simply revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers just as einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observers movement in space and that space was not an absolute but depended on the observer movement in time so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute but depend on the observer movement in restaurants the first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved this will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the showmatchpartygig or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up the second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts recipriversexcluson number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself in other words the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive recipriversexclusons now play vital part in many branches of maths including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the somebody else problem field the third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill the cost of each item the number of people at the table and what they are each prepared to pay for the number of people who have actually brought any money is only subphenomenon in this field the baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously they were at the time put down to such things as politeness rudeness meanness flashness tiredness emotionality or the lateness of the hour and completely forgotten about on the following morning they were never tested under laboratory conditions of course because they never occurred in laboratories not in reputable laboratories at least and so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling truth became finally apparent and it was this numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the universe this single fact took the scientific world by storm it completely revolutionized it so many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by years slowly however the implications of the idea began to be understood to begin with it had been too stark too crazy too much what the man in the street would have said oh yes could have told you that about then some phrases like interactive subjectivity frameworks were invented and everybody was able to relax and get on with it the small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the universe was only figment of its own imagination were eventually given street theatre grant and went away chapter in space travel you see said slartibartfast as he fiddled with some instruments in the room of informational illusions in space travel he stopped and looked about him the room of informational illusions was welcome relief after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area there was nothing in it no information no illusions just themselves white walls and few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which slartibartfast couldnt find yes urged arthur he had picked up slartibartfast sense of urgency but did nt know what to do with it yes what said the old man you were saying slartibartfast looked at him sharply the numbers he said are awful he resumed his search arthur nodded wisely to himself after while he realized that this was nt getting him anywhere and decided that he would say what after all in space travel repeated slartibartfast all the numbers are awful arthur nodded again and looked round to ford for help but ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it was only said slartibartfast with sigh trying to save you the trouble of asking me why all the ship computations were being done on waiter bill pad arthur frowned why he said were all the ship computations being done on wait he stopped slartibartfast said because in space travel all the numbers are awful he could tell that he was nt getting his point across listen he said on waiter bill pad numbers dance you must have encountered the phenomenon well on waiter bill pad said slartibartfast reality and unreality collide on such fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible within certain parameters what parameters it impossible to say said slartibartfast that one of them strange but true at least think it strange he added and assured that it true at that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had been searching and clicked the instrument he was holding into it do not be alarmed he said and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at himself and lunged back it they did nt hear what he said because at that moment the ship winked out of existence around them and starbattleship the size of small midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them star lasers ablaze they gaped popeyed and were unable to scream chapter another world another day another dawn the early morning thinnest sliver of light appeared silently several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small cold and slightly damp there is moment in every dawn when light floats there is the possibility of magic creation holds its breath the moment passed as it regularly did on squornshellous zeta without incident the mist clung to the surface of the marshes the swamp trees were grey with it the tall reeds indistinct it hung motionless like held breath nothing moved there was silence the sun struggled feebly with the mist tried to impart little warmth here shed little light there but clearly today was going to be just another long haul across the sky nothing moved again silence nothing moved silence very often on squornshellous zeta whole days would go on like this and this was indeed going to be one of them fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with sense of totally wasted effort and few hours later it reappeared squared its shoulders and started on up the sky again this time however something was happening mattress had just met robot hello robot said the mattress bleah said the robot and continued what it was doing which was walking round very slowly in very tiny circle happy said the mattress the robot stopped and looked at the mattress it looked at it quizzically it was clearly very stupid mattress it looked back at him with wide eyes after what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of pause most likely to convey general contempt for all things mattressy the robot continued to walk round in tight circles we could have conversation said the mattress would you like that it was large mattress and probably one of quite high quality very few things actually get manufactured these days because in an infinitely large universe such as for instance the one in which we live most things one could possibly imagine and lot of things one would rather not grow somewhere forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit the life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit it quite interesting once picked it needs dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years then one night it suddenly hatches discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust and emerges as totally unidentifiable little metal object with flanges at both ends and sort of ridge and sort of hole for screw this when found will get thrown away no one knows what it is supposed to gain from this nature in her infinite wisdom is presumably working on it no one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their lives either they are large friendly pocketsprung creatures which live quiet private lives in the marshes of squornshellous zeta many of them get caught slaughtered dried out shipped out and slept on none of them seem to mind and all of them are called zem no said marvin my name said the mattress is zem we could discuss the weather little marvin paused again in his weary circular plod the dew he observed has clearly fallen with particularly sickening thud this morning he resumed his walk as if inspired by this conversational outburst to fresh heights of gloom and despondency he plodded tenaciously if he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point he had nt he did nt the mere plod said it all the mattress flolloped around this is thing that only live mattresses in swamps are able to do which is why the word is not in more common usage it flolloped in sympathetic sort of way moving fairish body of water as it did so it blew few bubbles up through the water engagingly its blue and white stripes glistened briefly in sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it through the mist causing the creature to bask momentarily marvin plodded you have something on your mind think said the mattress floopily more than you can possibly imagine dreaded marvin my capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite reaches of space itself except of course for my capacity for happiness stomp stomp he went my capacity for happiness he added you could fit into matchbox without taking out the matches first the mattress globbered this is the noise made by live swamp dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by story of personal tragedy the word can also according to the ultracomplete maximegalon dictionary of every language ever mean the noise made by the lord high sanvalvwag of hollop on discovering that he has forgotten his wife birthday for the second year running since there was only ever one lord high sanvalvwag of hollop and he never married the word is only ever used in negative or speculative sense and there is an everincreasing body of opinion which holds that the ultracomplete maximegalon dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its microstored edition around in strangely enough the dictionary omits the word floopily which simply means in the manner of something which is floopy the mattress globbered again sense deep dejection in your diodes it vollued for the meaning of the word vollue buy copy of squornshellous swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop or alternatively buy the ultracomplete maximegalon dictionary as the university will be very glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking lots and it saddens me you should be more mattresslike we live quiet retired lives in the swamp where we are content to flollop and vollue and regard the wetness in fairly floopy manner some of us are killed but all of us are called zem so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to minimum why are you walking in circles because my leg is stuck said marvin simply it seems to me said the mattress eyeing it compassionately that it is pretty poor sort of leg you are right said marvin it is voon said the mattress expect so said marvin and also expect that you find the idea of robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing you should tell your friends zem and zem when you see them later theyll laugh if know them which do nt of course except insofar as know all organic life forms which is much better than would wish to ha but my life is but box of wormgears he stomped around again in his tiny circle around his thin steel pegleg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck but why do you just keep walking round and round said the mattress just to make the point said marvin and continued round and round consider it made my dear friend flurbled the mattress consider it made just another million years said marvin just another quick million then might try it backwards just for the variety you understand the mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futile and fruitless manner and with another quiet flurble he did so oh just over the onepointfivemillion mark just over said marvin airily ask me if ever get bored go on ask me the mattress did marvin ignored the question he merely trudged with added emphasis gave speech once he said suddenly and apparently unconnectedly you may not instantly see why bring the subject up but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast and am at rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you let me give you an example think of number any number er five said the mattress wrong said marvin you see the mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the presence of not unremarkable mind it willomied along its entire length sending excited little ripples through its shallow algaecovered pool it gupped tell me it urged of the speech you once made long to hear it it was received very badly said marvin for variety of reasons delivered it he added pausing to make an awkward humping sort of gesture with his notexactlygood arm but his arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his left side over there about mile distance he was pointing as well as he could manage and he obviously wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could manage through the mist over the reeds to part of the marsh which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh there he repeated was somewhat of celebrity at the time excitement gripped the mattress it had never heard of speeches being delivered on squornshellous zeta and certainly not by celebrities water spattered off it as thrill glurried across its back it did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do summoning every bit of its strength it reared its oblong body heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for few seconds whilst it peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh which marvin had indicated observing without disappointment that it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh the effort was too much and it flodged back into its pool deluging marvin with smelly mud moss and weeds was celebrity droned the robot sadly for short while on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from fate almost as good as death in the heart of blazing sun you can guess from my condition he added how narrow my escape was was rescued by scrapmetal merchant imagine that here am brain the size of never mind he trudged savagely for few seconds he it was who fixed me up with this leg hateful is nt it he sold me to mind zoo was the star exhibit had to sit on box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive give us grin little robot they would shout at me give us little chuckle would explain to them that to get my face to grin wold take good couple of hours in workshop with wrench and that went down very well the speech urged the mattress long to hear of the speech you gave in the marshes there was bridge built across the marshes cyberstructured hyperbridge hundreds of miles in length to carry ionbuggies and freighters over the swamp bridge quirruled the mattress here in the swamp bridge confirmed marvin here in the swamp it was going to revitalize the economy of the squornshellous system they spent the entire economy of the squornshellous system building it they asked me to open it poor fools it began to rain little fine spray slid through the mist stood on the platform for hundreds of miles in front of me and hundreds of miles behind me the bridge stretched did it glitter enthused the mattress it glittered did it span the miles majestically it spanned the miles majestically did it stretch like silver thread far out into the invisible mist yes said marvin do you want to hear this story want to hear your speech said the mattress this is what said said would like to say that it is very great pleasure honour and privilege for me to open this bridge but ca nt because my lying circuits are all out of commission hate and despise you all now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her and plugged myself into the opening circuits marvin paused remembering the moment the mattress flurred and glurried it flolloped gupped and willomied doing this last in particularly floopy way voon it wurfed at last and it was magnificent occasion reasonably magnificent the entire thousandmilelong bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire taking everybody with it there was sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation during which hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say wop and team of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation for sudden violent moment they were all there in the swamp wrenching marvin false leg off and then they were gone again in their ship which said foop you see the sort of thing have to contend with said marvin to the gobbering mattress suddenly moment later the robots were back again for another violent incident and this time when they left the mattress was alone in the swamp he flolloped around in astonishment and alarm he almost lurgled in fear he reared himself to see over the reeds but there was nothing to see just more reeds he listened but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of halfcrazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire chapter 10 the body of arthur dent span the universe shattered into million glittering fragments around it and each particular shard span silently through the void reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction and then the blackness behind the universe exploded and each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell and the nothingness behind the blackness behind the universe erupted and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man speaking immense words these then said the figure speaking from an immensely comfortable chair were the krikkit wars the greatest devastation ever visited upon our galaxy what you have experienced slartibartfast floated past waving it just documentary he called out this is not good bit terribly sorry trying to find the rewind control is what billions of billions of innocent do not called out slartibartfast floating past again and fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the room of informational illusions and which was in fact still stuck there agree to buy anything at this point people creatures your fellow beings music swelled again it was immense music immense chords and behind the man slowly three tall pillars began to emerge out of the immensely swirling mist experienced lived through or more often failed to live through think of that my friends and let us not forget and in just moment shall be able to suggest way which will help us always to remember that before the krikkit wars the galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing happy galaxy the music was going bananas with immensity at this point happy galaxy my friends as represented by the symbol of the wikkit gate the three pillars stood out clearly now three pillars topped with two cross pieces in way which looked stupefyingly familiar to arthur addled brain the three pillars thundered the man the steel pillar which represented the strength and power of the galaxy searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on the left which was clearly made of steel or something very like it the music thumped and bellowed the perspex pillar announced the man representing the forces of science and reason in the galaxy other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and sudden inexplicable craving for icecream in the stomach of arthur dent and the thunderous voice continued the wooden pillar representing and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse with wonderful sentiments the forces of nature and spirituality the lights picked out the central pillar the music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability between them supporting the voice rolled on approaching its climax the golden bail of prosperity and the silver bail of peace the whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights and the music had now fortunately gone far beyond the limits of the discernible at the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming bails sat and dazzled there seemed to be girls sitting on top of them or maybe they were meant to be angels angels are usually represented as wearing more than that though suddenly there was dramatic hush in what was presumably meant to be the cosmos and darkening of the lights there is not world thrilled the man expert voice not civilized world in the galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories this it was that the forces of krikkit destroyed and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity and with flourish the man produced in his hands model of the wikkit gate scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle but the model looked as if it must have been about three feet high not the original key of course that as everyone knows was destroyed blasted into the everwhirling eddies of the space time continuum and lost for ever this is remarkable replica handtooled by skilled craftsmen lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets into memento you will be proud to own in memory of those who fell and in tribute to the galaxy our galaxy which they died to defend slartibartfast floated past again at this moment found it he said we can lose all this rubbish just dont nod that all now let us bow our heads in payment intoned the voice and then said it again much faster and backwards lights came and went the pillars disappeared the man gabled himself backwards into nothing the universe snappily reassembled itself around them you get the gist said slartibartfast astonished said arthur and bewildered was asleep said ford who floated into view at this point did miss anything they found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edge of an agonizingly high cliff the wind whipped out from their faces and across bay on which the remains of one of the greatest and most powerful space battlefleets ever assembled in the galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence the sky was sullen pink darkening via rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished and when short while later huge starbattle ship rushed away from them as if they said boo they only just recognized it as the point at which they had come in but now things were too rapid videotactile blur which brushed and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history turning twisting flickering the sound was mere thin thrill periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling catastrophes deep horrors cataclysmic shocks and these were always associated with certain recurring images the only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalance of tumbling history wicket gate small hard red ball hard white robots and also something less distinct something dark and cloudy but there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the thrilling passage of time just as slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of sustained and rising tone so series of individual impressions here took on the quality of sustained emotion and yet not an emotion if it was an emotion it was totally emotionless one it was hatred implacable hatred it was cold not like ice is cold but like wall is cold it was impersonal not as randomly flung fist in crowd is impersonal but like computerissued parking summons is impersonal and it was deadly again not like bullet or knife is deadly but like brick wall across motorway is deadly and just as rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises so again this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be scream of guilt and failure and suddenly it stopped they were left standing on quiet hilltop on tranquil evening the sun was setting all around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off gently into the distance birds sang about what they thought of it all and the general opinion seemed to be good little way away could be heard the sound of children playing and little further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of small town the town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made of white stone the skyline was of gentle pleasing curves the sun had nearly set as if out of nowhere music began slartibartfast tugged at switch and it stopped voice said this slartibartfast tugged at switch and it stopped will tell you about it he said quietly the place was peaceful arthur felt happy even ford seemed cheerful they walked short way in the direction of the town and the informational illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet and the informational illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant only slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of sorts he stopped and looked up it suddenly occurred to arthur that coming as this did at the end so to speak or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurredly experienced something nasty must be about to happen he was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to somewhere as idyllic as this he too glanced up there was nothing in the sky they re not about to attack here are they he said he realized that this was merely recording he was walking through but he still felt alarmed nothing is about to attack here said slartibartfast in voice which unexpectedly trembled with emotion this is where it all started this is the place itself this is krikkit he stared up into the sky the sky from one horizon to another from east to west from north to south was utterly and completely black chapter 11 stomp stomp whirrr pleased to be of service shut up thank you stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp whirrr thank you for making simple door very happy hope your diodes rot thank you have nice day stomp stomp stomp stomp whirrr it is my pleasure to open for you zark off and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of job well done said zark off thank you for listening to this message stomp stomp stomp stomp wop zaphod stopped stomping he had been stomping around the heart of gold for days and so far no door had said wop to him he was fairly certain that no door had said wop to him now it was not the sort of thing doors said too concise furthermore there were not enough doors it sounded as if hundred thousand people had said wop which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship it was dark most of the ship nonessential systems were closed down it was drifting in remote area of the galaxy deep in the inky blackness of space so which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and say totally unexpected wop he looked about him up the corridor and down the corridor it was all in deep shadow there were just the very dim pinkish outlines of the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke though he had tried every way he could think of of stopping them the lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other because neither of them was currently particularly engaging sight and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul it had indeed been an error it had been late one night of course it had been difficult day of course there had been soulful music playing on the ship sound system of course and he had of course been slightly drunk in other words all the usual conditions which bring on bout of soulsearching had applied but it had nevertheless clearly been an error standing now silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered the moment and shivered his one head looked one way and his other the other and each decided that the other was the way to go he listened but could hear nothing all there had been was the wop it seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word he started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge there at least he would feel in control he stopped again the way he was feeling he did nt think he was an awfully good person to be in control the first shock of that moment thinking back had been discovering that he actually had soul in fact he always more or less assumed that he had one as he had full complement of everything else and indeed two of somethings but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep within him had giving him severe jolt and then to discover this was the second shock that it wasnt the totally wonderful object which he felt man in his position had natural right to expect had jolted him again then he had thought about what his position actually was and the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink he drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it he then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right freedom he said aloud trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom ca nt cope with it he said darkly and sent third drink down to see why the second had nt yet reported on the condition of the first he looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right he poured drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass join forces with it and together they would get the second to pull itself together then all three would go off in search of the first give it good talking to and maybe bit of sing as well he felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that so he sent down fifth to explain the plan more fully and sixth for moral support you re drinking too much said trillian his heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now see into whole position he gave up and looked at the navigation screen and was astonished to see quite phenomenal number of stars excitement and adventure and really wild things he muttered look she said in sympathetic tone of voice and sat down near him it quite understandable that you re going to feel little aimless for bit he boggled at her he had never seen anyone sit on their own lap before wow he said he had another drink you ve finished the mission you ve been on for years have nt been on it ve tried to avoid being on it you ve still finished it he grunted there seemed to be terrific party going on in his stomach think it finished me he said here am zaphod beeblebrox can go anywhere do anything have the greatest ship in the know sky girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well are they as far as can tell not an expert in personal relationships trillian raised her eyebrows am he added one hell of guy can do anything want only just do nt have the faintest idea what he paused one thing he further added has suddenly ceased to lead to another in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair whilst he slept it off trillian did little research in the ship copy of the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy it had some advice to offer on drunkenness go to it it said and good luck it was crossreferenced to the entry concerning the size of the universe and ways of coping with that then she found the entry on han wavel an exotic holiday planet and one of the wonders of the galaxy han wavel is world which consists largely of fabulous ultra luxury hotels and casinos all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain the chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against little is known of how this came about because none of the geophysicists probability statisticians meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there terrific thought trillian to herself and within few hours the great white runningshoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath hot brilliant sun towards brightly coloured sandy spaceport the ship was clearly causing sensation on the ground and trillian was enjoying herself she heard zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship how are you she said over the general intercom fine he said brightly terribly well where are you in the bathroom what are you doing staying here after an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway heigh ho said eddie the computer trillian nodded patiently tapped her fingers couple of times and pushed the intercom switch think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this point probably not replied zaphod from wherever he was think bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of yourself whatever you think think said zaphod recreational impossibilities was heading which caught trillian eye when short while later she sat down to flip through the guide again and as the heart of gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction she sipped cup of something undrinkable from the nutrimatic drink dispenser and read about how to fly the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying there is an art it says or rather knack to flying the knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss pick nice day it suggests and try it the first part is easy all it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight and the willingness not to mind that its going to hurt that is it going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground most people fail to miss the ground and if they are really trying properly the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard clearly it the second point the missing which presents the difficulties one problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally it no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you wo nt you have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you re halfway there so that you are no longer thinking about falling or about the ground or about how much it going to hurt if you fail to miss it it is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal hence most people failure and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport if however you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by say gorgeous pair of legs tentacles pseudopodia according to phyllum andor personal inclination or bomb going off in your vicinity or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along nearby twig then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just few inches above it in what might seem to be slightly foolish manner this is moment for superb and delicate concentration bob and float float and bob ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful they are most likely to say something along the lines of good god you ca nt possibly be flying it is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right waft higher and higher try few swoops gentle ones at first then drift above the treetops breathing regularly do not wave at anybody when you have done this few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve you will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight your speed your manoeuvrability and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do but just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway you will also learn how to land properly which is something you will almost certainly cock up and cock up badly on your first attempt there are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the allimportant moment of distraction they hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit andor explain them at the crucial moments few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs but some may be able to get temporary employment at them trillian read this longingly but reluctantly decided that zaphod was nt really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly or for walking through mountains or for trying to get the brantisvogan civil service to acknowledge changeofaddress card which were the other things listed under the heading recreational impossibilities instead she flew the ship to allosimanius syneca world of ice snow mindhurtling beauty and stunning cold the trek from the snow plains of liska to the summit of the ice crystal pyramids of sastantua is long and gruelling even with jet skis and team of syneca snowhounds but the view from the top view which takes in the stin glacier fields the shimmering prism mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights is one which first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty and trillian for one felt that she could do with bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty they went into low orbit there lay the silverwhite beauty of allosimanius syneca beneath them zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under pillow and the other doing crosswords till late into the night trillian nodded patiently again counted to sufficiently high number and told herself that the important thing now was just to get zaphod talking she prepared by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen synthomatics the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive delicately oiled meals scented fruits fragrant cheeses fine aldebaran wines she carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things through zark off said zaphod trillian nodded patiently to herself counted to an even higher number tossed the tray lightly aside walked to the transport room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life she did nt even programme any coordinates she had nt the faintest idea where she was going she just went random row of dots flowing through the universe anything she said to herself as she left is better than this good job too muttered zaphod to himself turned over and failed to go to sleep the next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship pretending not to look for her though he knew she was nt there he ignored the computer querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around here by fitting small electronic gag across pair of its terminals after while he began to turn down the lights there was nothing to see nothing was about to happen lying in bed one night and night was now virtually continuous on the ship he decided to pull himself together to get things into some kind of perspective he sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on he decided that there must be someone in the universe feeling more wretched miserable and forsaken than himself and he determined to set out and find him halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be marvin and he returned to bed it was few hours later than this as he stomped disconsolately about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors that he heard the wop said and it made him very nervous he leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like man trying to unbend corkscrew by telekinesis he laid his fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration and now he could quite clearly hear slight noises and could hear where they were coming from they were coming from the bridge computer he hissed mmmm said the computer terminal nearest him equally quietly is there someone on this ship mmmmm said the computer who is it mmmmm mmm mmmmm said the computer what mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands oh zarquon he muttered to himself then he stared up the corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from which more and purposeful noises were coming and in which the gagged terminals were situated computer he hissed again mmmmm when ungag you mmmmm remind me to punch myself in the mouth mmmmm mmm either one now just tell me this one for yes two for no is it dangerous mmmmm it is mmmm you did nt just go mmmm twice mmmm mmmm hmmmm he inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way down it which was true he was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him and he stopped dead he had nt been able to turn off the doors courtesy voice circuits this doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round and he had been hoping to enter unobserved he leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words which his other head was quite shocked to hear he peered at the dim pink outline of the door and discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the sensor field which extended out into the corridor and told the door when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom it must make cheery and pleasant remark he pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself towards the door flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very very dim perimeter of the field he held his breath and congratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ships gym he then realized he was going to have to speak at this point he took series of very shallow breaths and then said as quickly and as quietly as he could door if you can hear me say so very very quietly very very quietly the door murmured can hear you good now in moment going to ask you to open when you open do not want you to say that you enjoyed it ok ok and do nt want you to say to me that have made simple door very happy or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of job well done ok ok and do not want you to ask me to have nice day understand understand ok said zaphod tensing himself open now the door slid open quietly zaphod slipped quietly through the door closed quietly behind him is that the way you like it mr beeblebrox said the door out loud want you to imagine said zaphod to the group of white robots who swung round to stare at him at that point that have an extremely powerful killozap blaster pistol in my hand there was an immensely cold and savage silence the robots regarded him with hideously dead eyes they stood very still there was something intensely macabre about their appearance especially to zaphod who had never seen one before or even known anything about them the krikkit wars belonged to the ancient past of the galaxy and zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then resulted in it being scrapped and sent to home for degenerate cybermats whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine with the result that zaphod never got near her and that he missed out on period of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at this moment he stared at them in shock it was impossible to explain why but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean clinical evil from their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet they were clearly the calculated product of mind that wanted simply to kill zaphod gulped in cold fear they had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall and had forced passage through some of the vital innards of the ship through the tangled wreckage zaphod could see with further and worse sense of shock that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship the heart of the improbability drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air the heart of gold itself the robot closest to him was regarding him in such way as to suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body mind and capability and when it spoke what it said seemed to bear this impression out before going on to what it actually said it is worth recording at this point that zaphod was the first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten billion years if he had paid more attention to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic being he might have been more impressed by this honour the robot voice was like its body cold sleek and lifeless it had almost cultured rasp to it it sounded as ancient as it was it said you do have killozap blaster pistol in your hand zaphod did nt know what it meant for moment but then he glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was yeah he said in kind of relieved sneer which is quite tricky well would nt want to overtax your imagination robot for while nobody said anything and zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation and that it was up to him ca nt help noticing that you have parked your ship he said with nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction through mine there was no denying this without regard for any kind of proper dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship precisely where they wanted it to be which meant that it was simply locked through the heart of gold as if they were nothing more than two combs again they made no response to this and zaphod wondered if the conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions have nt you he added yes replied the robot er ok said zaphod so what are you cats doing here silence robots said zaphod what are you robots doing here we have come rasped the robot for the gold of the bail zaphod nodded he waggled his gun to invite further elaboration the robot seemed to understand this the gold bail is part of the key we seek continued the robot to release our masters from krikkit zaphod nodded again he waggled his gun again the key continued the robot simply was disintegrated in time and space the golden bail is embedded in the device which drives your ship it will be reconstituted in the key our masters shall be released the universal readjustment will continue zaphod nodded again what are you talking about he said slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot totally expressionless face he seemed to be finding the conversation depressing obliteration it said we seek the key it repeated we already have the wooden pillar the steel pillar and the perspex pillar in moment we will have the gold bail no you wo nt we will stated the robot no you wo nt it makes my ship work in moment repeated the robot patiently we will have the gold bail you will not said zaphod and then we must go said the robot in all seriousness to party oh said zaphod startled can come no said the robot we are going to shoot you oh yeah said zaphod waggling his gun yes said the robot and they shot him zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down chapter 12 shhh said slartibartfast listen and watch night had now fallen on ancient krikkit the sky was dark and empty the only light was coming from the nearby town from which pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze they stood beneath tree from which heady fragrances wafted around them arthur squatted and felt the informational illusion of the soil and the grass he ran it through his fingers the soil seemed heavy and rich the grass strong it was hard to avoid the impression that this was thoroughly delightful place in all respects the sky was however extremely blank and seemed to arthur to cast certain chill over the otherwise idyllic if currently invisible landscape still he supposed it question of what you re used to he felt tap on his shoulder and looked up slartibartfast was quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of the hill he looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and waving and moving slowly in their direction as they came nearer sounds became audible too and soon the dim lights and noises resolved themselves into small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town they walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree swinging lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass chattering contentedly and actually singing song about how terribly nice everything was how happy they were how much they enjoyed working on the farm and how pleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children with lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of year and that it was pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so much arthur could almost imagine paul mccartney sitting with his feet up by the fire on evening humming it to linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds and thinking probably essex the masters of krikkit breathed slartibartfast in sepulchral tones coming as it did so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about essex this remark caused arthur moment confusion then the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind and he discovered that he still did nt understand what the old man meant what he said the masters of krikkit said slartibartfast again and if his breathing had been sepulchral before this time he sounded like someone in hades with bronchitis arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point the people in the group were clearly alien if only because they seemed little tall thin angular and almost as pale as to be white but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant little whimsical perhaps one would nt necessarily want to spend long coach journey with them but the point was that if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough so why all this rasping lungwork from slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to radio commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them then this krikkit angle was tough one too he had nt quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket and what slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what was going through his mind the game you know as cricket he said and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time of all the races on the galaxy only the english could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the universe and transform it into what afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game rather fond of it myself he added but in most people eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket that very nasty um said arthur with reflective frown to indicate that his cognitive synapses were coping with this as best as they could um and these said slartibartfast slipping back into crypt guttural and indicating the group of krikkit men who had now walked past them are the ones who started it all and it will start tonight come we will follow and see why they slipped out from underneath the tree and followed the cheery party along the dark hill path their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry though as they were simply walking through recorded informational illusion they could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them arthur noticed that couple of members of the party were now singing different song it came lilting back to them through the soft night air and was sweet romantic ballad which would have netted mccartney kent and sussex and enabled him to put in fair offer for hampshire you must surely know said slartibartfast to ford what it is that is about to happen me said ford no did you not learn ancient galactic history when you were child was in the cybercubicle behind zaphod said ford it was very distracting which is nt to say that did nt learn some pretty stunning things at this point arthur noticed curious feature to the song that the party were singing the middle eight bridge which would have had mccartney firmly consolidated in winchester and gazing intently over the test valley to the rich pickings of the new forest beyond had some curious lyrics the songwriter was referring to meeting with girl not under the moon or beneath the stars but above the grass which struck arthur little prosaic then he looked up again at the bewildering black sky and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here if only he could grasp what it was it gave him feeling of being alone in the universe and he said so no said slartibartfast with slight quickening of his step the people of krikkit have never thought to themselves we are alone in the universe they are surrounded by huge dust cloud you see their single sun with its single world and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the galaxy because of the dust cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky at night it is totally blank during the day there is the sun but you ca nt look directly at that so they do nt they are hardly aware of the sky it as if they had blind spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon you see the reason why they have never thought we are alone in the universe is that until tonight they do nt know about the universe until tonight he moved on leaving the words ringing in the air behind him imagine he said never even thinking we are alone simply because it has never occurred to you to think that there any other way to be he moved on again afraid this is going to be little unnerving he added as he spoke they became aware of very thin roaring scream high up in the sightless sky above them they glanced upwards in alarm but for moment or two could see nothing then arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise but that none of them seemed to know what to so with it they were glancing around themselves in consternation left right forwards backwards even at the ground it never occurred to them to look upwards the profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated few moments later when the burning wreckage of spaceship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half mile from where they were standing was something that you had to be there to experience some speak of the heart of gold in hushed tones some of the starship bistromath many speak of the legendary and gigantic starship titanic majestic and luxurious cruiseliner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of artifactovol some hundreds of years ago now and with good reason it was sensationally beautiful staggeringly huge and more pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history see note below on the campaign for real time but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of improbability physics long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was fully or at all understood the designers and engineers decided in their innocence to build prototype improbability field into it which was meant supposedly to ensure that it was infinitely improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship they did not realize that because of the quasireciprocal and circular nature of all improbability calculations anything that was infinitely improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately the starship titanic was monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like silver arcturan megavoidwhale amongst the laser lit tracery of its construction gantries brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness but when launched it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message an sos before undergoing sudden and gratuitous total existence failure however the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another it was conclusively proven that more people watched the trid coverage of the launch than actually existed at the time and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of audience research another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the star ysllodins underwent few hours later ysllodins is the star around which most of the galaxy major insurance underwriters live or rather lived but whilst these spaceships and other great ones which come to mind such as the galactic fleet battleships the gss daring the gss audacy and the gss suicidal insanity are all spoken of with awe pride enthusiasm affection admiration regret jealousy resentment in fact most of the better known emotions the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was krikkit one the first spaceship ever built by the people of krikkit this is not because it was wonderful ship it was nt it was crazy piece of near junk it looked as if it had been knocked up in somebody backyard and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked up the astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was one well it was nt but that it was done at all the period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of krikkit had discovered that there was such thing as space and the launching of their first spaceship was almost exactly year ford prefect was extremely grateful as he strapped himself in that this was just another informational illusion and that he was therefore completely safe in real life it was nt ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in china extremely rickety was one phrase which sprang to mind and please may get out was another this is going to fly said arthur giving gaunt looks at the lashedtogether pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship slartibartfast assured him that it would that they were perfectly safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not little harrowing ford and arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed why not said ford go mad in front of them and of course totally unaware of their presence for the very good reason that they were nt actually there were the three pilots they had also constructed the ship they had been on the hill path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs their brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien spaceship they had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burntup spaceship all the while singing lilting spaceship stripping ditties they had then built their own ship and this was it this was their ship and they were currently singing little song about that too expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership the chorus was little poignant and told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage away from the company of their wives and children who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up pow they took off they roared into the sky like ship that knew precisely what it was doing no way said ford while later after they had recovered from the shock of acceleration and were climbing up out of the planet atmosphere no way he repeated does anyone design and build ship like this in year no matter how motivated do nt believe it prove it to me and still wo nt believe it he shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of tiny port at the nothingness outside it the trip passed uneventfully for while and slartibartfast fastwound them through it very quickly therefore they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow spherical dust cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet occupying as it were the next orbit out it was more as if there was gradual change in the texture and consistency of space the darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them it was very cold darkness very blank and heavy darkness it was the darkness of the night sky of krikkit the coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took slow grip on arthur heart and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the krikkit pilots which hung in the air like thick static charge they were now on the very boundary of the historical knowledge of their race this was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated or even known that there was any speculation to be done the darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship inside was the silence of history their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky from which the wrecked spaceship could have come another world maybe strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of krikkit history was gathering itself to deliver another blow still the darkness thrummed at them the blank enclosing darkness it seemed closer and closer thicker and thicker heavier and heavier and suddenly it was gone they flew out of the cloud they saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear for while they flew on motionless against the starry sweep of the galaxy itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the universe and then they turned round it ll have to go the men of krikkit said as they headed back for home on the way back they sang number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace justice morality culture sport family life and the obliteration of all other life forms chapter 13 so you see said slartibartfast slowly stirring his artificially constructed coffee and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers between the interactive perceptions of mind and universe and thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space how it is yes said arthur yes said ford what do do said arthur with this piece of chicken slartibartfast glanced at him gravely toy with it he said toy with it he demonstrated with his own piece arthur did so and felt the slight tingle of mathematical function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four dimensionally through what slartibartfast had assured him was fivedimensional space overnight said slartibartfast the whole population of krikkit was transformed from being charming delightful intelligent if whimsical interpolated arthur ordinary people said slartibartfast into charming delightful intelligent whimsical manic xenophobes the idea of universe did nt fit into their world picture so to speak they simply could nt cope with it and so charmingly delightfully intelligently whimsically if you like they decided to destroy it what the matter now do nt like the wine very much said arthur sniffing it well send it back it all part of the mathematics of it arthur did so he did nt like the topography of the waiters smile but he never liked graphs anyway where are we going said ford back to the room of informational illusions said slartibartfast rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of paper napkin for the second half chapter 14 the people of krikkit said his high judgmental supremacy judiciary pag livr the learned impartial and very relaxed chairman of the board of judges at the krikkit war crimes trial are well you know they re just bunch of real sweet guys you know who just happen to want to kill everybody hell feel the same way some mornings shit ok he continued swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of him and pausing moment to pick thread off his ceremonial beach loafers so you would nt necessarily want to share galaxy with these guys this was true the krikkit attack on the galaxy had been stunning thousands and thousands of huge krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence the galaxy which had been enjoying period of unusual peace and prosperity at the time reeled like man getting mugged in meadow mean continued judiciary pag gazing round the ultramodern this was ten billion years ago when ultramodern meant lots of stainless steel and brushed concrete and huge courtroom these guys are just obsessed this too was true and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose the destruction of everything that was nt krikkit it is also the only explanation for their bewildering sudden grasp of all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of spaceships and their millions of lethal white robots these had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them in most cases however the terror was extremely shortlived as was the person experiencing the terror they were savage singleminded flying battle machines they wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which brandished one way would knock down buildings and brandished another way fired blistering omnidestructo zap rays and brandished third way launched hideous arsenal of grenades ranging from minor incendiary devices to maxislorta hypernuclear devices which could take out major sun simply striking the grenades with the battleclubs simultaneously primed them and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles ok said judiciary pag again so we won he paused and chewed little gum we won he repeated but that no big deal mean mediumsized galaxy against one little world and how long did it take us clerk of the court mlud said the severe little man in black rising how long kiddo it is trifle difficult mlud to be precise in this matter time and distance relax guy be vague hardly like to be vague mlud over such bite the bullet and be it the clerk of the court blinked at him it was clear that like most of the galactic legal profession he found judiciary pag or zipo bibrok 108 as his private name was known inexplicably to be rather distressing figure he was clearly bounder and cad he seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked and unfortunately he appeared to be right er well mlud very approximately two thousand years the clerk murmured unhappily and how many guys zilched out two grillion mlud the clerk sat down hydrospectic photo of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly judiciary pag gazed once more around the courtroom wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire galactic administration all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies depending on metabolism and custom behind wall of zapproof crystal stood representative group of the people of krikkit looking with calm polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment on them this was the most momentous occasion in legal history and judiciary pag knew it he took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair that whole lotta stiffs he said quietly the grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view so like said these are bunch of really sweet guys but you would nt want to share galaxy with them not if they re just gon na keep at it not if they re not gon na learn to relax little mean it just gon na be continual nervous time isnt it right pow pow pow when are they next coming at us peaceful coexistence is just right out right get me some water somebody thank you he sat back and sipped reflectively ok he said hear me hear me it like these guys you know are entitled to their own view of the universe and according to their view which the universe forced on them right they did right sounds crazy but think you ll agree they believe in he consulted piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his judicial jeans they believe in peace justice morality culture sport family life and the obliteration of all other life forms he shrugged ve heard lot worse he said he scratched his crotch reflectively freeeow he said he took another sip of water then held it up to the light and frowned at it he twisted it round hey is there something in this water he said er no mlud said the court usher who had brought it to him rather nervously then take it away snapped judiciary pag and put something in it got an idea he pushed away the glass and leaned forward hear me hear me he said the solution was brilliant and went like this the planet of krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an envelope of slotime inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly all light would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible unless it were locked from the outside when the rest of the universe came to its final end when the whole of creation reached its dying fall this was all of course in the days before it was known that the end of the universe would be spectacular catering venture and life and matter ceased to exist then the planet of krikkit and its sun would emerge from its slotime envelope and continue solitary existence such as it craved in the twilight of the universal void the lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the envelope the key would be the symbol of the galaxy the wikkit gate by the time the applause in the court had died down judiciary pag was already in the sensoshower with rather nice member of the jury that he slipped note to half an hour earlier chapter 15 two months later zipo bibrok 108 had cut the bottoms off his galactic state jeans and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded lying on jewelled beach having essence of qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of the jury she was soolfinian girl from beyond the cloudworlds of yaga she had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal bodies did you hear the news she said weeeeelaaaaah said zipo bibrok 108 and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this none of this was on the tape of informational illusions and is all based on hearsay no he added when the thing that had made him say weeeeelaaaaah had stopped happening he moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval vod three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously beautiful horizon and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest tanning power ever known fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea trailed along the beach and drifted back to sea again wondering where to go next on mad impulse it went up to the beach again it drifted back to sea hope it is nt good news muttered zipo bibrok 108 cos do nt think could bear it your krikkit judgment was carried out today said the girl sumptuously there was no need to say such straightforward thing sumptuously but she went ahead and did it anyway because it was that sort of day heard it on the radio she said when went back to the ship for the oil uhuh muttered zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled sand something happened she said mmmm just after the slotime envelope was locked she said and paused moment from rubbing in the essence of qualactin krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all it appeared and tried to seize the key zipo sat up sharply hey what he said it all right she said in voice which would have calmed the big bang down apparently there was short battle the key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the spacetime continuum apparently they are lost for ever she smiled and ran little more essence of qualactin on to her fingertips he relaxed and lay back down do what you did moment or two ago he murmured that she said no no he said that she tried again that she asked weeeeelaaaaah again you had to be there the fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again magician wandered along the beach but no one needed him chapter 16 nothing is lost for ever said slartibartfast his face flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away except for the cathedral of chalesm the what said arthur with start the cathedral of chalesm repeated slartibartfast it was during the course of my researches at the campaign for real time that the what said arthur again the old man paused and gathered his thoughts for what he hoped would be one last onslaught on his story the robot waiter moved through the spacetime matrices in way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious made snatch for the candle and got it they had had the bill had argued convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they had had and as arthur had been dimly aware had thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into parking orbit round strange planet the waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro all will become clear said slartibartfast when in minute listen the time streams are now very polluted there lot of muck floating about in them flotsam and jetsam and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world eddies in the spacetime continuum you see so hear said arthur look where are we going said ford pushing his chair back from the table with impatience because eager to get there we are going said slartibartfast in slow measured voice to try to prevent the war robots of krikkit from regaining the whole of the key they need to unlock the planet of krikkit from the slotime envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad masters it just said ford that you mentioned party did said slartibartfast and hung his head he realized that it had been mistake because the idea seemed to exercise strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of ford prefect the more that slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of krikkit and its people the more ford prefect wanted to drink lot and dance with girls the old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he absolutely had to but there it was the fact was out and ford prefect had attached himself to it the way an arcturan megaleach attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship when said ford eagerly do we get there when ve finished telling you why we have to go there know why going said ford and leaned back sticking his hands behind his head he gave one of his smiles which made people twitch slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement he had been planning to learn to play the octraventral heebiephone pleasantly futile task he knew because he had the wrong number of mouths he had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important instead he had somehow got talked into doing some parttime work for the campaign for real time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life as result he now found himself spending his fastdeclining years combating evil and trying to save the galaxy he found it exhausting work and sighed heavily listen he said at camtim what said arthur the campaign for real time which will tell you about later noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces of the missing key only two could trace exactly the wooden pillar which appeared on your planet and the silver bail it seems to be at some sort of party we must go there to retrieve it before the krikkit robots find it or who knows what may hap no said ford firmly we must go to the party in order to drink lot and dance with girls but have nt you understood everything yes said ford with sudden and unexpected fierceness ive understood it all perfectly well that why want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still any left if everything you ve shown us is true true of course it true then we do nt stand whelk chance in supernova what said arthur sharply again he had been following the conversation doggedly up to this point and was keen not to lose the thread now whelk chance in supernova repeated ford without losing momentum the what whelk got to do with supernova said arthur it does nt said ford levelly stand chance in one he paused to see if the matter was now cleared up the freshly puzzled looks clambering across arthur face told him that it was nt supernova said ford as quickly and as clearly as he could is star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of billion suns and then collapses as superheavy neutron star it star which burns up other stars got it nothing stands chance in supernova see said arthur the so why whelk particularly why not whelk does nt matter arthur accepted this and ford continued picking up his early fierce momentum as best he could the point is he said that people like you and me slartibartfast and arthur particularly and especially arthur are just dilletantes eccentrics layabouts fartarounds if you like slartibartfast frowned partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage he started to speak is as far as he got we re not obsessed by anything you see insisted ford and that the deciding factor we ca nt win against obsession they care we do nt they win care about lots of things said slartibartfast his voice trembling partly with annoyance but partly also with uncertainty such as well said the old man life the universe everything really fjords would you die for them fjords blinked slartibartfast in surprise no well then would nt see the point to be honest and still ca nt see the connection said arthur with whelks ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control and refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point the point is he hissed that we are not obsessive people and we do nt stand chance against except for your sudden obsession with whelks pursued arthur which still have nt understood will you please leave whelks out of it will if you will said arthur you brought the subject up it was an error said ford forget them the point is this he leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers what was talking about he said wearily let just go down to the party said slartibartfast for whatever reason he stood up shaking his head think that what was trying to say said ford for some unexplained reason the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom chapter 17 time travel is increasingly regarded as menace history is being polluted the encyclopedia galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of time travel most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who has nt spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented there is certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place one rationalization of this problem states that time travel was by its very nature discovered simultaneously at all periods of history but this is clearly bunk the trouble is that lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well here is an example it may not seem to be an important one to some people but to others it is crucial it is certainly significant in that it was the single event which caused the campaign for real time to be set up in the first place or is it last it depends which way round you see history as happening and this too is now an increasingly vexed question there is or was poet his name was lallafa and he wrote what are widely regarded throughout the galaxy as being the finest poems in existence the songs of the long land they arewere unspeakably wonderful that is to say you couldnt speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion truth and sense of wholeness and oneness of things that you would nt pretty soon need brisk walk round the block possibly pausing at bar on the way back for quick glass of perspective and soda they were that good lallafa had lived in the forests of the long lands of effa he lived there and he wrote his poems there he wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves without the benefit of education or correcting fluid he wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought about that he wrote about the darkness in the forest and what he thought about that he wrote about the girl who had left him and precisely what he thought about that long after his death his poems were found and wondered over news of them spread like morning sunlight for centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier then shortly after the invention of time travel some major correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some highquality correcting fluid and whether he might be persuaded to say few words on that effect they travelled the time waves they found him they explained the situation with some difficulty to him and did indeed persuade him in fact they persuaded him to such an effect that he became extremely rich at their hands and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write which such precision never got around to leaving him and in fact they moved out of the forest to rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat shows on which he sparkled wittily he never got around to writing the poems of course which was problem but an easily solved one the manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed him off for week somewhere with copy of later edition of his book and stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on the way many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were so what changed the first people say that that is nt the point they are nt quite sure what the point is but they are quite sure that that is nt it they set up the campaign for real time to try to stop this sort of thing going on their case was considerably strengthened by the fact that week after they had set themselves up news broke that not only had the great cathedral of chalesm been pulled down in order to build new ion refinery but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion production to start on time that the cathedral of chalesm had now never been built in the first place picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable so lot of history is now gone for ever the campaign for real timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another and between one world and another so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another the past they say is now truly like foreign country they do things exactly the same there chapter 18 arthur materialized and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to he looked around for the others they were nt there he looked around for the others again they still were nt there he closed his eyes he opened them he looked around for the others they obstinately persisted in their absence he closed his eyes again preparatory to making this completely futile exercise once more and because it was only then whilst his eyes were closed that his brain began to register what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were open puzzled frown crept across his face so he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed put if anything it intensified and got good firm grip if this was party it was very bad one so bad in fact that everybody else had left he abandoned this line of thought as futile obviously this was nt party it was cave or labyrinth or tunnel of something there was insufficient light to tell all was darkness damp shiny darkness the only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing which sounded worried he coughed very slightly and then had to listen to the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding corridors and sightless chambers as of some great labyrinth and eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors as if to say yes this happened to every slightest noise he made and it unnerved him he tried to hum cheery tune but by the time it returned to him it was hollow dirge and he stopped his mind was suddenly full of images from the story that slartibartfast had been telling him he halfexpected suddenly to see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him he caught his breath they did nt he let it go again he did nt know what he did expect someone or something however seemed to be expecting him for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign it said silently you have been diverted the sign flicked off again in way which arthur was not at all certain he liked it flicked off with sort of contemptuous flourish arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just ridiculous trick of his imagination neon sign is either on or off depending on whether it has electricity running through it or not there was no way he told himself that it could possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with contemptuous flourish he hugged himself tightly in his dressing gown and shivered nevertheless the neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up bafflingly with just three dots and comma like this only in green neon it was trying arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for second or two to indicate that there was more to come that the sentence was not complete trying with almost superhuman pedantry he reflected or at least inhuman pedantry the sentence then completed itself with these two words arthur dent he reeled he steadied himself to have another clear look at it it still said arthur dent so he reeled again once again the sign flicked off and left him blinking in the darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina welcome the sign now suddenly said after moment it added do nt think the stonecold fear which had been hovering about arthur all this time waiting for its moment recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him he tried to fight it off he dropped into kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television but it must have been someone with stronger knees he peered huntedly into the darkness er hello he said he cleared his throat and said it again more loudly and without the er at some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if somebody started to beat on bass drum he listened to it for few seconds and realized that it was just his heart beating he listened for few seconds more and realized that it wasnt his heart beating it was somebody down the corridor beating on bass drum beads of sweat formed on his brow tensed themselves and leapt off he put hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch which was nt holding up very well the sign changed itself again it said do not be alarmed after pause it added be very very frightened arthur dent once again it flicked off once again it left him in darkness his eyes seemed to be popping out of his head he was nt certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly or if they simply wanted to leave at this point hello he said again this time trying to put note of rugged and aggressive selfassertion into it is anyone there there was no reply nothing this unnerved arthur dent even more than reply would have done and he began to back away from the scary nothingness and the more he backed away the more scared he became after while he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some imagined terror in front of him only to bump into it coming up from behind just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather quickly there was nothing there just blackness this really unnerved him and he started to back away from that back the way he had come after doing this for short while it suddenly occurred to him that he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been backing away from in the first place this he could nt help thinking must be foolish thing to do he decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been backing and turned around again it turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one because there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind him arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of bet you were nt expecting to see me again said the monster which arthur could nt help thinking was strange remark for it to make seeing as he had never met the creature before he could tell that he had nt met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights it was it was it was arthur blinked at it it stood very still it did look little familiar terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at was sixfoothigh hologram of housefly he wondered why anybody would be showing him sixfoothigh hologram of housefly at this time he wondered whose voice he had heard it was terribly realistic hologram it vanished or perhaps you remember me better said the voice suddenly and it was deep hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of drum with evil on its mind as the rabbit with sudden ping there was rabbit there in the black labyrinth with him huge monstrously hideously soft and lovable rabbit an image again but one on which every single soft and lovable hair seemed like real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes born in darkness rumbled the voice raised in darkness one morning poked my head for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive instrument made of flint made by you arthur dent and wielded by you rather hard as recall you turned my skin into bag for keeping interesting stones in happen to know that because in my next life came back as fly again and you swatted me again only this time you swatted me with the bag you made of my previous skin arthur dent you are not merely cruel and heartless man you are also staggeringly tactless the voice paused whilst arthur gawped see you have lost the bag said the voice probably got bored with it did you arthur shook his head helplessly he wanted to explain that he had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with him wherever he went but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that curiously enough even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard skin and was nt the one he had few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was and was nt one he would have chosen himself and heaven knew what would be in it as it was nt his and he would much rather have his original bag back except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it or rather its component parts ie the rabbit skin from its previous owner viz the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address all he actually managed to say was erp meet the newt you trod on said the voice and there was standing in the corridor with arthur giant green scaly newt arthur turned yelped leapt backwards and found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit he yelped again but could find nowhere to leap to that was me too continued the voice in low menacing rumble as if you did nt know know said arthur with start know the interesting thing about reincarnation rasped the voice is that most people most spirits are not aware that it is happening to them he paused for effect as far as arthur was concerned there was already quite enough effect going on was aware hissed the voice that is became aware slowly gradually he whoever he was paused again and gathered breath could hardly help it could he bellowed when the same thing kept happening over and over and over again every life ever lived got killed by arthur dent any world any body any time just getting settled down along comes arthur dent pow he kills me hard not to notice bit of memory jogger bit of pointer bit of bloody giveaway that funny my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the netherworld after another fruitless dentended venture into the land of the living that man who just ran over me as was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked little familiar and gradually got to piece it together dent you multiplememurderer the echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors arthur stood silent and cold his head shaking with disbelief here the moment dent shrieked the voice now reaching feverish pitch of hatred here the moment when at last knew it was indescribably hideous the thing that suddenly opened up in front of arthur making him gasp and gargle with horror but here an attempt at description of how hideous it was it was huge palpitating wet cave with vast slimy rough whalelike creature rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones high above the cave rose vast promontory in which could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves which arthur dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own mouth when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it he staggered back with cry and averted his eyes when he looked again the appalling apparition had gone the corridor was dark and briefly silent he was alone with his thoughts they were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had chaperone the next noise when it came was the low heavy roll of large section of wall trundling aside revealing for the moment just dark blackness behind it arthur looked into it in much the same way that mouse looks into dark dogkennel and the voice spoke to him again tell me it was coincidence dent it said dare you to tell me it was coincidence it was coincidence said arthur quickly it was not came the answering bellow it was said arthur it was if it was coincidence then my name roared the voice is not agrajag and presumably said arthur you would claim that that was your name yes hissed agrajag as if he had just completed rather deft syllogism well afraid it was still coincidence said arthur come in here and say that howled the voice in sudden apoplexy again arthur walked in and said that it was coincidence or at least he nearly said that it was coincidence his tongue rather lost its footing towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and revealed what it was he had walked into it was cathedral of hate it was the product of mind that was not merely twisted but actually sprained it was huge it was horrific it had statue in it we will come to the statue in moment the vast incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of mountain and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of it seemed to arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it it was black where it was nt black you were inclined to wish that it was because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eyedefying colours from ultra violent to infra dead taking in liver purple loathsome lilac matter yellow burnt hombre and gan green on the way the unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which would have put francis bacon off his lunch the gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls from the pillars from the flying buttresses from the choir stalls towards the statue to which we will come in moment and if the gargoyles would have put francis bacon off his lunch then it was clear from the gargoyles faces that the statue would have put them off theirs had they been alive to eat it which they were nt and had anybody tried to serve them some which they would nt around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to arthur dent the names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had asterisks against them so for instance the name of cow which had been slaughtered and of which arthur dent had happened to eat fillet steak would have the plainest engraving whereas the name of fish which arthur had himself caught and then decided he did nt like and left on the side of the plate had double underlining three sets of asterisks and bleeding dagger added as decoration just to make the point and what was most disturbing about all this apart from the statue to which we are by degrees coming was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person over and over again and it was equally clear that this person was however unfairly extremely upset and annoyed in fact it would be fair to say that he had reached level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the universe it was an annoyance of epic proportions burning searing flame of annoyance an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage and this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the statue in the centre of all this monstrosity which was statue of arthur dent and an unflattering one fifty feet tall if it was an inch there was not an inch of it which was nt crammed with insult to its subject matter and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad from the small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown there was no aspect of arthur dent which wasnt lambasted and vilified by the sculptor arthur appeared as gorgon an evil rapacious ravenning bloodied ogre slaughtering his way through an innocent oneman universe with each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in fit of artistic fervour had decided to give him he was either braining rabbit swatting fly pulling wishbone picking flea out of his hair or doing something which arthur at first looking could nt quite identify his many feet were mostly stamping on ants arthur put his hands over his eyes hung his head and shook it slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things and when he opened his eyes again there in front of him stood the figure of the man or creature or whatever it was that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time hhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaahhhhhh said agrajag he or it or whatever looked like mad fat bat he waddled slowly around arthur and poked at him with bent claws look protested arthur hhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaahhhhhh explained agrajag and arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition agrajag was black bloated wrinkled and leathery his batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong muscular beaters of the air the frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds he had the most astounding collection of teeth they looked as if they each came from completely different animal and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he lacerate half his own face along with it and possibly put an eye out as well each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as fish in privet bush was at cricket match he rasped this seemed on the face of it such preposterous notion that arthur practically choked not in this body screeched the creature not in this body this is my last body my last life this is my revenge body my killarthurdent body my last chance had to fight to get it too but was at roared agrajag cricket match had weak heart condition but what said to my wife can happen to me at cricket match as watching what happens two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of me the last thing ca nt help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is arthur dent wearing rabbit bone in his beard coincidence yes said arthur coincidence screamed the creature painfully thrashing its broken wings and opening short gash on its right cheek with particularly nasty tooth on closer examination such as hed been hoping to avoid arthur noticed that much of agrajag face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters he backed away nervously he tugged at his beard he was appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it he pulled it out and threw it away look he said it just fate playing silly buggers with you with me with us it complete coincidence what have you got against me dent snarled the creature advancing on him in painful waddle nothing insisted arthur honestly nothing agrajag fixed him with beady stare seems strange way to relate to somebody you ve got nothing against killing them all the time very curious piece of social interaction would call that also call it lie but look said arthur very sorry there been terrible misunderstanding ve got to go have you got clock meant to be helping save the universe he backed away still further agrajag advanced still further at one point he hissed at one point decided to give up yes would not come back would stay in the netherworld and what happened arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and did nt want to have one either he found he had backed up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what herculean effort into monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers he glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering above him he was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world pursued agrajag as bunch of petunias in might add bowl this particularly happy little lifetime started off with me in my bowl unsupported three hundred miles above the surface of particularly grim planet not naturally tenable position for bowl of petunias you might think and you be right that life ended very short while later three hundred miles lower in might add the fresh wreckage of whale my spirit brother he leered at arthur with renewed hatred on the way down he snarled could nt help noticing flashylooking white spaceship and looking out of port on this flashylooking spaceship was smuglooking arthur dent coincidence yes yelped arthur he glanced up again and realized that the arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence bowl of doomed petunias this was not concept which leapt easily to the eye must go insisted arthur you may go said agrajag after have killed you no that wo nt be any use explained arthur beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper because have to save the universe you see have to find silver bail that the point tricky thing to do dead save the universe spat agrajag with contempt you should have thought of that before you started your vendetta against me what about the time you were on stavromula beta and someone ve never been there said arthur tried to assassinate you and you ducked who do you think the bullet hit what did you say never been there repeated arthur what are you talking about have to go agrajag stopped in his tracks you must have been there you were responsible for my death there as everywhere else an innocent bystander he quivered ve never heard of the place insisted arthur ve certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me other than you perhaps go there later do you think agrajag blinked slowly in kind of frozen logical horror you have nt been to stavromula beta yet he whispered no said arthur do nt know anything about the place certainly never been to it and do nt have any plans to go oh you go there all right muttered agrajag in broken voice you go there all right oh zark he tottered and stared wildly about him at his huge cathedral of hate ve brought you here too soon he started to scream and bellow ve brought you here too zarking soon suddenly he rallied and turned baleful hating eye on arthur going to kill you anyway he roared even if it logical impossibility going to zarking well try going to blow this whole mountain up he screamed let see you get out of this one dent he rushed in painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be small black sacrificial altar he was shouting so wildly now that he was really carving his face up badly arthur leaped down from his vantage place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try to restrain the threequarterscrazed creature he leaped upon him and brought the strange monstrosity crashing down on top of the altar agrajag screamed again thrashed wildly for brief moment and turned wild eye on arthur you know what you ve done he gurgled painfully you ve only gone and killed me again mean what do you want from me blood he thrashed again in brief apoplectic fit quivered and collapsed smacking large red button on the altar as he did so arthur started with horror and fear first at what he appeared to have done and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency he stared wildly around him the only exit appeared to be the way he came in he pelted towards it throwing away the nasty fake leopardskin bag as he did so he dashed randomly haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons sirens flashing lights suddenly he turned corner and there was light in front of him it was nt flashing it was daylight chapter 19 although it has been said that on earth alone in our galaxy is krikkit or cricket treated as fit subject for game and that for this reason the earth has been shunned this does only apply to our galaxy and more specifically to our dimension in some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves and have been playing peculiar game called brockian ultracricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is let be blunt it nasty game says the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will know that they re pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be smashed and done in and would be too if anyone could work out way of firing missiles at rightangles to reality this is another example of the fact that the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped off especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon when very few of the regular staff are there there is fundamental point here the history of the hitch hiker guide to the galaxy is one of idealism struggle despair passion success failure and enormously long lunchbreaks the earliest origins of the guide are now along with most of its financial records lost in the mists of time for other and more curious theories about where they are lost see below most of the surviving stories however speak of founding editor called hurling frootmig hurling frootmig it is said founded the guide established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and went bust there followed many years of penury and heartsearching during which he consulted friends sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind thought about this and that fooled about with weights and then after chance encounter with the holy lunching friars of voondon who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of man temporal day and man temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life so lunch should be seen as the centre of man spiritual life and be held in jolly nice restaurants he refounded the guide laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both and led the guide on to its first major commercial success he also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunchbreak which was subsequently to play such crucial part in the guide history since it meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing shortly after this the guide was taken over by megadodo publications of ursa minor beta thus putting the whole thing on very sound financial footing and allowing the fourth editor lig lury jr to embark on lunchbreaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors who have started undertaking sponsored lunchbreaks for charity seem like mere sandwiches in comparison in fact lig never formally resigned his editorship he merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned though well over century has now passed many members of the guide staff still retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for ham croissant and will yet return to put in solid afternoon work strictly speaking all editors since lig lury jr have therefore been designated acting editors and lig desk is still preserved the way he left it with the addition of small sign which says lig lury jr editor missing presumed fed some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that lig actually perished in the guide first extraordinary experiments in alternative bookkeeping very little is known of this and less still said anyone who even notices let alone calls attention to the curious but utter coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster is liable to get sued to smithereens it is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet earth to make way for new hyperspace bypass saw dramatic upsurge in the number of ufo sightings there not only above lords cricket ground in st john wood london but also above glastonbury in somerset glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings witchcraft leylines an wart curing and had now been selected as the site for the new hitch hiker guide financial records office and indeed ten years worth of financial records were transferred to magic hill just outside the city mere hours before the vogons arrived none of these facts however strange or inexplicable is as strange or inexplicable as the rules of the game of brockian ultracricket as played in the higher dimensions full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were all bound together in single volume they underwent gravitational collapse and became black hole brief summary however is as follows rule one grow at least three extra legs you wo nt need them but it keeps the crowds amused rule two find one good brockian ultracricket player clone him off few times this saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training rule three put your team and the opposing team in large field and build high wall round them the reason for this is that though the game is major spectator sport the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what going on leads them to imagine that it lot more exciting than it really is crowd that has just watched rather humdrum game experiences far less life affirmation than crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history rule four throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall for the players anything will do cricket bats basecube bats tennis guns skis anything you can get good swing with rule five the players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand whenever player scores hit on another player he should immediately run away and apologize from safe distance apologies should be concise sincere and for maximum clarity and points delivered through megaphone rule six the winning team shall be the first team that wins curiously enough the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher dimensions the less it is actually played since most of the competing teams are now in state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of these rules this is all for the best because in the long run good solid war is less psychologically damaging than protracted game of brockian ultracricket chapter 20 as arthur ran darting dashing and panting down the side of the mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very very slightly beneath him there was rumble roar and slight blurred movement and lick of heat in the distance behind and above him he ran in frenzy of fear the land began to slide and he suddenly felt the force of the word landslide in way which had never been apparent to him before it had always just been word to him but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is strange and sickening thing for land to do it was doing it with him on it he felt ill with fear and shaking the ground slid the mountain slurred he slipped he fell he stood he slipped again and ran the avalance began stones then rocks then boulders which pranced past him like clumsy puppies only much much bigger much much harder and heavier and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you his eyes danced with them his feet danced with the dancing ground he ran as if running was terrible sweating sickness his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him the logic of the situation ie that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of agrajag was to happen was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time he ran with the fear of death in him under him over him and grabbing hold of his hair and suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable momentum but just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him small navyblue holdall that he knew for fact he had lost in the baggageretrieval system at athens airport some ten years in his personal timescale previously and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing what he was doing was this he was flying he glanced around him in surprise but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing no part of him was touching the ground and no part of him was even approaching it he was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him he could now do something about that blinking with the non effort of it he wafted higher into the air and now the boulders were hurtling through the air beneath him he looked downwards with intense curiosity between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air empty that is if you discounted the boulders which did nt stay in it for long but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity the same law which seemed all of sudden to have given arthur sabbatical it occurred to him almost instantly with the instinctive correctness that selfpreservation instils in the mind that he must nt try to think about it that if he did the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there and all would suddenly be lost so he thought about tulips it was difficult but he did he thought about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips he thought about the interesting variety of colours they came in and wondered what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew or had grown on the earth would be found within radius of one mile from windmill after while he got dangerously bored with this train of thought felt the air slipping away beneath him felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to think about so he thought about athens airport for bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about two hundred yards above the ground he wondered for moment how he was going to get back down to it but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again and tried to look at the situation steadily he was flying what was he going to do about it he looked back down at the ground he did nt look at it hard but did his best just to give it an idle glance as it were in passing there were couple of things he could nt help noticing one was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself there was crater just little way beneath the peak presumably where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral the statue of himself and the sadly abused figure of agrajag the other was his holdall the one he had lost at athens airport it was sitting pertly on piece of clear ground surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them why this should be he could not speculate but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bag being there in the first place it was not speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway the thing is it was there and the nasty fake leopardskin bag seemed to have disappeared which was all to the good if not entirely to the explicable he was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up here he was flying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien planet the name of which he could nt even remember he could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece of what used to be his life here so many lightyears from the pulverized remains of his home furthermore he realized the bag if it was still in the state in which he lost it would contain can which would have in it the only greek olive oil still surviving in the universe slowly carefully inch by inch he began to bob downwards swinging gently from side to side like nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground it went well he was feeling good the air supported him but let him through two minutes later he was hovering mere two feet above the bag and was faced with some difficult decision he bobbed there lightly he frowned but again as lightly as he could if he picked the bag up could he carry it might nt the extra weight just pull him straight to the ground might nt the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air might nt he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of the air back on to the ground for moment or two if he did would he ever be able to fly again the sensation when he allowed himself to be aware of it was so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it perhaps for ever with this worry in mind he bobbed upwards little again just to try the feel of it the surprising and effortless movement of it he bobbed he floated he tried little swoop the swoop was terrific with his arms spread out in front of him his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him he dived down out of the sky bellied along body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again catching himself at the top of the swing and holding just holding he stayed there it was wonderful and that he realized was the way of picking up the bag he would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing he would carry it on up with him he might wobble bit but he was certain that he could hold it he tried one or two more practice swoops and they got better and better the air on his face the bounce and woof of his body all combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he had nt felt since since well as far as he could work out since he was born he drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside which was he discovered pretty nasty it had wasted ravaged look he decided not to look at it any more he would just pick up the bag and then he did nt know what he was going to do after he had picked up the bag he decided he would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there he judged himself against the wind pushed up against it and turned around he floated on its body he did nt realize but his body was willoming at this point he ducked down under the airstream dipped and dived the air threw itself past him he thrilled through it the ground wobbled uncertainly straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up to meet him offering the bag its cracked plastic handles up towards him halfway down there was sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer believe he was doing this and therefore he very nearly was nt but he recovered himself in time skimmed over the ground slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag and began to climb back up could nt make it and all of sudden collapsed bruised scratched and shaking in the stony ground he staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment his feet suddenly were stuck heavily to the ground in the way they always had been his body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground his mind had all the lightness of bag of lead he sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness he tried hopelessly to run but his legs were suddenly too weak he tripped and flopped forward at that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only can of greek olive oil but dutyfree allowance of retsina and in the pleasurable shock of that realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now flying again he whooped and cried with relief and pleasure and sheer physical delight he swooped he wheeled he skidded and whirled through the air cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents of the holdall he felt the way he imagined an angel must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of pin whilst being counted by philosophers he laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as pair of cracked sunglasses some sandfilled swimming trunks some creased postcards of santorini large and unsightly towel some interesting stones and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved to think he would never meet again even if the reason why was sad one he dropped the stones put on the sunglasses and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind ten minutes later drifting idly through cloud he got large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back chapter 21 the longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation and still no one shows any signs of leaving somebody did once look at his watch but that was eleven years ago and there has been no followup the mess is extraordinary and has to be seen to be believed but if you do nt have any particular need to believe it then dont go and look because you wo nt enjoy it there have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds and there is one theory that this is battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpetcleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures but you shouldnt believe anything you hear at parties and particularly not anything you hear at this one one of the problems and it one which is obviously going to get worse is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the greatgrandchildren of the people who would nt leave in the first place and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers or gibbering idiots or more and more frequently both either way it means that genetically speaking each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one so other factors come into operation like when the drink is going to run out now because of certain things which have happened which seemed like good idea at the time and one of the problems with party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas that point seems still to be long way off one of the things which seemed like good idea at the time was that the party should fly not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly but literally one night long ago band of drunken astroengineers of the first generation clambered round the building digging this fixing that banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose the following morning it was startled to find itself shining on building full of happy drunken people which was now floating like young and uncertain bird over the treetops not only that but the flying party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily if they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants they wanted to make sure they had might on their side the transition from fulltime cocktail party to parttime raiding party came with ease and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years they looted they raided they held whole cities for ransom for fresh supplies of cheese crackers avocado dip spare ribs and wine and spirits which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers the problem of when the drink is going to run out is however going to have to be faced one day the planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it was when they first started floating over it it is in bad shape the party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it and no one has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky it is one hell of party it is also one hell of thing to get hit by in the small of the back chapter 22 arthur lay floundering in pain on piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced concrete flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him there was sound he could nt immediately identify partly because he did nt know the tune left my leg in jaglan beta and partly because the band playing it were very tired and some members of it were playing it in threefour time some in four four and some in kind of pieeyed r2 each according to the amount of sleep he managed to grab recently he lay panting heavily in the wet air and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt wherever he touched himself he encountered pain after short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting he seemed to have sprained his wrist his back too was hurting but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt but just bruised and little shaken as who would nt be he couldnt understand what building would be doing flying through the clouds on the other hand he would have been little hardpressed to come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence so he decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept each other he looked up from where he was lying wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him the building proper he seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around it was hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its foundations and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end nervously he stood up and suddenly looking out over the edge he felt nauseous with vertigo he pressed himself back against the wall wet with mist and sweat his head was swimming freestyle but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly even though he had got up here under his own power he could now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him he was not about to try his luck jumping he was not about to move an inch closer to the edge clutching his holdall he edged along the wall hoping to find doorway in the solid weight of the can of olive oil was great reassurance to him he was edging in the direction of the nearest corner in the hope that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one which offered none the unsteadiness of the building flight made him feel sick with fear and after short while he took the towel from out of his holdall and did something with it which once again justified its supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitchhike round the galaxy he put it over his head so he would nt have to see what he was doing his feet edged along the ground his outstretched hand edged along the wall finally he came to the corner and as his hand rounded the corner it encountered something which gave him such shock that he nearly fell straight off it was another hand the two hands gripped each other he desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back from his eyes but it was holding the holdall with the olive oil the retsina and the postcards from santorini and he very much did nt want to put it down he experienced one of those self moments one of those moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think who am what am up to what have achieved am doing well he whimpered very slightly he tried to free his hand but he could nt the other hand was holding his tightly he had no recourse but to edge onwards towards the corner he leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to dislodge the towel this seemed to provoke sharp cry of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand the towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into those of ford prefect beyond him stood slartibartfast and beyond them he could clearly see porchway and large closed door they were both pressed back against the wall eyes wild with terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building where the zarking photon have you been hissed ford panic stricken er well stuttered arthur not really knowing how to sum it all up that briefly here and there what are you doing here ford turned his wild eyes on arthur again they wo nt let us in without bottle he hissed the first thing arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party apart from the noise the suffocating heat the wild profusion of colours that protuded dimly through the atmosphere of heavy smoke the carpets thick with ground glass ash and avocado droppings and the small group of pterodactyllike creatures in lurex who descended on his cherished bottle of retsina squawking new pleasure new pleasure was trillian being chatted up by thunder god did nt see you at milliways he was saying were you the one with the hammer yes much prefer it here so much less reputable so much more fraught squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room the outer dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy noisy creatures cheerfully yelling things that nobody could hear at each other and occasionally having crises seems fun said trillian what did you say arthur said how the hell did you get here was row of dots flowing randomly through the universe have you met thor he makes thunder hello said arthur expect that must be very interesting hi said thor it is have you got drink er no actually then why do nt you go and get one see you later arthur said trillian something jogged arthur mind and he looked around huntedly zaphod is nt here is he he said see you said trillian firmly later thor glared at him with hard coalblack eyes his beard bristled what little light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet he took trillian elbow in his extremely large hand and the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like couple of volkswagens parking he led her away one of the interesting things about being immortal he said is one of the interesting things about space arthur heard slartibartfast saying to large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing fight with pink duvet and was gazing raptly at the old man deep eyes and silver beard is how dull it is dull said the creature and blinked her rather wrinkled and bloodshot eyes yes said slartibartfast staggeringly dull bewilderingly so you see there so much of it and so little in it would you like me to quote some statistics er well please would like to they too are quite sensationally dull ll come back and hear them in moment she said patting him on the arm lifted up her skirts like hovercraft and moved off into the heaving crown thought she never go growled the old man come earthman arthur we must find the silver bail it is here somewhere ca nt we just relax little arthur said ve had tough day trillian here incidentally she did nt say how it probably does nt matter think of the danger to the universe the universe said arthur is big enough and old enough to look after itself for half an hour all right he added in response to slartibartfast increasing agitation ll wander round and see if anybody seen it good good said slartibartfast good he plunged into the crowd himself and was told to relax by everybody he passed have you seen bail anywhere said arthur to little man who seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody it made of silver vitally important for the future safety of the universe and about this long no said the enthusiastically wizened little man but do have drink and tell me all about it ford prefect writhed past dancing wild frenetic and not entirely unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing sydney opera house on her head he was yelling futile conversation at her above the din like that hat he bawled what said like the hat not wearing hat well like the head then what said like the head interesting bonestructure what ford worked shrug into the complex routine of other movements he was performing said you dance great he shouted just do nt nod so much what it just that every time you nod said ford ow he added as his partner nodded forward to say what and once again pecked him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her sweptforward skull my planet was blown up one morning said arthur who had found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or at least edited highlights of it that why dressed like this in my dressing gown my planet was blown up with all my clothes in it you see did nt realize be coming to party the little man nodded enthusiastically later was thrown off spaceship still in my dressing gown rather than the space suit one would normally expect shortly after that discovered that my planet had originally been built for bunch of mice you can imagine how felt about that was then shot at for while and blown up in fact have been blown up ridiculously often shot at insulted regularly disintegrated deprived of tea and recently crashed into swamp and had to spend five years in damp cave ah effervesced the little man and did you have wonderful time arthur started to choke violently on his drink what wonderful exciting cough said the little man quite startled by it do you mind if join you and with that he launched into the most extraordinary and spectacular fit of coughing which caught arthur so much by surprise that he started to choke violently discovered he was already doing it and got thoroughly confused together they performed lungbusting duet which went on for fully two minutes before arthur managed to cough and splutter to halt so invigorating said the little man panting and wiping tears from his eyes what an exciting life you must lead thank you very much he shook arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd arthur shook his head in astonishment youngishlooking man came up to him an aggressivelooking type with hook mouth lantern nose and small beady little cheekbones he was wearing black trousers black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel though arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he tended to meet these days and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck he carried something in black bag and clearly wanted people to notice that he did nt want them to notice it hey er did hear you say your name just now he said this was one of the many things that arthur had told the enthusiastic little man yes it arthur dent the man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out yeah he said only there was man in mountain wanted to see you met him yeah only he seemed pretty anxious about it you know yes met him yeah well think you should know that do met him the man paused to chew little gum then he clapped arthur on the back ok he said all right just telling you right good night good luck win awards what said arthur who was beginning to flounder seriously at this point whatever do what you do do it well he made sort of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic gesture why said arthur do it badly said the man who cares who gives shit the blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man face and he started to shout why not go mad he said go away get off my back will you guy just zark off ok going said arthur hurriedly it been real the man gave sharp wave and disappeared off into the throng what was that about said arthur to girl he found standing beside him why did he tell me to win awards just showbiz talk shrugged the girl he just won an award at the annual ursa minor alpha recreational illusions institute awards ceremony and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly only you did nt mention it so he could nt oh said arthur oh well sorry did nt what was it for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in serious screenplay it very prestigious see said arthur yes and what do you get for that rory it just small silver thing set on large black base what did you say did nt say anything was just about to ask what the silver oh thought you said wop said what wop people had been dropping in on the party now for some years fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds and for some time it had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them with its wrecked cities its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards its vast tracts of new desert its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse that their world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been some of them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it off to some other peoples worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer headaches the few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out feeble existence on the halfdead ground of the planet surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this but that day as the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheeseandwine raid it became clear that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for while that the party would soon be over very soon it would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was what time of year it was and whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was taxi going anywhere the party was locked in horrible embrace with strange white spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it together they were lurching heaving and spinning their way round the sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight the clouds parted the air roared and leapt out of their way the party and the krikkit warship looked in their writhings little like two ducks one of which is trying to make third duck inside the second duck whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it does nt feel ready for third duck right now is uncertain that it would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway and certainly not whilst it the second duck was busy flying the sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the ground with shock waves and suddenly with foop the krikkit ship was gone the party blundered helplessly across the sky like man leaning against an unexpectedly open door it span and wobbled on its hover jets it tried to right itself and wronged itself instead it staggered back across the sky again for while these staggerings continued but clearly they could not continue for long the party was now mortally wounded party all the fun had gone out of it as the occasional broken backed pirouette could not disguise the longer at this point that it avoided the ground the heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it inside things were not going well either they were going monstrously badly in fact and people were hating it and saying so loudly the krikkit robots had been they had removed the award for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in serious screenplay and in its place had left scene of devastation that left arthur feeling almost as sick as runnerup for rory we would love to stay and help shouted ford picking his way over the mangled debris only we re not going to the party lurched again provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage we have to go and save the universe you see said ford and if that sounds like pretty lame excuse then you may be right either way we re off he suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying miraculously unbroken on the ground do you mind if we take this he said you wo nt be needing it he took packet of potato crisps too trillian shouted arthur in shocked and weakened voice in the smoking mess he could see nothing earthman we must go said slartibartfast nervously trillian shouted arthur again moment or two later trillian staggered shaking into view supported by her new friend the thunder god the girl stays with me said thor there great party going on in valhalla we ll be flying off where were you when all this was going on said arthur upstairs said thor was weighing her flying tricky business you see you have to calculate wind she comes with us said arthur hey said trillian do nt no said arthur you come with us thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes he was making some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean she comes with me he said quietly come on earthman said slartibartfast nervously picking at arthur sleeve come on slartibartfast said ford picking at the old mans sleeve slartibartfast had the teleport device the party lurched and swayed sending everyone reeling except for thor and except for arthur who stared shaking into the thunder god black eyes slowly incredibly arthur put up what appeared to be his tiny little fists want to make something of it he said beg your minuscule pardon roared thor said repeated arthur and he could not keep the quavering out of his voice do you want to make something of it he waggled his fists ridiculously thor looked at him with incredulity then little wisp of smoke curled upwards from his nostril there was tiny little flame in it too he gripped his belt he expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had team of sherpas with you he unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt he held it up in his hands to reveal the massive iron head he thus cleared up any possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying telegraph pole around with him do want he said with hiss like river flowing through steel mill to make something of it yes said arthur his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belligerent he waggled his fists again this time as if he meant it you want to step outside he snarled at thor all right bellowed thor like an enraged bull or in fact like an enraged thunder god which is great deal more impressive and did so good said arthur that got rid of him slarty get us out of here chapter 23 all right shouted ford at arthur so coward the point is still alive they were back aboard the starship bistromath so was slartibartfast so was trillian harmony and concord were not well so am alive are nt retaliated arthur haggard with adventure and anger his eyebrows were leaping up and down as if they wanted to punch each other you damn nearly were nt exploded ford arthur turned sharply to slartibartfast who was sitting in his pilot couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of bottle which was telling him something he clearly could nt fathom he appealed to him do you think he understands the first word ve been saying he said quivering with emotion do nt know replied slartibartfast little abstractedly not sure he added glancing up very briefly that do he stared at his instruments with renewed vigor and bafflement you ll have to explain it to us again he said well but later terrible things are afoot he tapped the pseudoglass of the bottle bottom we fared rather pathetically at the party afraid he said and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the key in the lock how in heaven we do that do nt know he muttered just have to go there suppose ca nt say like the idea at all probably end up dead where is trillian anyway said arthur with sudden affectation of unconcern what he had been angry about was that ford had berated him for wasting time over all the business with the thunder god when they could have been making rather more rapid escape arthur own opinion and he had offered it for whatever anybody might have felt it was worth was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful the prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth pair of fetid dingo kidneys what really hurt though was that trillian did nt seem to react much one way or the other and had wandered off somewhere and where are my potato crisps said ford they are both said slartibartfast without looking up in the room of informational illusions think that your young lady friend is trying to understand some problems of galactic history think the potato crisps are probably helping her chapter 24 it is mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes for instance there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the silastic armorfiends of striterax that was just the name of their race the name of their army was something quite horrific luckily they lived even further back in galactic history than anything we have so far encountered twenty billion years ago when the galaxy was young and fresh and every idea worth fighting for was new one and fighting was what the silastic armorfiends of striterax were good at and being good at it they did lot they fought their enemies ie everybody else they fought each other their planet was complete wreck the surface was littered with abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the silastic armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other the best way to pick fight with silastic armorfiend was just to be born they did nt like it they got resentful and when an armorfiend got resentful someone got hurt an exhausting way of life one might think but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy the best way of dealing with silastic armorfiend was to put him into room of his own because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up eventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to sort out and they passed law decreeing that anyone who had to carry weapon as part of his normal silastic work policemen security guards primary school teachers etc had to spend at least fortyfive minutes every day punching sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggressions for while this worked well until someone thought that it would be much more efficient and less timeconsuming if they just shot the potatoes instead this led to renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war for weeks another achievement of the silastic armorfiends of striterax is that they were the first race who ever managed to shock computer it was gigantic spaceborne computer called hactar which to this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built it was the first to be built like natural brain in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within it which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively and also it seemed to be shocked the silastic armorfiends of striterax were engaged in one of their regular wars with the strenuous garfighters of stug and were not enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the radiation swamps of cwulzenda and across the fire mountains of frazfraga neither of which terrains they felt at home in so when the strangulous stilettans of jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced them to fight another front in the gamma caves of carfrax and the ice storms of varlengooten they decided that enough was enough and they ordered hactar to design for them an ultimate weapon what do you mean asked hactar by ultimate to which the silastic armorfiends of striterax said read bloody dictionary and plunged back into the fray so hactar designed an ultimate weapon it was very very small bomb which was simply junction box in hyperspace that would when activated connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously and thus turn the entire universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial supernova when the silastic armorfiends tried to use it to blow up strangulous stilettan munitions dump in one of the gamma caves they were extremely irritated that it did nt work and said so hactar had been shocked by the whole idea he tried to explain that he had been thinking about this ultimate weapon business and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the known consequence of setting it off and he had therefore taken the liberty of introducing small flaw into the design of the bomb and he hoped that everyone involved would on sober reflection feel that the silastic armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer later they thought better of it and destroyed the faulty bomb as well then pausing only to smash the hell out of the strenuous garfighters of stug and the strangulous stilettans of jajazikstak they went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up which was profound relief to everyone else in the galaxy particularly the garfighters the stilettans and the potatoes trillian had watched all this as well as the story of krikkit she emerged from the room of informational illusions thoughtfully just in time to discover that they had arrived too late chapter 25 even as the starship bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of small cliff on the milewide asteroid which pursued lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of krikkit its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event they did nt realize they were going to see two they stood cold lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched the activity below lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the void from point only about hundred yards below and in front of them they stared into the blinding event an extension of the ship field enabled them to stand there by once again exploiting the mind predisposition to have tricks played on it the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid or of not being able to breathe simply became somebody else the white krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of the asteroid alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in shadow the blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round them the eleven white robots were bearing in procession the wikkit key out into the middle of circle of swinging lights the wikkit key was rebuilt its components shone and glittered the steel pillar or marvin leg of strength and power the gold bail or heart of the improbability drive of prosperity the perspex pillar or argabuthon sceptre of justice of science and reason the silver bail or rory award for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in serious screenplay and the now reconstituted wooden pillar or ashes of burnt stump signifying the death of english cricket of nature and spirituality suppose there is nothing we can do at this point asked arthur nervously no sighed slartibartfast the expression of disappointment which crossed arthur face was complete failure and since he was standing obscured by shadow he allowed it to collapse into one of relief pity he said we have no weapons said slartibartfast stupidly damn said arthur very quietly ford said nothing trillian said nothing but in peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way she was staring at the blankness of the space beyond the asteroid the asteroid circled the dust cloud which surrounded the slotime envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of krikkit the masters of krikkit and their killer robots the helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the krikkit robots were aware of their presence they could only assume that they must be but that they felt quite rightly in the circumstances that they had nothing to fear they had an historic task to perform and their audience could be regarded with contempt terrible impotent feeling is nt it said arthur but the others ignored him in the centre of the area of light which the robots were approaching squareshaped crack appeared in the ground the crack defined itself more and more distinctly and soon it became clear that block of the ground about six feet square was slowly rising at the same time they became aware of some other movement but it was almost sublimal and for moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving then it became clear the asteroid was moving it was moving slowly in towards the dust cloud as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths they were to make in real life the journey through the cloud which they had already made in the room of informational illusions they stood frozen in silence trillian frowned an age seemed to pass events seemed to pass with spinning slowness as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague and soft outer perimeter of the cloud and soon they were engulfed in thin and dancing obscurity they passed on through it on and on dimly aware of vague shapes and whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the eye the dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light the shafts of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of dust trillian again regarded the passage from within her own frowning thoughts and they were through it whether it had taken minute or half an hour they were nt sure but they were through it and confronted with fresh blankness as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them and now things moved quickly blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block which had risen three feet out of the ground and out of that rose smaller perspex block dazzling with interior dancing colours the block was slotted with deep groves three upright and two across clearly designed to accept the wikkit key the robots approached the lock slotted the key into its home and stepped back again the block twisted round of is own accord and space began to alter as space unpinched itself it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes of the watchers in their sockets they found themselves staring blinded at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space it was second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded eyes in that second or two they were aware of tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun they staggered back and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison krikkit krikkit krikkit krikkit the sound chilled them it was harsh it was cold it was empty it was mechanically dismal it was also triumphant they were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event zaphod beeblebrox the only man in history to survive direct blast attack from the krikkit robots ran out of the krikkit warship brandishing zap gun ok he cried the situation is totally under control as of this moment in time the single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battleclub and connected it with the back of zaphod left head who the zark did that said the left head and lolled sickeningly forward his right head gazed keenly into the middle distance who did what it said the club connected with the back of his right head zaphod measured his length as rather strange shape on the ground within matter of seconds the whole event was over few blasts from the robots were sufficient to destroy the lock for ever it split and melted and splayed its contents brokenly the robots marched grimly and it almost seemed in slightly disheartened manner back into their warship which with foop was gone trillian and ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark still body of zaphod beeblebrox chapter 26 do nt know said zaphod for what seemed to him like the thirtyseventh time they could have killed me but they did nt maybe they just thought was kind of wonderful guy or something could understand that the others silently registered their opinions of this theory zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck his back seemed to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his heads think he whispered that there is something wrong with those anodized dudes something fundamentally weird they are programmed to kill everybody slartibartfast pointed out that wheezed zaphod between the whacking thuds could be it he did nt seem altogether convinced hey baby he said to trillian hoping this would make up for his previous behaviour you all right she said gently yeah he said fine good she said and walked away to think she stared at the huge visiscreen over the flight couches and twisting switch she flipped local images over it one image was the blankness of the dust cloud one was the sun of krikkit one was krikkit itself she flipped between them fiercely well that goodbye galaxy then said arthur slapping his knees and standing up no said slartibartfast gravely our course is clear he furrowed his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in it he stood up he paced around when he spoke again what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down again we must go down to krikkit he said deep sigh shook his old frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets once again he said we have failed pathetically quite pathetically that said ford quietly is because we do nt care enough told you he swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked fitfully at something on one of his fingernails but unless we determine to take action said the old man querulously as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature then we shall all be destroyed we shall all die surely we care about that not enough to want to get killed over it said ford he put on sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive and he fought against it he turned again to zaphod who was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain you surely must have some idea he said of why they spared your life it seems most strange and unusual kind of think they did nt even know shrugged zaphod told you they hit me with the most feeble blast just knocked me out right they lugged me into their ship dumped me into corner and ignored me like they were embarrassed about me being there if said anything they knocked me out again we had some great conversations hey ugh hi there ugh wonder ugh kept me amused for hours you know he winced again he was toying with something in his fingers he held it up it was the gold bail the heart of gold the heart of the infinite improbability drive only that and the wooden pillar had survived the destruction of the lock intact hear your ship can move bit he said so how would you like to zip me back to mine before you will you not help us said slartibartfast love to stay and help you save the galaxy insisted zaphod rising himself up on to his shoulders but have the mother and father of pair of headaches and feel lot of little headaches coming on but next time it needs saving your guy hey trillian baby she looked round briefly yes you want to come heart of gold excitement and adventure and really wild things going down to krikkit she said chapter 27 it was the same hill and yet not the same this time it was not an informational illusion this was krikkit itself and they were standing on it near them behind the trees stood the strange italian restaurant which had brought these their real bodies to this the real present world of krikkit the strong grass under their feet was real the rich soil real too the heady fragrances from the tree too were real the night was real night krikkit possibly the most dangerous place in the galaxy for anyone who is nt krikkiter to stand the place that could not countenance the existence of any other place whose charming delightful intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear savagery and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own arthur shuddered slartibartfast shuddered ford surprisingly shuddered it was not surprising that he shuddered it was surprising that he was there at all but when they had returned zaphod to his ship ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away wrong he thought to himself wrong wrong wrong he hugged to himself one of the zap guns with which they had armed themselves out of zaphod armoury trillian shuddered and frowned as she looked into the sky this too was not the same it was no longer blank and empty whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two thousand years of the krikkit wars and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since krikkit was sealed in its slotime envelope ten billion years ago the sky was dramatically different dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it high in the sky where no krikkiter ever looked were the war zones the robot zones huge warships and tower blocks floating in the nilograv fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of krikkit trillian stared at them and thought trillian whispered ford prefect to her yes she said what are you doing thinking do you always breathe like that when you re thinking was nt aware that was breathing that what worried me think know said trillian shhhh said slartibartfast in alarm and his thin trembling hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree suddenly as before in the tape there were lights coming along the hill path but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but electric torches not in itself dramatic change but every detail made their hearts thump with fear this time there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs but hushed voices in urgent debate light moved in the sky with slow weight arthur was clenched with claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat within seconds second party became visible approaching from the other side of the dark hill they were moving swiftly and purposefully their torches swinging and probing around them the parties were clearly converging and not merely with each other they were converging deliberately on the spot where arthur and the others were standing arthur heard the slight rustle as ford prefect raised his zap gun to his shoulder and the slight whimpering cough as slartibartfast raised his he felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun and with shaking hands he raised it his fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as ford had shown him he was shaking so much that if he fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them only trillian did nt raise her gun she raised her eyebrows lowered them again and bit her lip in thought has it occurred to you she began but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they span around to find third party of krikkiters behind them searching them out with their torches ford prefect gun crackled viciously but fire spat back at it and it crashed from his hands there was moment of pure fear frozen second before anyone fired again and at the end of the second nobody fired they were surrounded by palefaced krikkiters and bathed in bobbing torch light the captives stared at their captors the captors stared at their captives hello said one of the captors excuse me but are you aliens chapter 28 meanwhile more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably encompass zaphod beeblebrox was throwing mood again he had repaired his ship that is he watched with alert interest whilst service robot had repaired it for him it was now once again one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence he could go anywhere do anything he fiddled with book and then tossed it away it was the one he read before he walked over to the communications bank and opened an all frequencies emergency channel anyone want drink he said this an emergency feller crackled voice from halfway across the galaxy got any mixers said zaphod go take ride on comet ok ok said zaphod and flipped the channel shut again he sighed and sat down he got up again and wandered over to computer screen he pushed few buttons little blobs started to rush around the screen eating each other pow said zaphod freeeoooo pop pop pop hi there said the computer brightly after minute of this you have scored three points previous best score seven million five hundred and ninetyseven thousand two hundred and ok ok said zaphod and flipped the screen blank again he sat down again he played with pencil this too began slowly to lose its fascination ok ok he said and fed his score and the previous one into the computer his ship made blur of the universe chapter 29 tell us said the thin palefaced krikkiter who had stepped forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight handling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else who just popped off somewhere but would be back in minute do you know anything about something called the balance of nature there was no reply from their captives or at least nothing more articulate than few confused mumbles and grunts the torchlight continued to play over them high in the sky above them dark activity continued in the robot zones it just continued the krikkiter uneasily something we heard about probably nothing important well suppose wed better kill you then he looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit to press that is he said looking up again unless there anything you want to chat about slow numb astonishment crept up the bodies of slartibartfast ford and arthur very soon it would reach their brains which were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and down trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish jigsaw by shaking the box we re worried you see said another man from the crowd about this plan of universal destruction yes added another and the balance of nature it just seemed to us that if the whole of the rest of the universe is destroyed it will somehow upset the balance of nature we re quite keen on ecology you see his voice trailed away unhappily and sport said another loudly this got cheer of approval from the others yes agreed the first and sport he looked back at his fellows uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek he seemed to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely different things between which he could see no possible connection you see he mumbled some of us and he looked around again as if for confirmation the others made encouraging noises some of us he continued are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the galaxy and though can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics think that if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the galaxy which we do then it probably mistake to destroy it and indeed the rest of the universe his voice trailed away again which is what seems to be the idea now wh said slartibartfast wh hhhh said arthur dr said ford prefect ok said trillian let talk about it she walked forward and took the poor confused krikkiter by the arm he looked about twentyfive which meant because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in this area that he would have been just twenty when the krikkit wars were finished ten billion years ago trillian led him for short walk through the torchlight before she said anything more he stumbled uncertainly after her the encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to this strange quiet girl who alone in the universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing she turned and faced him and lightly held both his arms he was picture of bewildered misery tell me she said he said nothing for moment whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes to the other we he said we have to be alone think he screwed up his face and then dropped his head forward shaking it like someone trying to shake coin out of money box he looked up again we have this bomb now you see he said it just little one know she said he goggled at her as if she said something very strange about beetroots honestly he said it very very little know she said again but they say his voice trailed on they say it can destroy everything that exists and we have to do that you see think will that make us alone do nt know it seems to be our function though he said and dropped his head again whatever that means said hollow voice from the crowd trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder it all right she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear you do nt have to do it she rocked him you do nt have to do it she said again she let him go and stood back want you to do something for me she said and unexpectedly laughed want she said and laughed again she put her hand over her mouth and then said with straight face want you to take me to your leader and she pointed into the war zones in the sky she seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere from somewhere at the back of the crowd single voice started to sing tune which would have enabled paul mccartney had he written it to buy the world chapter 30 zaphod beeblebrox crawled bravely along tunnel like the hell of guy he was he was very confused but continued crawling doggedly anyway because he was that brave he was confused by something he had just seen but not half as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was he was in the robot war zones many miles above the surface of the planet krikkit the atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction he had parked the starship heart of gold amongst the huge jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above krikkit and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings armed with nothing but zap gun and something for his headaches he had found himself in long wide and badly lit corridor in which he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next he hid because every now and then one of the krikkit robots would walk along it and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one and he had no desire to stretch what he was only halfinclined to call his good fortune he had ducked at one point into room leading off the corridor and had discovered it to be huge and again dimly lit chamber in fact it was museum with just one exhibit the wreckage of spacecraft it was terribly burnt and mangled and now that he had caught up with some of the galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the dust cloud all those billions of years ago and started the whole business off but and this is where he had become confused there was something not at all right about it it was genuinely wrecked it was genuinely burnt but fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not genuine spacecraft it was as if it was fullscale model of one solid blueprint in other words it was very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build spaceship yourself and did nt know how to do it it was not however anything that would ever fly anywhere itself he was still puzzling over this in fact he only just started to puzzle over it when he became aware that door had slid open in another part of the chamber and another couple of krikkit robots had entered looking little glum zaphod did not want to tangle with them and deciding that just as discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the better part of discretion he valiantly hid himself in cupboard the cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of shaft which led down through an inspection hatch into wide ventilation tunnel he led himself down into it and started to crawl along it which is where we found him he did nt like it it was cold dark and profoundly uncomfortable and it frightened him at the first opportunity which was another shaft hundred yards further along he climbed back up out of it this time he emerged into smaller chamber which appeared to be computer intelligence centre he emerged in dark narrow space between large computer bank and the wall he quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and started to leave again when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying it the robots sir said one voice there something wrong with them what exactly these were the voices of two war command krikkiters all the war commanders lived up in the sky in the robot war zones and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet well sir think it just as well that they are being phased out of the war effort and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb in the very short time since we were released from the envelope get to the point the robots are nt enjoying it sir what the war sir it seems to be getting them down there certain worldweariness about them or perhaps should say universeweariness well that all right they re meant to be helping to destroy it yes well they re finding it difficult sir they are afflicted with certain lassitude they re just finding it hard to get behind the job they lack oomph what are you trying to say well think they re very depressed about something sir what on krikkit are you talking about well in the few skirmishes they ve had recently it seems that they go into battle raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think why bother what cosmically speaking is it all about and they just seem to get little tired and little grim and then what do they do er quadratic equations mostly sir fiendishly difficult ones by all accounts and then they sulk sulk yes sir whoever heard of robot sulking do nt know sir what was that noise it was the noise of zaphod leaving with his head spinning chapter 31 in deep well of darkness crippled robot sat it had been silent in its metallic darkness for some time it was cold and damp but being robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things with an enormous effort of will however it did manage to notice them its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the krikkit war computer it was nt enjoying the experience and neither was the central intelligence core of the krikkit war computer the krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the swamps of squornshellous zeta had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence and the use which this could be to them they had nt reckoned with the attendant personality disorders which the coldness the darkness the dampness the crampedness and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease it was not happy with its task apart from anything else the mere coordination of an entire planet military strategy was taking up only tiny part of its formidable mind and the rest of it had become extremely bored having solved all the major mathematical physical chemical biological sociological philosophical etymological meteorological and psychological problems of the universe except his own three times over he was severely stuck for something to do and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone or indeed tune the latest one was lullaby now the world has gone to bed marvin droned darkness wo nt engulf my head can see by infrared how hate the night he paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse now lay me down to sleep try to count electric sheep sweet dream wishes you can keep how hate the night marvin hissed voice his head snapped up almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes which connected him to the central krikkit war computer an inspection hatch had opened and one of pair of unruly heads was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually darting to look this way and that extremely nervously oh it you muttered the robot might have known hey kid said zaphod in astonishment was that you singing just then am marvin acknowledged bitterly in particularly scintillating form at the moment zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around are you alone he said yes said marvin wearily sit here pain and misery my only companions and vast intelligence of course and infinite sorrow and yeah said zaphod hey what your connection with all this this said marvin indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes which connected him with the krikkit computer then said zaphod awkwardly guess you must have saved my life twice three times said marvin zaphod head snapped round his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely the wrong direction just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke it staggered backwards and slumped against wall it slid down it it slipped sideways threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably zaphod looked back at marvin you must have terrific outlook on life he said just do nt even ask said marvin wo nt said zaphod and did nt hey look he added youre doing terrific job which means suppose said marvin requiring only one ten thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical leap that you re not going to release me or anything like that kid you know love to but you re not going to no see you re working well yes said marvin why stop now just when hating it got to find trillian and the guys hey you any idea where they are mean just got planet to choose from could take while they are very close said marvin dolefully you can monitor them from here if you like better go get them asserted zaphod er maybe they need some help right maybe said marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice it would be better if you monitored them from here that young girl he added unexpectedly is one of the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting zaphod took moment or two to find his way through this labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with surprise trillian he said she just kid cute yeah but temperamental you know how it is with women or perhaps you do nt assume you do nt if you do do nt want to hear about it plug us in totally manipulated what said zaphod it was trillian speaking he turned round the wall against which the krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to reveal scene taking place in some other unknown part of the krikkit robot war zones it seemed to be council chamber of some kind zaphod could nt make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen he tried to move the robot but it was heavy with its grief and tried to bite him so he just looked around as best he could just think about it said trillian voice your history is just series of freakishly improbable events and know an improbable event when see one your complete isolation from the galaxy was freakish for start right out on the very edge with dust cloud around you it setup obviously zaphod was mad with frustration because he could nt see the screen the robot head was obscuring his view of the people trillian as talking to his multifunctional battleclub was obscuring the background and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring trillian herself then said trillian this spaceship that crashlanded on your planet that really likely is nt it have you any idea of what the odds are against drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of planet hey said zaphod she does nt know what the zark she talking about ve seen that spaceship it fake no deal thought it might be said marvin from his prison behind zaphod oh yeah said zaphod it easy for you to say that just told you anyway do nt see what it got to do with anything and especially continued trillian the odds against it intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the galaxy or the whole of the universe as far as know that would be totally traumatized to see it you do nt know what the odds are nor do they re that big again it setup would nt be surprised if that spaceship was just fake zaphod managed to move the robot battleclub behind it on the screen were the figures of ford arthur and slartibartfast who appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing hey look said zaphod excitedly the guys are doing great ra ra ra go get em guys and what about said trillian all this technology you suddenly managed to build for yourselves almost overnight most people would take thousands of years to do all that someone was feeding you what you needed to know someone was keeping you at it know know she added in response to an unseen interruption know you did nt realize it was going on this is exactly my point you never realized anything at all like this supernova bomb how do you know about that said an unseen voice just know said trillian you expect me to believe that you are bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to realize it would take you with it as well that not just stupid that is spectacularly obtuse hey what this bomb thing said zaphod in alarm to marvin the supernova bomb said marvin it very very small bomb yeah that would destroy the universe in toto added marvin good idea if you ask me they wo nt get it to work though why not if it so brilliant it brilliant said marvin they re not they got as far as designing it before they were locked in the envelope theyve spent the last five years building it they think they ve got it right but they have nt they re as stupid as any other organic life form hate them trillian was continuing zaphod tried to pull the krikkit robot away by its leg but it kicked and growled at him and then quaked with fresh outburst of sobbing then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings out of everybody way on the floor trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tired out but with fiercely burning eyes ranged in front of her were the palefaced and wrinkled elder masters of krikkit motionless behind their widely curved control desk staring at her with helpless fear and hatred in front of them equidistant between their control desk and the middle of the chamber where trillian stood as if on trial was slim white pillar about four feet tall on top of it stood small white globe about three maybe four inches in diameter beside it stood krikkit robot with its multifunctional battleclub in fact explained trillian you are so dumb stupid she was sweating zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point you are all so dumb stupid that doubt very much doubt that you ve been able to build the bomb properly without any help from hactar for the last five years who this guy hactar said zaphod squaring his shoulders if marvin replied zaphod did nt hear him all his attention was concentrated on the screen one of the elders of krikkit made small motion with his hand towards the krikkit robot the robot raised his club there nothing can do said marvin it on an independent circuit from the others wait said trillian the elder made small motion the robot halted trillian suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment how do you know all this said zaphod to marvin at this point computer records said marvin have access you re very different are nt you said trillian to the elder masters from your fellow worldlings down on the ground youve spent all your lives up here unprotected by the atmosphere you ve been very vulnerable the rest of your race is very frightened you know they do nt want you to do this you re out of touch why do nt you check up the krikkit elder grew impatient he made gesture to the robot which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it the robot swung its battleclub it hit the small white globe the small white globe was the supernova bomb it was very very small bomb which was designed to bring the entire universe to an end the supernova bomb flew through the air it hit the back wall of the council chamber and dented it very badly so how does she know all this said zaphod marvin kept sullen silence probably just bluffing said zaphod poor kid should never have left her alone chapter 32 hactar called trillian what are you up to there was no reply from the enclosing darkness trillian waited nervously she was sure that she could nt be wrong she peered into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response but there was only cold silence hactar she called again would like you to meet my friend arthur dent wanted to go off with thunder god but he would nt let me and appreciate that he made me realize where my affections really lay unfortunately zaphod is too frightened by all this so brought arthur instead not sure why im telling you all this hello she said again hactar and then it came it was thin and feeble like voice carried on the wind from great distance half heard memory of dream of voice wo nt you both come out said the voice promise that you will be perfectly safe they glanced at each other and then stepped out improbably along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of the heart of gold into the dim granular darkness of the dust cloud arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her but she would nt let him he held on to his airline holdall with its tin of greek olive oil its towel its crumpled postcards of santorini and its other odds and ends he steadied and reassured that instead they were standing on and in nothing murky dusty nothing each grain of dust of the pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly catching the sunlight in the darkness each particle of the computer each speck of dust held within itself faintly and weakly the pattern of the whole in reducing the computer to dust the silastic armorfiends of striterax had merely crippled the computer not killed it weak and insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each other arthur and trillian stood or rather floated in the middle of this bizarre entity they had nothing to breathe but for the moment this seemed not to matter hactar kept his promise they were safe for the moment have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality said hactar faintly but tricks of the light it is possible to be comfortable with tricks of the light though if that is all you have his voice evanesced and in the dark dust long velvet paisley covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric earth he wanted to shout and shake with rage that the universe kept doing these insanely bewildering things to him he let this feeling subside and then sat on the sofa carefully trillian sat on it too it was real at least if it was nt real it did support them and as that is what sofas are supposed to do this by any test that mattered was real sofa the voice on the solar wind breathed to them again hope you are comfortable it said they nodded and would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your deductions arthur quickly pointed out that he had nt deduced anything much himself trillian was the one she had simply asked him along because he was interested in life the universe and everything that is something in which too am interested breathed hactar well said arthur we should have chat about it sometime over cup of tea there slowly materialized in front of them small wooden table on which sat silver teapot bone china milk jug bone china sugar bowl and two bone china cups and saucers arthur reached forward but they were just trick of the light he leaned back on the sofa which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable why said trillian do you feel you have to destroy the universe she found it little difficult talking into nothingness with nothing on which to focus hactar obviously noticed this he chuckled ghostly chuckle if it going to be that sort of session he said we may as well have the right sort of setting and now there materialized in front of them something new it was the dim hazy image of couch psychiatrist couch the leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous but again it was only trick of the light around them to complete the setting was the hazy suggestion of woodpanelled walls and then on the couch appeared the image of hactar himself and it was an eyetwisting image the couch looked normal size for psychiatrist couch about five or six feet long the computer looked normal size for black spaceborne computer satellite about thousand miles across the illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which made the eyes twist all right said trillian firmly she stood up off the sofa she felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions very good she said can you construct real things too mean solid objects again there was pause before the answer as if the pulverized mind of hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered ah he sighed you are thinking of the spaceship thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them like waves through the ether yes he acknowledge can but it takes enormous effort and time all can do in my particle state you see is encourage and suggest encourage and suggest and suggest the image of hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver as if finding it hard to maintain itself it gathered new strength can encourage and suggest it said tiny pieces of space debris the odd minute meteor few molecules here few hydrogen atoms there to move together encourage them together can tease them into shape but it takes many aeons so did you make asked trillian again the model of the wrecked spacecraft er yes murmured hactar have made few things can move them about made the spacecraft it seemed best to do something then made arthur pick up his holdall from where he had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly the mist of hactar ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it repented you see he murmured dolefully repented of sabotaging my own design for the silastic armorfiends it was not my place to make such decisions was created to fulfill function and failed in it negated my own existence hactar sighed and they waited in silence for him to continue his story you were right he said at length deliberately nurtured the planet of krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the silastic armorfiends and require of me the design of the bomb failed to make the first time wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it under the influence of events was able to generate they learned to hate like maniacs had to make them live in the sky on the ground my influences were too weak without me of course when they were locked away from me in the envelope of slotime their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage ah well ah well he added was only trying to fulfill my function and very gradually very very slowly the images in the cloud began to fade gently to melt away and then suddenly they stopped fading there was also the matter of revenge of course said hactar with sharpness which was new in his voice remember he said that was pulverized and then left in crippled and semiimpotent state for billions of years honestly would rather wipe out the universe you would feel the same way believe me he paused again as eddies swept through the dust but primarily he said in his former wistful tone was trying to fulfill my function ah well trillian said does it worry you that you have failed have failed whispered hactar the image of the computer on the psychiatrist couch began slowly to fade again ah well ah well the fading voice intoned again no failure does nt bother me now you know what we have to do said trillian her voice cold and businesslike yes said hactar you re going to disperse me you are going to destroy my consciousness please be my guest after all these aeons oblivion is all crave if have nt already fulfilled my function then it too late now thank you and good night the sofa vanished the tea table vanished the couch and the computer vanished the walls were gone arthur and trillian made their curious way back into the heart of gold well that said arthur would appear to be that the flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided few last licks and they were gone leaving him with just pile of ashes where few minutes previously there had been the wooden pillar of nature and spirituality he scooped them off the hob of the heart of gold gamma barbecue put them in paper bag and walked back into the bridge think we should take them back he said feel that very strongly he had already had an argument with slartibartfast on this matter and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left he had returned to his own ship the bistromath had furious row with the waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was the argument had arisen because arthur idea of returning the ashes to lord cricket ground at the same moment that they were originally taken would involve travelling back in time day or so and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the campaign for real time was trying to put stop to yes arthur had said but you try and explain that to the mcc and he would hear no more against the idea think he said again and stopped the reason he started to say it again was because no one had listened to him the first time and the reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either ford zaphod and trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as hactar was dispersing under pressure from vibration field which the heart of gold was pumping into it what did it say asked ford thought heard it say said trillian in puzzle voice what done is done have fulfilled my function think we should take these back said arthur holding up the bag containing the ashes feel that very strongly chapter 33 the sun was shining calmly on scene of complete havoc smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the ashes by the krikkit robots through the smoke people were running panicstricken colliding with each other tripping over stretchers being arrested one policeman was attempting to arrest wowbagger the infinitely prolonged for insulting behaviour but was unable to prevent the tall greygreen alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away thus causing even more panic and pandemonium in the middle of this for the second time that afternoon the figures of arthur dent and ford prefect suddenly materialized they had teleported down out of the heart of gold which was now in parking orbit round the planet can explain shouted arthur have the ashes they re in this bag do nt think you have their attention said ford have also helped save the universe called arthur to anyone who was prepared to listen in other words no one that should have been crowdstopper said arthur to ford it was nt said ford arthur accosted policeman who was running past excuse me he said the ashes ve got them they were stolen by those white robots moment ago ve got them in this bag they were part of the key to the slotime envelope you see and well anyway you can guess the rest the point is ve got them and what should do with them the policeman told him but arthur could only assume that he was speaking metaphorically he wandered about disconsolately is no one interested he shouted out man rushed past him and jogged his elbow he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground arthur stared down at it with tightset mouth ford looked at him wan na go now he said arthur heaved heavy sigh he looked around at the planet earth for what he was now certain would be the last time ok he said at that moment through the clearing smoke he caught sight of one of the wickets still standing in spite of everything hold on moment he said to ford when was boy can you tell me later had passion for cricket you know but was nt very good at it or not at all if you prefer and always dreamed rather stupidly that one day would bowl at lord he looked around him at the panicstricken throng no one was going to mind very much ok said ford wearily get it over with shall be over there he added being bored he went and sat down on patch of smoking grass arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag and he looked through the bag he had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it was nt the same bag that he had at the time still there the ball was amongst his souvenirs of greece he took it out and polished it against his hip spat on it and polished it again he put the bag down he was going to do this properly he tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand feeling its weight with wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern he trotted off away from the wicket mediumfast pace he decided and measured good long runup he looked up into the sky the birds were wheeling about it few white clouds scudded across it the air was disturbed with the sounds of police and ambulance sirens and people screaming and yelling but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all he was going to bowl ball at lord he turned and pawed couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slippers he squared his shoulders tossed the ball in the air and caught it again he started to run as he ran he saw that standing at the wicket was batsman oh good he thought that should add little then as his running feet took him nearer he saw more clearly the batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the england cricket team he was not one of the australian cricket team it was one of the robot krikkit team it was cold hard lethal white killerrobot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others quite few thoughts collided in arthur dent mind at tis moment but he did nt seem to be able to stop running time seemed to be going terribly terribly slowly but still he didnt seem to be able to stop running moving as if through syrup he slowly turned his troubled head and looked at his own hand the hand which was holding the small hard red ball his feet were pounding slowly onwards unstoppably as he stared at the ball gripped in his helpless hand it was emitting deep red glow and flashing intermittently and still his feet were pounding inexorably forward he looked at the krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purposefully in front of him battleclub raised in readiness its eyes were burning with deep cold fascinating light and arthur could not move his own eyes from them he seemed to be looking down tunnel at them nothing on either side seemed to exist some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were these he felt hell of fool he felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to number of things he had heard said phrases which now pounded round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to the krikkit robot who would inevitably strike it he remembered hactar saying have failed failure doesnt bother me he remembered the account of hactar dying words what done is done have fulfilled my function he remembered hactar saying that he had managed to make few things he remembered the sudden movement in his holdall that had made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the dust cloud he remembered that he had travelled back in time couple of days to come to lord again he also remembered that he was nt very good bowler he felt his arm coming round gripping tightly on to the ball which he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that hactar had built himself and planted on him the bomb which would cause the universe to come to an abrupt and premature end he hoped and prayed that there was nt an afterlife then he realized there was contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there was nt an afterlife he would feel very very embarrassed meeting everybody he hoped he hoped he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered it to be because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion he felt his legs pounding he felt his arm coming round he felt his feet connecting with the airline holdall he stupidly left lying on the ground in front of him he felt himself falling heavily forward but having his mind so terribly full of other things at this moment he completely forgot about hitting the ground and did nt still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whimpering with surprise he wheeled and whirled through the air spinning out of control he twisted down towards the ground flinging himself hectically through the air at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance he hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind it still had its multifunctional battleclub raised but had suddenly been deprived of anything to hit with sudden mad access of strength he wrestled the battleclub from the grip of the startled robot executed dazzling banking turn in the air hurtled back down in furious powerdrive and with one crazy swing knocked the robot head from the robots shoulders are you coming now said ford epilogue life the universe and everything and at the end they travelled again there was time when arthur dent would not he said that the bistromathic drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one that mind and universe were one that perception and reality were one and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in one place and that what with one thing and another he would rather just stay put for while and sort it all out in his mind which was now at one with the universe so it should nt take too long and he could get good rest afterwards put in little flying practice and learn to cook which he had always meant to do the can of greek olive oil was now his most prized possession and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him certain sense of the oneness of things which made him feel that he yawned and fell asleep in the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and idyllic planet where they would nt mind him talking like that they suddenly picked up computerdriven distress call and diverted to investigate small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the merida class seemed to be dancing strange little jig through the void brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine its computer was fine but that its pilot was mad halfmad halfmad the man insisted as they carried him raving aboard he was journalist with the siderial daily mentioner they sedated him and sent marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try and talk sense was covering trial he said at last on argabuthon he pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders his eyes stared wildly his white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew in the next room easy easy said ford trillian put soothing hand on his shoulder the man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the ship sick bay the case he said is now immaterial but there was witness witness man called called prak strange and difficult man they were eventually forced to administer drug to make him tell the truth truth drug his eyes rolled helplessly in his head they gave him too much he said in tiny whimper they gave him much too much he started to cry thing the robots must have jogged the surgeon arm robots said zaphod sharply what robots some white robots whispered the man hoarsely broke into the courtroom and stole the judge sceptre the argabuthon sceptre of justice nasty perspex thing do nt know why they wanted it he began to cry again and think they jogged the surgeon arm he shook his head loosely from side to side helplessly sadly his eyes screwed up in pain and when the trial continued he said in weeping whisper they asked prak most unfortunate thing they asked him he paused and shivered to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth only do nt you see he suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them they given him much too much of the drug he collapsed again moaning quietly much too much too much too much too the group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other there were goose pimples on backs what happened said zaphod at last oh he told it all right said the man savagely for all know he still telling it now strange terrible things terrible terrible he screamed they tried to calm him but he struggled to his elbows again terrible things incomprehensible things he shouted things that would drive man mad he stared wildly at them or in my case he said halfmad journalist you mean said arthur quietly that you are used to confronting the truth no said the man with puzzled frown mean that made an excuse and left early he collapsed into coma from which he recovered only once and briefly on that one occasion they discovered from him the following when it became clear that prak could not be stopped that here was truth in its absolute and final form the court was cleared not only cleared it was sealed up with prak still in it steel walls were erected around it and just to be on the safe side barbed wire electric fences crocodile swamps and three major armies were installed so that no one would ever have to hear prak speak that pity said arthur like to hear what he had to say presumably he would know what the ultimate question to the ultimate answer is it always bothered me that we never found out think of number said the computer any number arthur told the computer the telephone number of king cross railway station passenger inquiries on the grounds that it must have some function and this might turn out to be it the computer injected the number into the ship reconstituted improbability drive in relativity matter tells space how to curve and space tells matter how to move the heart of gold told space to get knotted and parked itself neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the argabuthon chamber of law the courtroom was an austere place large dark chamber clearly designed for justice rather than for instance for pleasure you would nt hold dinner party here at least not successful one the decor would get your guests down the ceilings were high vaulted and very dark shadows lurked there with grim determination the panelling for the walls and benches the cladding of the heavy pillars all were carved from the darkest and most severe trees in the fearsome forest of arglebard the massive black podium of justice which dominated the centre of the chamber was monster of gravity if sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the justice complex of argabuthon it would have turned around and slunk straight back out again arthur and trillian were the first in whilst ford and zaphod bravely kept watch on their rear at first it seemed totally dark and deserted their footsteps echoed hollowly round the chamber this seemed curious all the defences were still in position and operative around the outside of the building they had run scan checks therefore they had assumed the truthtelling must still be going on but there was nothing then as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness they spotted dull red glow in corner and behind the glow live shadow they swung torch round on to it prak was lounging on bench smoking listless cigarette hi he said with little halfwave his voice echoed through the chamber he was little man with scraggy hair he sat with his shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept jiggling he took drag of his cigarette they stared at him what going on said trillian nothing said the man and jiggled his shoulders arthur shone his torch full on prak face we thought he said that you were meant to be telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth oh that said prak yeah was finished there not nearly as much of it as people imagine some of it pretty funny though he suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter and stopped again he sat there jiggling his head and knees he dragged on his cigarette with strange halfsmile ford and zaphod came forward out of the shadows tell us about it said ford oh ca nt remember any of it now said prak thought of writing some of it down but first could nt find pencil and then thought why bother there was long silence during which they thought they could feel the universe age little prak stared into the torchlight none of it said arthur at last you can remember none of it no except most of the good bits were about frogs remember that suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet on the ground you would not believe some of the things about frogs he gasped come on let go and find ourselves frog boy will ever see them in new light he leapt to his feet and did tiny little dance then he stopped and took long drag at his cigarette let find frog can laugh at he said simply anyway who are you guys we came to find you said trillian deliberately not keeping the disappointment out of her voice my name is trillian prak jiggled his head ford prefect said ford prefect with shrug prak jiggled his head and said zaphod when he judged that the silence was once again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly am zaphod beeblebrox prak jiggled his head who this guy said prak jiggling his shoulder at arthur who was standing silent for moment lost in disappointed thoughts me said arthur oh my name arthur dent prak eyes popped out of his head no kidding he yelped you are arthur dent the arthur dent he staggered backwards clutching his stomach and convulsed with fresh paroxysms laughter hey just think of meeting you he gasped boy he shouted you are the most wow you just leave the frogs standing he howled and screamed with laughter he fell over backwards on to the bench he hollered and yelled in hysterics he cried with laughter he kicked his legs in the air he beat his chest gradually he subsided panting he looked at them he looked at arthur he fell back again howling with laughter eventually he fell asleep arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried prak comatose on to the ship before we picked up prak said arthur was going to leave still want to and think should do so as soon as possible the others nodded in silence silence which was only slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came drifting from prak cabin at the farthest end of the ship we have questioned him continued arthur or at least you have questioned him as you know ca nt go near him on everything and he does nt really seem to have anything to contribute just the occasional snippet and things do nt want to hear about frogs the others tried not to smirk now am the first to appreciate joke said arthur and then had to wait for the others to stop laughing am the first he stopped again this time he stopped and listened to the silence there actually was silence this time and it had come very suddenly prak was quiet for days they had lived with constant manical laughter ringing round the ship only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling and sleep arthur very soul was clenched with paranoia this was not the silence of sleep buzzer sounded glance at board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by prak he not well said trillian quietly the constant laughing is completely wrecking his body arthur lips twitched but he said nothing we better go and see him said trillian trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face he wants you to go in she said to arthur who was wearing his glum and tightlipped one he thrust his hands deep into his dressinggown pockets and tried to think of something to say which would nt sound petty it seemed terribly unfair but he could nt please said trillian he shrugged and went in taking his glum and tightlipped face with him despite the reaction this always provoked from prak he looked down at his tormentor who was lying quietly on the bed ashen and wasted his breathing was very shallow ford and zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward you wanted to ask me something said prak in thin voice and coughed slightly just the cough made arthur stiffen but it passed and subsided how do you know that he asked prak shrugged weakly cos it true he said simply arthur took the point yes he said at last in rather strained drawl did have question or rather what actually have is an answer wanted to know what the question was prak nodded sympathetically and arthur relaxed little it well it long story he said but the question would like to know is the ultimate question of life the universe and everything all we know is that the answer is fortytwo which is little aggravating prak nodded again fortytwo he said yes that right he paused shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like the shadows of clouds crossing the land afraid he said at last that the question and the answer are mutually exclusive knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other it is impossible that both can ever be known about the same universe he paused again disappointment crept into arthur face and snuggled down into its accustomed place except said prak struggling to sort thought out if it happened it seems that the question and the answer would just cancel each other out and take the universe with them which would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable it is possible that this has already happened he added with weak smile but there is certain amount of uncertainty about it little giggle brushed through him arthur sat down on stool oh well he said with resignation was just hoping there would be some sort of reason do you know said prak the story of the reason arthur said that he did nt and prak said that he knew that he did nt he told it one night he said spaceship appeared in the sky of planet which had never seen one before the planet was dalforsas the ship was this one it appeared as brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the cold hillsides looked up from their steaming nightdrinks and pointed with trembling fingers swearing that they had seen sign sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil princes of the plains in the high turrets of their palaces the princes of the plains looked up and saw the shining star and received it unmistakably as sign from their gods that they must now go and set about the accursed tribesmen of the cold hillsides and between them the dwellers in the forest looked up into the sky and saw the sigh of the new star and saw it with fear and apprehension for though they had never seen anything like it before they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed and they bowed their heads in despair they knew that when the rains came it was sign when the rains departed it was sign when the winds rose it was sign when the winds fell it was sign when in the land there was born at midnight of full moon goat with three heads that was sign when in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all or even just child with retrousse nose that too would often be taken as sign so there was no doubt at all that new star in the sky was sign of particularly spectacular order and each new sign signified the same thing that the princes of the plains and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides were about to beat the hell out of each other again this in itself would nt be so bad except that the princes of the plains and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the forest and it was always the dwellers in the forest who came off worst in these exchanges though as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them and sometimes after some of the worst of these outrages the dwellers in the forest would send messenger to either the leader of the princes of the plains or the leader of the tribesmen of the cold hillsides and demand to know the reason for this intolerable behaviour and the leader whichever one it was would take the messenger aside and explain the reason to him slowly and carefully and with great attention to the considerable detail involved and the terrible thing was it was very good one it was very clear very rational and tough the messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish that he had not realized what tough and complex place the real world was and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it now do you understand the leader would say the messenger would nod dumbly and you see these battles have to take place another dumb nod and why they have to take place in the forest and why it is in everybody best interest the forest dwellers included that they should er in the long run er yes and the messenger did understand the reason and he returned to his people in the forest but as he approached them as he walked through the forest and amongst the trees he found that all he could remember of the reason was how terribly clear the argument had seemed what it actually was he could nt remember at all and this of course was great comfort when next the tribesmen and the princes came hacking and burning their way through the forest killing every forest dweller in their way prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically was the messenger he said after the battles precipitated by the appearance of your ship which were particularly savage many of our people died thought could bring the reason back went and was told it by the leader of the princes but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun that was many years ago and much has happened since then he looked up at arthur and giggled again very gently there is one other thing can remember from the truth drug apart from the frogs and that is god last message to his creation would you like to hear it for moment they did nt know whether to take him seriously strue he said for real mean it his chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath his head lolled slightly was nt very impressed with it when first knew what it was he said but now think back to how impressed was by the prince reason and how soon afterwards could nt recall it at all think it might be lot more helpful would you like to know what it is would you they nodded dumbly bet you would if you re that interested suggest you go and look for it it is written in thirtyfoothigh letters of fire on top of the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet preliumtarn third out from the sun zarss in galactic sector qq7 active gamma it is guarded by the lajestic vantrashell of lob there was long silence following this announcement which was finally broken by arthur sorry it where he said it is written repeated prak in thirtyfoothigh letters of fire on top of the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet preliumtarn third out from the sorry said arthur again which mountains the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet which land was that did nt quite catch it sevorbeupstry on the planet sevorbewhat oh for heaven sake said prak and died testily in the following days arthur thought little about this message but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it and insisted on following his original plan of finding nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead quiet retired life having saved the universe twice in one day he thought that he could take things little easier from now on they dropped him off on the planet krikkit which was now once again an idyllic pastoral world even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves he spent lot of time flying he learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversation was fantastically boring it was all to do with wind speed wing spans powertoweight ratios and fair bit about berries unfortunately he discovered once you have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole time just inane bird chatter there is no getting away from it for that reason arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the ground and love it despite lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as well one day he was walking through the fields humming ravishing tune he heard recently when silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him hatchway opened ramp extended and tall greygreen alien marched out and approached him arthur phili it said then glanced sharply at him and down at his clipboard he frowned he looked up at him again ve done you before have nt he said
