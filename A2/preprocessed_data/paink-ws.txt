william slattery 766303416 painkiller nurse laurie schroeder hand rose in small jerks as if it were surprising itself each movement bringing the middle knuckle of her mid dle finger inexorably closer to the tip of her nose you ve had that knuckle all of your life said soothing pleasant seemingly neverending voice beside her but ll bet youve never really taken the time to study that knuckle and that is your job your only job the only thing want you to do as you look at that knuckle you ll see lines that meet lines that intersect lines that dead end even after you think you ve seen all there is to see about that knuckle every once in while you ll see something new it may be difference in color between the knuckle and the rest of the finger it might be difference in texture and each time you see something different your hand will become lighter the hand will rise more and more into the air and the knuckle will come closer and closer to your nose nurse the shout and the howl of anguish following it jolted laurie schroeder upright it also caused hartley mcvey painful spasm at the site of his incision sorry she said to hartley he gingerly swung his legs and feet back into his hospital bed and waved away her apology you re terrific subject laurie he said no harm done and do nt worry about thing ll certainly be here for while well have another chance maybe later after you take care of mr harris right she said and twisted her upper lip into face that spoke volumes three times hartley had tried to hypnotize her and all three times abbott harris two rooms away had broken the spell it was not matter of bad timing any time would have been bad simply because abbott harris never seemed to shut up ll be back when you get your tens unit anyway nurse schroeder said as she left he almost forgotten the tens unit if it worked blocking pain signals going to his brain with little measured jolts of its own electricity he might be able to reduce his use of pain medication hartley looked forward to trying it even if it did nt work it was gadget and hartley loved gadgets oh my god for the love of god please nurse attila the hun would have melted hartley thought he looked over at willie in the next bed finally he was asleep or seemed to be and hartley breathed as deeply as his staples allowed he liked willie but willie could be tiring literally tiring straight out of dannon yogurt commercial willie was 93yearold georgian who could pace for hours while in barely decipherable english relive his middleage world war ii exploits behind german lines and then suddenly and limberly drop into near lotus position while he explained the phi losophy behind execution hartley was awed by the old man and unabashed ly envious willie was in for tuneup as he put it to put his 63 yearold son mind to rest by proving he did nt have anything wrong with him hartley had just had his gallbladder and chunk of intestine removed what was so annoying was willie inability to understand how anything could go wrong in only 45 years he had 122yearold uncle he said and hartley believed him he also said his uncle still had his gallbladder and hartley believed that too oh god nurse oh please harris plaintively wailed his plea penetrating the entire east wing as usual several visitors had left the rooms of those they come to visit and begun to file by hartleys door to gather outside harris room they were the unititiated those who on an earlier occasion raced to see if they could help the poor man so obviously being mistreated by the staff no longer bothered god the outcry muted abruptly nurse schroeder had arrived hartley looked at his watch it was nt time for harris pain shot yet so hartley figured he either wanted his pillow fluffed or had run out of ice water he noisy willie observed still lying on his side his eyes closed hartley wondered if willie really had been asleep at all or if he ever slept he is that willie doubt mr belski ever in his life thought he be lucky to be in coma belski was harris rommate theirs was one of the more perfect matches made in angel of mercy administration mr harris is lonely willie said are nt we all no willie said he accepted hartley statement as ques tion most have somebody even an enemy he has no time to make friends so he makes enemies easier maybe if get to be your age ll be as smart as you hartley said meaning it you wo nt get to be my age spasm raced through hartley abdomen willie of course was right hartley thought but he asked anyway why not because you keep saying maybe willie answered and his eyes still closed grinned exaggeratedly tell people things like that willie make my living telling people things like that it does nt mean have to believe them people pay you to put them to sleep yes well that part of it also sell them crystals to help them meditate and tap into their higher levels of selfawareness all very scientific willie emitted high nonagenarian giggle you think you re pretty good crook huh thief not thief willie resent that there are many more forces at work around us than you can measure with yardsticks and clocks at your age you should know that at my age do know that well then even if the sciences of cards and crystals and medita tion are still little crude we only entered the age of aquarius in 1975 that does nt mean people ca nt benefit from them my clients find peace of mind that not crooked and not thief do you believe in willie just waved his right hand in circles what believe or do nt does nt matter if they think rock will solve their problems and their problems are solved who cares about the rock you are right total right willie said that your problem now what the hell does that mean it means that you are right you have troubles with english you are right to be at peace is wonderful thing the only big thing to make people be at peace is very good very honorable the rocks and the words they do nt matter you are right but you do nt believe you are right you really believe you are thief hartley sighed it was nt time for shot or pill or even meal anything that would break up the day and save him from listening to willie which became increasingly taxing as days passed especially when willie was right or even stood chance of being right hartley had what he described as flexible past four years as new york city cop followed by eight years as news reporter and preceded by jobs ranging from bus boy to guinea pig for submarine escape suit tests for the navy in antartic temperature water interspersed with year as hypnotist flexible might not be the right word but it suited him not specialist in anything and having simply seen and done too much hartley had carried if you ca nt beat em join em step further to joining them and being able to laugh at them sometimes the laughter was little forced but for the most part hartley was satisfied with his life in the relative lull the only sounds those of sqeaky iv poles and the occasionally murmuring intercom hartley reflected on his past and wondered is flexible might not simply be flippant there had been time he really believed he could make difference in the world hed even campaigned for eugene mccarthy gradually though the mileage had built up on hartley husbands beating wives who gladly stab the cop who tried to stop it loonies proudly taking credit for blowing up strangers streams of dead kids or dead cabbies interspersed with jewelers robbing themselves for the insurance one very tired very rainy night on the curving driveway of the jacob javits convention center as he stared into the trunk of an abandon ed car trying to figure out how many people were entangled in the bloody mess inside he realized the whole damned world was orchestrated that all these things were factored into the mechanism and that as cop he was no more than one extra moving part three he figured definitely six hands and only three with watches it was an epiphany for hartley he was not meant to fix things to make them right he was meant to do exactly what he was doing because part of the grand scheme called for three dead people with six hands and three watches to be in car trunk and another part of the plan said there had to be somebody around to count them he was not meant to fix things because they were nt broken and in world where everything is as it should be what can you do to bitch about it you write about it the newspapers and broadcast media did nt hold much interest for hartley without having to try them he knew working for them would amount to no more than changing his place in the mechanism but he had good contacts throughout the media so with downtown buddy assuring he got coveted new york city police press card he set up mcvey fea tures he freelanced for everybody took assignments from anybody and in violation of contemporary wisdom of the new york journalism scene prospered within two years he hired few nyu students to monitor the po lice radios and when frank adderly had gotten tired of taking corpse pictures for forensic and decided to join hartley mcvey features ex panded its services to providing art by his fourth year he was success ful enough to make the news and broadcast unions officially edgy which he did nt want to do mostly because lot of those people were personal friends so he backed off hung around the united nations wrote some samples and pretty soon was stringing for englishlanguage papers from dublin to tel aviv then one night he and frank walked into foyer of walkup in chelsea had stood stock still and looked at each other hartley sniffed the air again so did frank dead person he said and frank agreed and so hartley had had another epiphany or perhaps it was just an obvious milepost when you can smell the difference between dead human and dead cat it time to move on hartley had moved on with vengeance if he was destined to be moving part then he would really move if he could nt change the world and by then hartley truthfully was nt sure he wanted to anymore then he was going to do his damndest to enjoy playing games with it and so was born golden grail associates with the help and inspiration of prudish nude dancer named daf fodil and lot of research hartley became the new age wizard of the up per east side he taroted em hypnotized em and crystallized em and they loved it to well into six figures year and that gave him enough cushion to take vacation whenever his clients were too happy with him and he was in danger of taking himself seriously problem he never would face with willie whose 93 years made him too damned shrewd nurse laurie she wants to lose weight right willie more stated than asked bringing him back to his bland beige room his iv tubes his nasogastric tube and the drain that dumped greenish black gunk from his insides to plastic bag dngling from the bed yeah about 20 pounds she ll look terrific and with this knuckle thing you can talk her into losing weight right something like that then your not thief of course not thief told you not thief not even charging her willie cackled sure you charging her your belly hurts you get your medicine quick right you get it quicker than mr harris right everybody charge everybody he said and lapsed into deeper laughter hartley rolled more onto his left side holding his breath to allow his freshly disturbed innards to settle he wished he could take nap he wished the 350aday television had cable he have settled for an orderly with wheel chair cruising in to tell him he had date with ray anything that would break up the monotony of the hospital day and shut up willie an attractive brunnette just then breezed into the room carrying small plastic case in one hand and clipboard in the other mr mcvey she called and hartley raised his hand the brunnette bounced over hartley did nt miss the appreciative look she got from willie im jeannette from physical therapy she said ve got your tens here good ve been looking forward to this you want to avoid drugs people are becoming very responsible about avoiding drugs the shape of her neck made him want to respond to the approval in her voice but he just was nt in the mood for scam not really jeanette just think that choosing to hurt when you do nt have to means your problems are nt limited to your gall bladder ll take medication electrocution or sharp tap behind my left ear if it will get rid of the pain oh her disppointment at least skittered like cirrus cloud across bright sun to be quickly gone you ll find it reduces your drug dependence anyway hartley appreciated the neverending human proclivity for finessing feelings through choice of words how it work it really simple she said opening the plastic case she took out cigarette pack sized box with three knobs and bundle of floppy rubberized discs dangling from wires she plugged the wires other ends into the device the tens send out rapid electical signls we think they blocks pain signals we re not completely sure they may also stimulate the release of endorphins those are the body own pain killing drugs so nature beat scheringplough huh this goes here she went on without responding she dripped sticky goo from tube onto his abdomen and firmly pressed down an elec trode and this one here again some goo with this pad being place on the opposite side of the incision now tell me when you feel some thing she began to turn knobs nothing twist nothing twist yipes whoops sorry that little too much hartley swallowed and nodded agreement the muscle between the electrodes had twitched violently and hurt just how much juice has that thing got oh do nt let it size fool you it can deliver lot bigger shot than that great now want you to turn these knobs this one controls the in tensity and this one sets the width of the pulse changing that gives you the feeling of changing the depth of the sensation play go ahead hartley did and in short time was beginning to enjoy playing with the thing he settled on particularly warm and soothing setting how that feel very pleasant and how the abdominal pain hartley felt his eyes widen the damned thing worked the linger ing pain that even drugs could nt abolish was gone it gone he said jeannette absolutely glowed sometimes you get used to setting so you may have to adjust it once in while otherwise that it hartley thanked her as she left and went back to playing with his new toy only then did he notice that willie had been totally absorbed by the demonstration to the point he not said word this could be very useful thing willie is nothing new the germans once put wires on my balls and cranked up field telephone oh ll bet that really got rid of the pain sure did hurt so damn much passed out felt nothing then it was wilie favorite time of day dinner was beef vegeta ble soup turkey breast and candied sweet potatoes green beans bread butter chilled peach halves hartley liked the hospital food found himself in minority and attributed that to the other patients lack of experience cops and reporters lost their taste buds long before their livers willie absolutely loved the hospital food and told hartley that the cops and reporters should have been in eastern europe in the early 40 willie often reminisced and hartley sometimes became engrossed in the old man stories he was fascinated mostly though with willie reac tions to the horrors he seen and to some he inflicted willie hartley finally concluded had been through flames that scarred the psyche and unlike some men who stop there destined to wear those scars willie had gone on through flames which had scoured him clean again clean but changed massive suffering had given willie rare perspective when you kill man willie had once advised him the advice being unsolicited you must kill quickly and cleanly no matter who he is even if he is butcher who should burn in hell hate does not belong with killing you kill quick and you kill clean not for the man but because death deserves that dignity when willie said it hartley heard death with capital the only times hartley thought he detected tremors in willie monologues were when he talked of food and hunger starvation did nt offer death the dignity it deserved in willie view which gave food place of unparalleled honor in willie pantheon which also made eating beef soup etc in hospital with willie unique experience for hartley he enjoyed willie unabashed delight in every bite of everything and found himself starting to feel the same way for the first time in his life he eaten brussels sprouts they still tasted terrible but somehow that was all right because brussel sprouts are supposed to taste terrible hartley figured another week with willie would forever alter his diet cause him to kill even flies with quick clean swipes of the swatter and probably make his friends consider him even stranger than they already did nurse one two three nurse one two three nurse whatever problem laurie schroeder had handled just minutes before had been supplanted by another the shouting went on and on hartley felt his own stomach contract with frustrating anger harris had in record time alienated every patient and staff member on the floor voices penetrated the walls nurse schroeder obviously had arrived again hartley did not envy her her job some day they re going to poison him to shut him up hartley said fastacting poison he hastened to add silly silly and you policeman too easy to find not if the person who did it is the person who decides what to look for you have good police here hartley they know to look closest at people who make decisions you know this and how would you do it you ca nt ice pick him in his ear in hospital bed either no maybe nurse schroeder came in dinner all right she asked this is lovely willie said beans very good turkey too nurse schroeder looked doubtful and glanced at hartley he means that for canned beans these probably were canned better than any other beans ever and that for dry turkey there is no tastier dry turkey that about right willie very right same for canned peaches it sounds like this is starting to make sense to you too she said to hartley actually it is and ve got to admit ve had some meals in the last few days ve enjoyed as much as any ever ate in the four sea sons your both crazy did nt say they were better laurie by comparison the food was terrible said enjoyed them as much there difference you really have to stay with willie while to get into the swing of it oh sure she said widened her eyes and threw up her hands that just what need the ability to eat anything and enjoy it you re supposed to help me lose weight good point want to give it another try later maybe tomorrow or maybe the next day ll be filling in on the overnight then does harris sleep for at least 20 minutes at time lovely she turned her head toward willie we can send you in then willie and you can give him your lecture on enjoying dry turkey he sure could use it he threw it at me tonight he threw willie seemed to have trouble getting out the word hartley was certain it was the first time he ever seen surprise on willie face well one good thing about dry turkey is it does nt stain she shook her head then she noticed hartley wires you ve got the tens how is working pleasantly surprised why did you figure it like faith healing or crystal mumbo jumbo or something hartley studied her face moment detected no sarcasm she knew he was hypnotist he was thankful now he never told her he also sold crystals well he said it just that the pain gets pretty intense you know and it hard to think this little ninevolt box can tackle it that little ninevolt battery can get boosted to more like 90 volts and if there was more current you be singing with the angels hartley looked down at the tens with new respect and little discomfort this thing dangerous no not used like that just do nt put the electrodes where sudden sharp shock might screw up your vitals like where like forget it and just put them where you re told laurie stretched she had nice breasts hartley thought then immediately dis missed the thought he seen himself in the bathroom mirror that morn ing surgery mandatory washing by hand dirty hair and flourescent lights of precisely the right color to make healthy person look sick made him wonder how any nurse ever fell for any patient hartley willie voice snapped hartley to attention is seven oclock quick excuse me hartley said to laurie as he began fiddling with the hospital aniquated tv remote control there are priorities and jeopardy is having its teen tournament nurse oh oh oh god nurse laurie face clenched her eyes closed then she composed herself and sid time up see you later you going to need your pain shot not if this keeps working at least not right away she nodded and left good woman willie said then shut up alex trabek was introduc ing the quarterfinalists
