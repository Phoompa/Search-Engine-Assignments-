the reality of our situation all of you are being faced with choices many of you are so engrossed with your idea of reality you are not seeing beyond the simplest illusions around you you are not alone as solinus and see this even in areas very close to us in our family unit but what is reality is it something we base life on that may or may not be correct situation but that we use as our basic guidelines in living our lives think it is something closer to our idea of what keeps us safe secure and in sense of well being it is in other words our security blanket what we believe makes our lives work it is the way we choose to see life versus what may or may not be life in true reality all of you have through the years heard about other systems less free countries where people are taught from very early age to accept system of belief that gives little in return infor mation is usually censored and keeps for the most part other systems of living out of the direct knowledge of those who are controled and indoctrinated into group idea these scenarios are based on what few in power wish as to the way things should work my next question when comparing our society to one of cen sorship is how is our system any better than any of these others here is where many will stand up and say it better than all the rest in the world it may be but if it is it would not fluctuate and create suffering in the group following the guidelines of those few in power running this country look at your present situation do you honestly believe it is faltering because times are bad is it possible you have been brainwashed as many if not all peoples of other countries are and that you will refuse to see it until the people that are controlling you decide to change things that directly effect the security blanket you base life on reality dear ones is truth that in its context can not be changed when it is altered in ways that create thoughts of well being it still remains the same the alteration becoming the lived illusion society that gains power by fellowship based on any altered truths creating feeling of well being may give sense of security and well being until the real worth becomes self evident then change by those who are following the illu sion either crumbles or new altered truth sets foundation for yet another crash of its real worth down the line in reality the real truth gets put aside for yet another created illusion each time this happens it opens new awareness in few which undermines the real worth of being followers of those creating this illusion the opportunity comes in these times to release few from the bigger group not seeing and willing to go on to yet another false start creating yet another duration of pain and suffering down the line this is the cross roads all now face this is your chance to stand up as sovereign beings dependent on yourself and your creator for your existence in these times of upheaval many of you will cower and ask for the old to carry you into their ideas and projections of the new some will say no there now is another way and see thus finding truth versus getting sucked into another round of deceit by following someone else in their projected idea of how the group will survive the times ahead the truth dear ones is that you are sovereign beings never meant to follow anyone or thing but the god within that is the simplicity of truth versus the diversity burying it that you base life on while living it on earth you re going to say just plac ing myself in the unknown will not create what need you re wrong and this type thinking will create your next experience of pain and suffering some of you are now saying what in the heck is this guy saying saying there is link to god in you which many of you fail to hear when it speaks to you because you re listening to false gods telling you an altered aspect of this truth this statement is not based on any religious aspect or dogmatic ideal but stands on its own worth because it is true follow this voice and your whole life will change in the best or worst times to the absolute reality of your reason for being created this will give you freedom over the dominion you are in and all else here controlling things around you and others that before you believed effected you if your desire is to find truth in your life versus every thing else you previously based life on it is now time to listen to that voice in you all else is illusion freedom is opening to this truth and releasing the illusion all else of worth follows by this simple act peace and love kortron
