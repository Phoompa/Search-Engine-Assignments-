the hunter and the hunted lieutenant brown sat in his command pod kilometer away from the enormous space hulk huge derelict space ship thousands of years old he sat in the dim room hunched over the console watching the marines move down the corridor through the camera mounts dacosta the lieutenant shouted through the comlink move your squads toward sector zed zed alpha the main offensive requires your presence copy that lieutenant moving now replied dacosta dacosta had turned and made quick count to make sure he had all of his marines pestilato take the point everyone else fall in terminator moved in front of dacosta its massive bulk moving smoothly the footsteps rang out throughout the dark corridor pestilato moved up the corridor dacosta right behind him they came upon fourway intersection three corridors were blocked by thick bulkheads the way they came was the only way open not problem pestilato said calmly his chain fist juddered to life and he cut into the bulkhead in seconds there was terminatorsized hole where the bulkhead used to be dacosta watched carefully looking out for genestealers his bioscanner detected an unidentifiable amount of lifeforms about fifty meters away and closing fast dacosta to lieutenant brown lifeforms detected possible genestealers awaiting instructions continue in present direction any resistance should be met with deadly force understood replied dacosta pestilato saw the blips on his bioscanner sir lifeforms detected genestealers confirmed keep cool replied crowe do nt get overzealous we have to make it through find defensive position and set on overwatch pestilato raised his storm bolter heavy double barrelled automatic weapon that fired hollowtipped explosivecharged caseless rounds he flipped the switch that set his storm bolter to fire faster than it was designed to pestilato looked up and saw three genestealers closing in on him fast there they were three grotesque creatures the stuff you could only dream about things so horrible that they couldnt possibly be real yet there they stood three huge ominous creatures with large purple heads and gleaming red eyes they stood at least seven feet tall and were hunched over their legs looked similiar to dog with haunches and clawed feet they had four arms two with normal human hands and two with claws that could cut through steel like it was soft butter this nightmare was sheathed in tough carapace shell genestealers confirmed at least three coming in fast said pestilato as he pressed the trigger of his storm bolter shot after shot poured into the alien creating large craters in its shell creating mist of putrid green blood the creature squealed and fell to the ground nicodemus to dacosta we were delayed by surprise genestealer attack no casualties we should be in your area now just then nicodemus stepped in followed by fabian and boubonicus nicodemus wore the aegis suit of terminator librarian warrior with powerful psionics fabian was carrying heavy flamer while boubonicus was wielding lightning claws large gloves with claws surging with energy designed to rip the carapace from genestealer body and get at the soft flesh beneath proceed to designated area replied dacosta pestilato fall back we re following nicodemus unable to comply sir genestealers are waiting just out of my line of sight as soon as aaaaaaarrrrgggghh just then pestilato fell to the ground huge slash in the center of his chest his blood soaked the front of his armour as well as the claws of the genestealer who killed him dacosta heard the steady hiss of air as it escaped from pestilato terminator suit pestilato down shouted dacosta dacosta fired as he moved back to the others the genestealer took about fifteen rounds to the head and countless others hit the stealer body it was dead before it hit the ground dacosta this is brown pull out and move to the designated area the offensive is looking grim dacosta noticed that brown voice was wavering as if he was nervous or excited iglesias reporting in sir have karell here with me dacosta turned to see his old friend behind iglesias was karell man that had the spirit of wild stallion and great fighting ability karell was on assault cannon detail although dangerous that the way karell liked things the other three are behind us they should be here momentarily good because we do nt have much time to wait the genestealers are all around us we have to move aaarrggh dacosta felt great weight slam into him from behind he had enough time to turn around and see genestealer trying to rip him apart he drew his powersword as the stealer attacked the clawed hand was aimed right for his face but dacosta was able to get the sword up in time he returned the blow slashing the top of the stealer head karell positioned himself up against wall ready for any stealers that came his way stargrod here we have arrived awaiting instructions find defensive position we have to fight off this first wave if we are to move any further by now fabian and nicodemus were in long corridor set up back to back formation said nicodemus yes sir nicodemus backed up to fabian and fired his flamer into an intersection that would lead long line of stealers to the captain and the others suppressing fire established good on overwatch all we have to do is wait for the captain and the others as he finished his sentence nicodemus saw several genestealers advancing on his position he fired his storm bolter tearing two of them apart the last one managed to dodge the highexplosive shells it raised its arm to slash nicodemus face off nicodemus was faster channelling psychic energy into his force axe he brought the axe down on the shoulder of the stealer lopping two of the arms off the stealer fell to the ground squealing trying in vain to reach the librarian it soon bled to death allright let move you go first ll cover our advance replied fabian good go said nicodemus nicodemus moved forward as fabian backed up fabian continued to fire his flamer at the same intersection buying the other marines the time they desperately needed to regroup let go move move move shouted dacosta boubonicus you take point boubonicus moved in front of the captain he pulled in front of fabian who had his back to him boubonicus readied himself for the stealers coming down the corridor the first one was on him boubonicus drew back hand and slashed the stealer the lightning claws struck the back of the stealer tearing away the carapace boubonicus used his other hand to stab the stealer in the back the claws pierced the soft flesh killing the stealer instantly two other stealers jumped on boubonicus knocking him to the ground he slashed fiercly with his claws cutting deeply into stealer belly causing blood to splurt out onto boubonicuss armor he backhanded the other stealer knocking it back it charged him again boubonicus lowered his claws ready for the stealer the stealer impaled itself on the claws it swung at boubonicus in last ditch effort to kill him but the weak blow bounced off the armor as boubonicus pulled the claws out of the limp body stealer he had nt seen came out from the darkness he had no time to put up his claws to defend himself the stealer pounced on him and clawed away at his chest and arms tearing the armor to shreds help get it off get it off aaaaaaarrrrggghhh dacosta could nt see what happened to boubonicus but heard his pleas for help over the intercom he heard the rending of metal and flesh and soon the sounds became indistinguishable he then heard the sounds of bolter fire and the squealing of dying stealer keep moving shouted iglesias over the noise of the battle iglesias and his squad moved down the corridor after the captain stranski the last in line felt huge weight on his back that forced him to the ground he heard it clawing away at his armour help me shoot it shoot it ca nt reach it with my power glove heeelllpp mmmeeee those were stranski last words he felt the claws digging into his back the pain was unreal then he heard it clawing at the inside of his armour telling him that it had cut through him then his world turned black karell turned just as the stealer finished ripping stranski apart he thumbed the assault cannon to life the barrels spun at fantastic speed becoming blur bullet after bullet hit the stealer reducing it to fine green mist after destroying it he turned and caught up to his fellow marines karell come with me we re taking different corridor we re gon na cut off those stealers karell said nothing but nodded to iglesias the two seperated from the rest at the intersection fabian had been firing at for so long nicodemus moved into room there were three other exits before he had time to think of which one to use stealers were bearing down on him from the right corridor and the corridor in front of him he fired his storm bolter killing two of them he then backed into corner there would be no relief the others were too far behind the stealers advanced on his position nicodemus pulled the trigger on his storm bolter but no shots were fired the magazine fell out of the bolter and hit the ground the sound could not be heard over the rushing genestealers before nicodemus had time to reload the stealers attacked from both sides nicodemus channeled his psychic energy into his force aze and brought it down on stealer decapitating it he channeled more energy into it and attacked another stealer the stealer managed to dodge out of the way but could not counter the attack nicodemus channeled the last of his psychic energy into final blow and slashed at stealer the stealer dropped oozing blood from huge wound in its side nicodemus saw more stealers coming down at him through the corridors he backed into corridor on his left reloaded his bolter and set it on overwatch he fired at the stealers that were coming at him he shot each one over and over again every stealer he shot died instantly he pressed the trigger until the magazine was empty the stealers kept coming get back yelled fabian into his comlink right before he fired his flamer into the room the stealers were charging at nicodemus through obliterating all of them they burst into flame and fell to the ground they tried in vain to reach nicodemus who was just outside the room that it out of juice gon na have to reload give me minute fabian pulled out the empty container of flamer juice and dropped it on the floor he reached around with his left hand and pulled another one out of compartment on his back he popped it into where the old one was he connected the feed tube to the container and was set stargrod and kinner were trying to catch up to dacosta and the others stargrod turned around to see if there were any stealers behind them stealer jumped on him clawing and biting at his helmet the helmet came off stargrod tried to swat at the stealer with his power glove but to no avail the stealer drew back clawed hand stargrod tried to scream but could not he could only watch in horror as the clawed hand came down upon his face kinner heard crunching and grating sound like metal on metal he then heard squishing sound over and over again stargrod he said as he turned around when he turned around he saw stargrod or at least what he thought was stargrod all he saw was suit of terminator armour lying on the ground he saw bloody pulp where stargrod face should have been beside the carnage kinner saw helmet that looked like it had been cut open by can opener he then saw the stealer hovering over stargrod blood dripping from it mouth and claws the stealer leapt at kinner throwing him to the ground kinner tried to fight it off but his arms were pinned by the great bulk of the stealer the stealer started to chew its way through the helmet kinner could only watch as the saliva of the creature ran down his visor he watched the strong jaws chew up and down he heard the seals on the helmet break the helmet came off and he was then face to face with his killer the stealer opened its jaws dacosta heard blood curdling scream from around the corner stargrod kinner sound off silence stargrod kinner respond where are you silence nicodemus backed into junction between two rooms relax nicodemus this is karell ve got your back covered going up to the exit cover me iglesias said as he moved forward the stealers went after him but he kept moving nicodemus was glad to hear the soothing voice of karell nicodemus reloaded his storm bolter again he heard the assault cannon spin to life and pump shots into the disgusting lifeforms by now they would be dying karell held the trigger down continuing to put shots into the stealers then the bullets stopped coming out of the barrels the ammo counter kept counting but no shots were firing she gon na aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrgggggghhhh the assault cannon jammed and exploded nicodemus turned as karell screamed he saw the cannon explode it was suddenly very hot his armour was melting away nnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nicodemus managed to scream before he died with his cover fire gone iglesias knew he could nt make it he saw blips right before the exit registering on his bioscanner he was then tackled from behind he rolled onto his back to see genestealer on top of him get off me you slimy aaaaaarrrgggh the genestealer had ripped iglesias right arm off iglesias brought up his power glove and crushed the stealer head another stealer leaped onto iglesias slashing him to pieces fabian and dacosta moved into the room where karell exploded they saw fragments of karell armor as well as nicodemus burnt and mangled force axe fabian close up back to back formation if they want to kill us they re going to have to work for it yes sir fabian saw genestealers pouring into the room he fired his flamer out of six genestealers five burned to the ground the last one got through the flames to fabian though it was burning the stealer ignored it and attacked fabian raised his power glove but not in time the stealer slashed through his chest nearly cutting him in half fabian only gurgled before he fell to the ground dacosta did nt hear fabian die over the sounds of his storm bolter and the dying genestealers dacosta heard lieutenant brown voice over the comlink turn around turn around dacosta turned around to see fabian lying on the ground bleeding all over the floor fabian helmet had fallen off during the attack fabian empty eyes looked at dacosta with look of despair and pain he also saw the stealer that killed him die you filthy scum dacosta drew his power sword just as the stealer swung at him dacosta could nt get his sword up in time to block the blow the blow ripped through the armour and into his chest he felt part of his arm ripped away he saw his right hand and storm bolter get tossed away he felt the bile rise in his throat the stealer struck him again this time square in the chest the claws dug into the armour piercing dacosta chest dacosta opened his mouth and felt blood drip from his mouth onto the floor he fell to his knees dropping the sword the stealer swung once more cutting through the armour easily and cutting into dacosta side he rolled on his left side the genestealer then slashed deep into dacosta face lieutenant brown saw the screen that was linked to dacostas camera mount go dark like the other nine they are all gone we will always remember sergeant lazarus the reinforcements were unable to reach you fall back and regroup
