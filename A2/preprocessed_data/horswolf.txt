the horse and the wolf once upon time horse was gazing peacefully in rolling green meadow famished wolf passing by saw the horse and his mouth began to water that fine horse and will taste good too he make juicy steak pity he so big do nt think manage to bring him down though you never know the wolf approached the horse which continued to eat the grass maybe if take him by surprise now quite close the wolf spoke to the horse trying to sound as pleasant as he could good day mr horse see you re enjoying meal is the grass good must say you re looking rather pale are nt you well his mouth fool of grass the horse replied pale oh no that my natural colour was born white and grey the wolf pretended not to understand what the horse had said yes indeed very pale it just as well your master has given you holiday in the field instead of working holiday in the field but the picture of health the wolf was now circling round the horse trying to find the best point to attack doctor he went on can treat you if you tell me where the pain is sure can cure it take my advice let me examine you the horse who was not usually wary of others became suspicious of the wolf persistent remarks and thought he had better be on his guard the wolf was now very close and carefully biding his time when the horse said in alarm yes now that think of it have sore hind foot it been swollen for ages without moment thought the wolf trotted up to the hoof which the horse had obligingly raised into the air and when he was certain that the wolf had come within range the horse gave mighty kick catching the wolf on the jawbone and sending him flying would like to examine me again the wolf heard the words as he struggled to his feet with spinning head no thanks that enough for one day1 he mumbled limping away with no further thought for horse steaks
