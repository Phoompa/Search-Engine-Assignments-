rpgnet aolcom dec 11993 dwarf diaries bit of history during one of the big fluff battles think it was the fight against emperior there was prismatic dragon floating around it acted like prismatic sphere sometimes throwing people into alternate dimensions logan some kind of dwarf paladin think asked people to keep an eye out for the dwarves who got thrown around here what happened to five of them logan ve got some very lostlooking dwarves here lost is nt exactly the word for them they were flung from battlefield to the room in tlau talantlika where keep my collection of more questionable magic objects one of them gwolin is thief and decided to plunder the room he filled his pockets with collection of very dangerous rings and then climbed on chair to get at large box on high shelf the chairleg broke and the bottles in the box went flying all over the room it happened to be box full of changing powders so all five dwarves look rather odd at the moment gwolin has clusters of clear tentacles where ordinary dwarves keep their arms and hair blundir has immense blue ears and sixfoot long tongue and it good thing he got the puffycheek powder too or he would nt be able to keep it in his mouth oime beard drips sort of healing mead and she burps bats which she does nt like at all kjorn is centaurthing half dwarf half panther kuradnin got the worst of the lot he bevy of thirteen nightingales with his ordinary mind shared between them they re the silliest hoardrobbers ve encountered in many year though among the most effective was amused enough so that did nt kill them just removed the rings from gwolin pockets and had them amuse me from time to time not expecting this world to last much longer glimpse into the mind of the demiurge who seems even more bloodthirsty than am so moving my collections to somewhere safer and do nt feel like moving the dwarves have no reason to be particulary fond of these dwarves dont ordinarily get angry at uninvited guests especially ones who were thrown here by accident do ordinarily get quite angry at ones who try stealing from my collections they look funny but they mostly sit around feeling sorry for themselves had planned to leave them here to die or not with the world oime is good talker even with bat every few sentences and somehow she persuaded me to send them offworld will send them to yest which at least has mountains for them to play in gwolin has helped himself rather liberally from the pile of things had planned to leave behind so going to put an additional curse or two on them all and further give them this prophecy they shall not be relieved of their bodychanging curses until they come before me and amuse me properly leaving them one of the nettalkers so that you can give them advice tell gwolin to stop planning out loud to kill people when they are immeasurably more powerful than he is despite being smaller and they are around the corner in earshot even without dragon hearing to players this is lowlevel fluff the dwarves are level 13 treat them nicely please gwolin diary october 19 oime somehow managed to persuade the dragon to let us go still want to attack it sure we can kill it told oime that id sneak up behind it and stab it with the glowing blue dagger picked up while it was nt looking it got ta be magic dagger just know it sure it could stab it through to the heart and even if did nt there are five of us and we re each lot bigger than it except maybe kuraddy it cant possibly be as dangerous as the prismatic crystal dragon was but oime is coward she afraid that it has more magic than her told him that ive got magic too and not just this dagger but oime and kjorn chickened out so the dragon drew this big circle in the air and told us to walk through and here we are in bluggiville bluggiville is not going to be my favorite city it full of smelly humans and smellier goats and people keep staring at us have to keep my tentacles under my cloak all the time and it hot kjorn is in even worse shape they are making her stay in the barn oh forgot we had to try five inns before we found one that would take us then we had lot of trouble with the money they do nt like gold here they do nt take silver by weight we managed to change all our silver for circenes and there enough for two or three days and these tentacles are really neat cut little slit in my cloak and took fork off the next table without anyone noticing ok so it only fork next time it ll be purse or watch blundir diary hate this tongue kjorn diary gwolin is supreme blockhead and will probably get us killed within the week he walked in to an alchemist shop and offered the alchemist some weird wand that he took from the dragon if the guy could brew him potion to send us back home so of course the alchemist took the wand and played around with some godawful herbs and metals and stuff he mixes and stirs and boils for while chanting some kind of nonsense and finally he comes up with five little bottles of oily green gunk well we go back to the tavern with our gunk and eventually blundir and oime come back in and we re ready to try the stuff oime sniffs it and she is nt so sure about it and she and kuradnin and gwolin argue about it for half an hour and finally gwolin gets really pissed and chugs his bottle as if it were beer and he falls on the floor puking his stupid guts out oime said that it was not for the uninitiated to know what the gunk was which means she doesnt know but it pretty nasty poison gwolin is pretty tough cookie so he still alive he also pretty pissed if he were able to walk he go back and flame the alchemist stop the dumb shit should have realized that anyone in this city would give their teeth for that wand whatever it does and that if he did nt know how to make the potion we wanted he just make us something so nasty we could nt come back and take the wand from him the idiot should have died blundir diary stepped on my tongue twice this morning blundir diary they made me take care of gwolin not having any fun here they got to go out and tell fortunes all day in the bazaar three days in row gwolin diary lo no lout of an alchemist

on two hundred circenes from schamanuzor and four potions and box of mixed magic and set fire to the rest for revenge kjorn gwolin is as stupid as drunk badger worse drunk badger would go hide in hole and sleep it off gwolin was seen by the watch messing with schamanuzor shop and took great pains to make himself recognizable how many armless hairless dwarven strangers are there in town of humans even in the week with fair we had to leave damn quickly when gwolin got home and told us what he did even then we got caught nobody but the innkeeper thinking we were skipping out on our last night

farmer house and try to buy dinner we re talking to the farmer wife mrs procilla bannockbring and her kids are playing by the side of the road suddenly one of them runs up and pulls kjorn tail so of course kjorn kicks the kid with hind leg the kid goes flying into the ditch and lies there screaming her head off well her head doesnt come off but her ear is pretty much gone procilla goes berserk and starts whacking kjorn on the head with rolling pin and the stupid woman just stands there and lets her do it oime runs over and starts dripping on the kid paying no attention to kjorn at all blundir and kuradnin are totally useless finally have to go put dagger to procilla throat to get her to stop pounding kjorn then mr bargo bannockbring and two farmhands come running over and as soon

lunch in chammaty in this little place called the placid cow hobbits really know how to eat had just finished up my third plate of venison sausages when these two human guys in fancy jeweled chainmail came in they sat down and ordered roast pig the placid cow was serving venison sausages with bacon today so of course they didnt have any roast pig dirty humans probably got their tastes in soldiers camp anyway so they got up and started insisting that they were great knight sir norbern of mishtragrand something like that and his squire and of course they thought that being sir norbean of mergraband and his squire meant that mrs cheesemarket should go kill pig and roast it and have it roasted brown and on their plates in thin stone fall mrs cheesemarket said that sir norburp would have to wait three hours for his pig to roast even if she started it now which she was nt about to not with room full of people so busy eating venison sausages and bacon so the squirter of sir norbong of mistergrank pounded the table and rattled his jeweled chainmail and said that great knight would not be insulted and that he would have redress well mrs cheesemarket stomped back into the kitchen and brought me out another plate of sausages and as she walked past them the guy who called himself squile reached out and shook her well he got the sausages in his face he howled and slapped her and she nearly broke his nose with her ladle so the squayre drew short sword with nasty hooked tip and lots of gold wire twined around the handle so there mrs cheesemarket was facing this squirrel person ladle to short sword and sir norbump of mogglebump getting out mace and crossbow and javelin and glaiveguisarme and grenado and an arquebus and trireme and wakizashi and trident and claymore and katana and battleaxe and ballista and and greatsword bigger than mrs cheesemarket was all for one hobbit kjorn jumped up she was standing already so she got there first and broke stool on the squiddle elbow and ran over and stuck my neat blue dagger up under sir norburp of mistygrinch fancy jeweled chainmail skirt he yowled like stuck pig guess it comes from eating so many of them and fell over and wriggled and got his purse and two of the pouches around his belt couple of the hobbits had gotten up by then and took his weapons away guess one of them was chirurgeon or something he started taking off sir norbleat of middlegash armor and sopping up blood with napkins told the chirurgeon were to tie tourniquet but he did nt do it anyway sir norbleed of mixtergland kicked one of the hobbits into the wall for that and broke her skull but the chirurgeon explained what he was doing and plentiflora the scullerymaid bopped sir norbloke of milfterboing on the head with chopping block few times and he quieted down and let the chirurgeon take care of him when the bandages got there made sure that they tied some around his hands and feet too just in case so the hobbits were pretty happy with us mrs cheesemarket gave us big basket of food and the mayor of chammaty got someone to lend us three more donkeys and we re staying in his house tonight got sir norbladder of mibblebubble helm which has lots of gemstones on it and the mayor actually gave me sir norbbley of mobblebabble dagger with the eagles claw on the tip kjorn had decided to keep the squaffle short sword with the nasty hooked tip and lots of gold wire twined around the handle they decided to take sir nibblebutter of mixerbeanie and the squiggle weapons and if they gave them to us we take them away and if sir nimmowbrain of mizzorgizzard and his squaker want them back they ll have to come after us and sir nifflegram of moddergwatch is nt going to be riding very far for good many weeks to come kjorn diary wednesday gwolin is pretty pleased with himself is nt he oime is acting very strange though she kept trying to get me to let go of my bitterness and things like that do nt really know what she means she was saying something about me being upset about my accident with pando so clawed squire guilliame in the stomach after disarmed him and does nt believe me when say that was defending mrs cheesemarket and she tried to give me some herb tea to go to sleep by and when said no she looked as if she wanted to cast spell letter by sir norberg of mishtragrand to his lady wife esmerella sir norberg to his lady

bluethreaded pearls and one of the opabins from sir nirblefart of mobblebladder helm in vernicolo for about six thousand circenes sir neeblebland of mixtlebrobble must be very rich man or he must have been anyways so had lead camel load of money in my pouch and fifty times that in gemstones waiting to be sold this meant that it was time for party so this morning when we were on the road promised that we would eat dinner in the best restaurant in the town that we stopped for the night well did nt need to have sold those pearls and opabins to treat everyone at the best restaurant in hogglesonermwasket the whole evening only cost about thirty circenes plus another dozen or so for extras but getting ahead of myself we passed through harriford on the way there bit after noon and would have been happy to treat everyone to dinner of roast wild frobudgeon but kjorn and oime wanted to keep going so that left us in hogglesonermwasket we asked around and it turns out that the best place to eat is this tavern called the wise panda and it run by butter goblins well we were all pretty leery about going to place run by goblins but this was bunch of hobbits telling us to eat there so we decided to try it the place was packed with hobbits so we knew they were nt fooling and we had to wait half an hour before we got table when we did it was great table though we were right under the oak tree and we could see the newtflashers off to the right and watch the sun go down over the ermwasket to the left and kuradnin could perch in the branches and they even brought out some baskets of seeds for him the wise panda is one of these family style places everyone sits at round tables and they bring out huge plates of food and put them in the middle of the table and everyone dives for them and thirty seconds later the food is all gone and they bring out another huge plate we were sharing our table with two priests of ameniodrarius tailor and his family who came there because his wife maureen had cold and did nt want to cook and he had just sold three embroidered gowns to the mayor and an owldragon named hyrex hermocules taking up three chairs and the waitress was this cute little butter goblin named rosie short for rosamundi with long dark hair and eyes almost as big as hyrex the first course was eels boiled in wine with asparagus and onions sacerglorio the senior priest took one look at the plate and intoned this dish is turpibus and impudicibusque it must be removed hence at once to the kitchen and proper and dignified food brought henceforth therefrom instanter the junior priest cowered nollie the tailor younger son screamed hate eeeeels hyrex looked sacerglorio straight in the face with his astounding eyes and said you declined that wrong think sacerglorio turned fifteen different colors which have never seen on human before including three that have never seen before at all and sat down like man falling into bottomless hole helped myself to sacerglorio eels and gave blundir nollie share the junior priestess sat very still in her seat but kept looking over at sacerglorio and wondering if he was too stunned to notice her eating an eel sacerglorio was man of sterncut cloth and it was nt long before he was only five or six colors and standing up and intoning sonorous phrases again fools that you are he declaimed to eat of this the very food of temptation beware beware lest you find yourself driven to lecherous sin rosie the butter goblin was standing right behind him stabbing the air with her finger whenever he stabbed it with his maureen squeezed her husbands hand the tailor teenage daughter smirked nollie whined daadee whats lecherous sin his older brother whispered it kind of zombie that eats babies up at night so watch out the tailor stooped over and whispered something sternsounding to both of them there was loud squack from the kitchen as some large bird was driven one step closer to being the main course and one step further away from lecherous sin blundir looked at sacerglorio and asked ve eaten lots of eels in wine but ve almost never been driven anywhere they always make me walk sacerglorio was ready to say something pontifical but then blundir licked the wine sauce off of his lips and sacerglorio turned another two or three colors and squeaked everyone turned to look at blundir so stole sacerglorio golden ankh hyrex forgot himself and stared just like everyone else and poor blundir had no choice but to stick his tongue out across the table and gaze into the owldragon amazing eyes with helpless expression on his face all the tailor children howled something at once and most of the rest of the children in the tavern did too kjorn slammed her stein down on the table and shouted stop it let him alone at hyrex knew she was crazy enough to tackle an owl dragon in the middle of restaurant alone so slipped over and got out my blue crystal dagger rosie came over and put hand on what she must of thought was my hand to stop me as hyrex apologized and let blundir go blundir only turned one color but turned it bright enough to light up the whole tavern rosie did nt mind the tentacles sacerglorio could nt think of anything much to say to this so he sat down and scowled at bun the junior priestess ate hers with butter and kept stealing glances at the eels the tailor older son picked up small eel tilted his head back and tried to swallow it whole fortunately kjorn was close enough to keep him from choking on it minute later nollie did it successfully with stalk of asparagus blundir sat there hiding his head behind napkin but kjorn whispered to him until he took it off and stared at his plate nibbling on onions after few more minutes the eels were gone except for the ones on blundirs and nollie plates maureen had made nollie take one eel rosie and another goblin brought us an immense tray with three roast swans on it she took out knife bigger than herself from pocket and started whisking it on sharpening steel hyrex said pray do not trouble yourself cutting mine and stared at the largest swan until it got up out of the pool of carrots and snails and walked across the table to lie down in his plate sacerglorio howled blasphemy summoning of the undead is the darkest evil and would you then eat of it obscurissimus and tripped over his chair trying to get up the priestess scrambled over to drag him up but he was too wild and pulled her down on top of himself nollie whined mummy whats wrong with the priestie rosie flung down the knife and glared at the tangled priests after moment sacerglorio kicked the priestess off of him bowling down two dentists and rather astounded ostridge at the next table he jumped on the table and kicked hyrex swan hyrex made some polite sounds of disapproval as he caught the swan in one claw red as burning beet sacerglorio started chanting dies nox et omnia descendo minoratus the blue lines dripped from his outstreached hand and started the table melting oime started chanting krezu gargelieoi xe argula ouvela essela and the priestess veni creator spiritus rosie whacked at sacerglorio with the sharpening steel the steel touched the lines though and started melting as well hyrex was too astounded to do anything but take bite of the swan in his left claw the tailor his wife and the older son ran to bluggiville in six seconds the daughter stopped by the door of the tavern nollie jumped up and down and squealed with joy the priestess threw shower of coppercolored shellshaped sparkles at the blue lines and oime called up small green cloud with lots of sharp teeth sacerglorio swung the lines like sword the sparkles scattered across the room some of them landing in people steins and sending up hissing evanescent coppery birds made of winy steam the sword struck the cloud and punctured it and it fell to the table leaking green smoke nollie tried to catch it in napkin kjorn ducked under the lines and shoved sacerglorio forward he took one step too far and his leg went through the melted part of the table rosies steel had melted almost to the hilt she had picked up spoon in her left hand and was trying to pry her fingers off of it grabbed each finger with three tentacles and pulled as hard as could together we got her hand off before she had lost more than one joint of finger hyrex grabbed sacerglorio with his glare the ostridge not really following what was going on but determined to join the fight kicked the priestess in the belly the green smoke landed in the swanplate and desparately tryed to plug its side with carrot oime somehow stopped the table and steel from melting any further kuradnin calmed the ostridge down hyrex squeezed sacerglorio down to half his size somehow sacerglorio managed to cloth himself in rush of fire and bound up the chimney and away rosie did nt let go of my tentacles so put some more of them around her nollie gave up trying to catch the smoke and tried to help it plug the hole blundir hid behind his napkin again sure that somehow the whole thing was his own fault well cleaning it up was nt so hard except that the table was ruined and rosie kept wanting to go chasing sacerglorio and make him unmelt her finger and she was too shocked to want to wait tables any more that evening kjorn argued with her long time and finally she agreed that sacerglorio could probably kill her without any trouble at all did nt really want rosie to be waitress any more that evening either have to take my tentacles off her and so finally invited her to eat with us somewhere else the wise panda was pretty crowded and everyone was staring at us so we left and went to wabbatty for fried fish and apples hyrex came with us do nt know where the other people went the rest of dinner was pretty pleasant except that it was full of surprises first the other waiter from the wise panda came running in and told rosie that she was fired unless she came back at once hit him with fivecircene coin on his left ear rosie laughed and that was that then maureen came and shouted at me for rescuing that butter goblin instead of nollie and giving nollie the green smoky thing with carrot in its side as pet oime finally stood up and talked mysteriously to her of dark secrets and hidden purposes beyond the ken of ordinary hobbits maureen turned pale and left then oime went back to talking mysteriously to the rest of us about dark secrets and hidden purposes beyond the ken of ordinary dwarves and butter goblins and owl dragons and whatnot like usual we ignored her then hyrex looked at me long time until all my colors flowed into my boots and stood there shivering and transparent after while he let me sit down and drink mug of mulled wine rosie rubbed my back asked him why he did it but he only said that he could nt find even tiny seam in the curse and should talk to great wizard to have it removed rosie asked what curse so kjorn and took her by the fire and we told her everything so it been pretty exciting day rosie is going home for the night but she promised to meet us at emilio grand bakery for breakfast at the ruined temple dwarf diaries part an kjorn diary monday after the excitement last night we all slept rather late this morning woke up with haribande singing on my windowsill gwolin of course was up with the sprandils and geese going to his breakfast date with rosie rosie it turns out had gone home and fought furiously for four hours with her roommate eleanor once eleanor had tried to make up but she squeezed rosie hand rosie wounded hand and that set off the fight again finally eleanor went to sleep and rosie went and watched the stars go down for the last time from the village oak so she went to bed about the time that gwolin was getting up eventually this all got sorted out and the six of us had very fine late lunch at emilio grand bakery with thirteen seed buns of different kinds for kuradnin and we bought two dozen loaves and gigantic wolio pie to take with us and we stopped at cornmobble bookshop and bought map of the area no more wondering how far it is to the next town or asking confused peasants because rosie is coming with us at least as far as mistancleagh she has decided that she rather try to find someone to try to heal her finger which hurts considerably and is covered with tiny blue lines than stay here and seek fifth job as waitress with so many of the restaurants in town having fired her already she also seems to want to get away from eleanor her roommate do nt think need to say what gwolin thinks about this ve never seen him gloat so much in my life kjorn diary wednesday blundir and caught brace of frobudgeon with mallets today so we had to stop early to cook them we did nt want to carry them farther than we had to so we looked on the map and found that there was monastary of the order of cameleord in the area we followed the road through the forest which was nt easy it was overgrown and wandered through streams and forked in ways that the map did nt mention after hiking for an hour and carrying one of the frobudgeons on my back as the donkeys would nt stand the blood kuradnin flying overhead saw some very monastic walls in the distance and we scrambled through the brush to get there it turned out to be temple of st lixy windows overgrown with ivy the chapel pool of mud and obviously long abandoned we slogged through muddy halls to the kitchen which was somewhat higher than the rest of the building and fairly clean there was almost enough room in the great fireplace with the figure of lixy carved over it to roast the frobudgeons of course there was nt any wood in the kitchen and the woodheap outdoors was inhabited by large family of glistening red skinks so we sent gwolin into the forest to collect firewood and mushrooms he did nt do it of course instead he brought back three pilgrims two gnomes brogi with bandage on his left leg and hamerio wearing yellow cap and rajik named ponghashtidar they also had map from cornmobble but it did nt look anything like our map and neither of them looked anything like the land we had walked through brogi pony had snatched bite of unwise binderfresh by the side of the road and was suffering from staggers and palpitations gwolin the evergenerous had offered oime skill with herbs for the pony and leg of my frobudgeon for the pilgrims well and he had the right of it oime was more than happy to leave the cooking to rosie and gwolin and take look at the pony the pony goggled back at her bats with terrified eyes the size of saucers and nearly fell into the fire when it saw me went back to the fireplace with the bust of lixy to help rosie who appreciated being rescued from gwolin unsubtle tentacles and took the opportunity to nearly char the rest of her finger off in the fireplace she says that heat makes it feel better two minutes later of course oime came down and sent me into the woods to pick tassle of st odin wort and charnberry which she boiled up and put in some oatmeal and fed it to the pony then she herself went into the forest to gather some more herbs she came back with large basket full of unearthly vegetation most of it still wriggling gently she put three pots of varying sizes on the hearth next to the frobudgeons filled two with water and one with wine and casually and randomly threw her herbs into them three stalky bluegreen things in the big pot then two of the floppy ones with yellow tendrils into the wine then the bushy one with tiny claws into the big pot then the one chanting its deathchant into the small pot and so on talking about magic all the while and not even looking at what she was doing the pilgrims stared at her as if she was crazy finally she was down to six tiny mushrooms which whimpered when she picked them up she stared at them as if she did nt know how they had gotten there and very likely she did nt she shook them little they rattled frowned at them looked very carefully at all three of the pots and finally dropped them in gwolin beer where they fizzled and smoked and finally vanished without trace nobody had the slightest idea what she was doing probably not even oime and everybody stared at her completely baffled even the bust of lixy and nobody could think of anything to say so everybody was quiet when gwolin came back and drank it it did nt calm him down any though if that what she was trying to do and so we sat and waited for the frobudgeon to cook hamerio brought out some expensive tlin imported on the backs of heretics from meridakatu and we sat around the fireplace under the carved head of lixy holding hot steaming aromatic mugs and keeping out the cold and the conversation quickly turned to our troubles and woes it does that lot these days people usually ask oime about her bats giving her chance to say something sonorous and arcane so hamerio politely asked if we were all cursed by sorcery gwolin most sensitive of men said yes everybody but rosie rosie glowered at him my finger is giving me far more pain than your invisible tentacles have ever given you mister thief gwolin sputtered and grovelled for few minutes too and then brogi rescued him explaining how his hand too was injured by sorcery it seems that brogi had sold five charixalatlu feathers on credit to wizard of melidor but had not known that they came from male bird and of course when the wizard went to conjure with them one of them woke up and pierced his left leg all the way through when brogi came to collect his price from the wizard the wizard had paid him in curse instead that each day at dawn something should stab him through in that same place he has to carry sharp clean silver skewer and stab himself lest something worse do it for him hamerio was the most pious of gnomes he had persuaded brogi to go on pilgrimage and find god who would cure him and he was determined to ask at every temple until someone answered and just because this temple was abandoned and ruined was nt going to stop him he knelt in front of the fireplace knocking over oime mug in the process and prayed to lixy great and wonderridden saint look upon us in our plight we beg of you in your boundless mercy and understanding to bring joy and health and happiness to those two among us who are most in despair and pain for the many hurts and harms they have taken and the bust of lixy answered in voice like starlight on still water saying fear not good gnome and shall grant thy prayer when the moon rises everyone stared at the fireplace and none more astonished than hamerio himself rosie clapped her hands as if she was already healed and yelped when she realized she was nt the moon was nt due to rise till well after midnight brogi knelt beside his brother and gave thanks gwolin looked bit disappointed obviously afraid that rosie would go back to hogglesonermwasket dinner was rather feast everyone had hand in it rosie and made very elegant sauce of white wine and garlic for the frobudgeon the pilgrims brought out some very sharp old sorgenfrei cheese which they melted on top of slices of the breast blundir and kuradnin had gathered some almonds and marrownuts on the way and even gwolin had picked up six ripe orange juicy proys which he gave to rosie with his guess at what gallant gesture might look like she did nt look completely pleased by it though but perhaps she was just anxious for moonrise and healing moonrise was still hours off and her finger hurt more than ever with anticipation two of oime potions were for the horse but the one with wine was for us and thoroughly terrifying sauce it was too she said it is an old family recipe but ca nt remember my aunt ever making anything like it and do nt believe that anyone but oime could find any of those herbs ive certainly never seen anything like them none of us would touch it and even the gnomes were nt brave enough to try something that color they said it would clash with their sorgenfrei but oime sat there dipping little pieces of bread and white meat into it and eating them quite happily and finally ponghashtidar decided to try some of it and of course he jumped eight feet off the ground at one taste of it and stayed there until the next morning and neither oime nor rosie nor hamerio could coax him down and moonrise was still hours away so we finished off most of one frobudgeon and almost half of the other as well as all the rest of the food everyone was stuffed and moonrise was still hours away rosie and spent twenty minutes persuading gwolin who had nt done any work yet that day to do the dishes brogi and oime went to try to coax the pony to drinking one of the potions the rest of us listened to its protests and occasional demands for lawyer andor exorcist for while but moonrise was still hours away and so rosie volunteered to help me try to dust off the beds all of the the beds that were still dry were inhabited by large scaly spiders who protested violently when they were disturbed and two of them were homes to some very determined brown toads who threatened to start petitions evicting us from the temple if we so much as slept in the same room as them so we came back to the kitchen where moonrise turned out to still be hours away and blundir was doing the dishes under gwolin supervision nobody particularly wanted to be the one to move the spiders and toads and hamerio quickly remembered that ste lixy was known for kindness to animals as well as people and she would probably be displeased if we disturbed her temples inhabitants and moonrise was still hours away so we decided to all of us sleep in the kitchen this hardly ended the matter as there were nine of us and only space for fourteen or fifteen and moonrise was still hours away but finally we agreed that rosie should sleep on one side of me and gwolin on the other and that oime would promise not to snore in blundir ear and that we should put blanket on the floor in case ponghashtidar came down and moonrise was still hours away finally we finished the last of the negotiations and arranged the bedrolls oime was soon snoring noisily to an audience of ancient pots and pans hanging on the wall and slowlygrowing crowd of bats and her beard in bowl so as not to soak her bed blundir was next to her with plugs of parsley in his ears gwolin to his credit never once tried to sneak tentacle over me and went right to sleep rosie was too excited to sleep even though moonrise was still hours away and kept wriggling whenever dozed off hamerio and brogi were on the great choppingblock sometimes talking in low whispers kuradnin was mostly sleeping on the banisters and ponghashtidar was still in the air and finally moonrise was no longer hours away and everyone but gwolin woke up shimmering figure rushed into the kitchen from the general direction of the chapel bright and ethereal bird perched on each hand she glided around the room once swiftly looking at each of us look like rush of cold water on broiling day then she stood in the middle of the room and pointed and the birds flew where she pointed and there they healed the frobudgeons on the hearth stood up and gave the saint their courtesy but she was gone then they glared once at blundir and twice at me for killing them and three times round again at all of us for eating them and stalked out of the ruined temple as elegant as icicles nobody could think of anything to say but held rosie for an hour while she cried herself to sleep
