earth dreamlands 313 5585024 144 313 5585517 bbs for text file junkies rpgnet gm file archive site the adventure of the three students it was in the year 95 that combination of events into which need not enter caused mr sherlock holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great university towns and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which am about to relate befell us it will be obvious that any details which would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive so painful scan dal may well be allowed to die out with due discretion the incident itself may however be described since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was re markable will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give clue as to the people concerned we were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to library where sherlock holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early english charters researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives here it was that one evening we received visit from an acquaintance mr hilton soames tutor and lec turer at the college of st luke mr soames was tall spare man of nervous and excitable temperament had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred trust mr holmes that you can spare me few hours of your valuable time we have had very painful incident at st luke and really but for the happy chance of your being in town should have been at loss what to do am very busy just now and desire no distractions my friend answered should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police no no my dear sir such course is utterly impossible when once the law is evoked it can not be stayed again and this is just one of those cases where for the credit of the college it is most essential to avoid scandal your discretion is as well known as your powers and you are the one man in the world who can help me beg you mr holmes to do what you can my friend temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man he shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story must explain to you mr holmes that tomorrow is the first day of the examination for the fortescue scholarship am one of the examiners my subject is greek and the first of the papers consists of large passage of greek translation which the candidate has not seen this passage is printed on the examina tion paper and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance for this reason great care is taken to keep the paper secret today about three oclock the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers the exercise consists of half chapter of thucydides had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct at fourthirty my task was not yet completed had however promised to take tea in friend rooms so left the proof upon my desk was absent rather more than an hour you are aware mr holmes that our college doors are double green baize one within and heavy oak one without as approached my outer door was amazed to see key in it for an instant imagined that had left my own there but on feeling in my pocket found that it was all right the only duplicate which existed so far as knew was that which belonged to my servant bannister man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion found that the key was indeed his that he had entered my room to know if wanted tea and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out his visit to my room must have been within very few minutes of my leaving it his forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion but on this one day it has pro duced the most deplorable consequences the moment looked at my table was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers the proof was in three long slips had left them all together now found that one of them was lying on the floor one was on the side table near the window and the third was where had left it holmes stirred for the first time the first page on the floor the second in the window the third where you left it said he exactly mr holmes you amaze me how could you possi bly know that pray continue your very interesting statement for an instant imagined that bannister had taken the unpar donable liberty of examining my papers he denied it however with the utmost earnestness and am convinced that he was speaking the truth the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that was out and had entered to look at the papers large sum of money is at stake for the scholarship is very valuable one and an unscrupulous man might very well run risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows bannister was very much upset by the incident he had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with gave him little brandy and left him collapsed in chair while made most careful examination of the room soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers on the table in the window were several shreds from pencil which had been sharpened broken tip of lead was lying there also evidently the rascal had copied the paper in great hurry had broken his pencil and had been compelled to put fresh point to it excellent said holmes who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case fortune has been your friend this was not all have new writingtable with fine surface of red leather am prepared to swear and so is bannis ter that it was smooth and unstained now found clean cut in it about three inches long not mere scratch but positive cut not only this but on the table found small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like saw dust in it am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity was at my wit end when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town and came straight round to put the matter into your hands do help me mr holmes you see my dilemma either must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared and since this can not be done without explanation there will ensue hideous scandal which will throw cloud not only on the college but on the university above all things desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as can said holmes rising and putting on his overcoat the case is not entirely devoid of interest had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you yes young daulat ras an indian student who lives on the same stair came in to ask me some particulars about the exami nation for which he was entered yes and the papers were on your table to the best of my belief they were rolled up but might be recognized as proofs possibly no one else in your room no did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer did this man bannister know no certainly not no one knew where is bannister now he was very ill poor fellow left him collapsed in the chair was in such hurry to come to you you left your door open locked up the papers first then it amounts to this mr soames that unless the indian student recognized the roll as being proofs the man who tam pered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there so it seems to me holmes gave an enigmatic smile well said he let us go round not one of your cases watson mental not physical all right come if you want to now mr soames at your disposal the sittingroom of our client opened by long low latticed window on to the ancient lichentinted court of the old college gothic arched door led to worn stone staircase on the ground floor was the tutor room above were three students one on each story it was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room he must have entered through the door there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide dear me said holmes and he smiled in singular way as he glanced at our companion well if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room we stood at the entrance while holmes made an examina tion of the carpet am afraid there are no signs here said he one could hardly hope for any upon so dry day your servant seems to have quite recovered you left him in chair you say which chair by the window there see near this little table you can come in now have finished with the carpet let us take the little table first of course what has happened is very clear the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table he carried them over to the window table because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard and so could effect an escape as matter of fact he could not said soames for entered by the side door ah that good well anyhow that was in his mind let me see the three strips no finger impressions no well he carried over this one first and he copied it how long wouid it take him to do that using every possible contraction quarter of an hour not less then he tossed it down and seized the next he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there you were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door no ca nt say was well he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil and had as you observe to sharpen it again this is of interest watson the pencil was not an ordinary one it was above the usual size with soft lead the outer colour was dark blue the maker name was printed in silver lettering and the piece remaining is only about an inch and half long look for such pencil mr soames and you have got your man when add that he possesses large and very blunt knife you have an additional aid mr soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information can follow the other points said he but really in this matter of the length holmes held out small chip with the letters nn and space of clear wood after them you see no fear that even now watson have always done you an injustice there are others what could this nn be it is at the end of word you are aware that johann faber is the most common maker name is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the johann he held the small table sideways to the electric light was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no see nothing do nt think there is any thing more to be learned here now for the central table this small pellet is presume the black doughy mass you spoke of roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out perceive as you say there appear to be grains of sawdust in it dear me this is very interesting and the cut positive tear see it began with thin scratch and ended in jagged hole am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case mr soames where does that door lead to to my bedroom have you been in it since your adventure no came straight away for you should like to have glance round what charming oldfashioned room perhaps you will kindly wait minute until have examined the floor no see nothing what about this curtain you hang your clothes behind it if anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow no one there suppose as holmes drew the curtain was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency as matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from line of pegs holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa what this said he it was small pyramid of black puttylike stuff exactly like the one upon the table of the study holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sittingroom mr soames what could he have wanted there think it is clear enough you came back by an unexpected way and so he had no warning until you were at the very door what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself good gracious mr holmes do you mean to tell me that all the time was talking to bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it so read it surely there is another alternative mr holmes dont know whether you observed my bedroom window latticepaned lead framework three separate windows one swinging on hinge and large enough to admit man exactly and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible the man might have effected his entrance there left traces as he passed through the bedroom and finally finding the door open have escaped that way holmes shook his head impatiently let us be practical said he understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are and they are all in for this examination yes have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others soames hesitated it is very delicate question said he one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs let us hear the suspicions will look after the proofs will tell you then in few words the character of the three mcn who inhabit these rooms the lower of the three is gilchrist fine scholar and athletc plays in the rugby team and the cricket team for the college and got his blue for the hurdles and the long jump he is fine manly fellow his father was the notorious sir jabez gilchrist who ruined himself on the turf my scholar has been left very poor but he is hardworking and industrious he will do well the second floor is inhabited by daulat ras the indian he is quiet inscrutable fellow as most of those indians are he is well up in his work though his greek is his weak subject he is steady and methodical the top floor belongs to miles mclaren he is brilliant fellow when he chooses to work one of the brightest intellects of the university but he is wayward dissipated and unprinci pled he was nearly expelled over card scandal in his first year he has been idling all this term and he must look forward with dread to the examination then it is he whom you suspect dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely exactly now mr soames let us have look at your servant bannister he was little whitefaced cleanshaven grizzlyhaired fel low of fifty he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life his plump face was twitching with his nervousness and his fingers could not keep still we are investigating this unhappy business bannister said his master yes sir understand said holmes that you left your key in the door yes sir was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside it was most unfortunate sir but have occasionally done the same thing at other times when did you enter the room it was about halfpast four that is mr soames tea time how long did you stay when saw that he was absent withdrew at once did you look at these papers on the table no sir certainly not how came you to leave the key in the door had the teatray in my hand thought would come back for the key then forgot has the outer door spring lock no sir then it was open all the time yes sir anyone in the room could get out yes sir when mr soames returned and called for you you were very much disturbed yes sir such thing has never happened during the many years that have been here nearly fainted sir so understand where were you when you began to feel bad where was sir why here near the door that is singular because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner why did you pass these other chairs do nt know sir it did nt matter to me where sat really do nt think he knew much about it mr holmes he was looking very bad quite ghastly you stayed here when your master left only for minute or so then locked the door and went to my room whom do you suspect oh would not venture to say sir do nt believe there is any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an action no sir ll not believe it thank you that will do said holmes oh one more word you have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss no sir not word you have nt seen any of them no sir very good now mr soames we will take walk in the quadrangle if you please three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom your three birds are all in their nests said holmes looking up halloa what that one of them seems restless enough it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind he was pacing swiftly up and down his room should like to have peep at each of them said holmes is it possible no difficulty in the world soames answered this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them come along and will personally conduct you no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrists door tall flaxenhaired slim young fellow opened it and made us welcome when he understood our errand there were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook broke his pencil had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed knife to sharpen his own the same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the indian silent little hooknosed fellow who eyed us askance and was obviously glad when holmes architectural studies had come to an end could not see that in either case holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching only at the third did our visit prove abortive the outer door would not open to our knock andnothing more substantial than torrent of bad language came from behind it do nt care who you are you can go to blazes roared the angry voice to morrow the exam and wo nt be drawn by anyone rude fellow said our guide flushing with anger as we withdrew down the stair of course he did not realize that it was who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious holmes response was curious one can you tell me his exact height he asked really mr holmes can not undertake to say he is taller than the indian not so tall as gilchrist suppose five foot six would be about it that is very important said holmes and now mr soames wish you goodnight our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay good gracious mr holmes you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion you do nt seem to realize the position tomorrow is the examination must take some definite action tonight can not allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced you must leave it as it is shall drop round early tomorrow morning and chat the matter over it is possible that may be in position then to indicate some course of action meanwhile you change nothing nothing at all very good mr holmes you can be perfectly easy in your mind we shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings goodbye when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows the indian still paced his room the others were invisible well watson what do you think of it holmes asked as we came out into the main street quite little parlour game sort of threecard trick is it not there are your three men it must be one of them you take your choice which is yours the foulmouthed fellow at the top he is the one with the worst record and yet that indian was sly fellow also why should he be pacing his room all the time there is nothing in that many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart he looked at us in queer way so would you if flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day and every moment was of value no see nothing in that pencils too and knives all was satisfactory but that fellow does puzzle me who why bannister the servant what his game in the matter he impressed me as being perfectly honest man so he did me that the puzzling part why should perfectly honest man well well here large stationer we shall begin our researches here there were only four stationers of any consequences in the town and at each holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for duplicate all were agreed that one could be ordered but that it was not usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in halfhumorous resignation no good my dear watson this the best and only final clue has run to nothing but indeed have little doubt that we can build up sufficient case without it by jove my dear fellow it is nearly nine and the landlady babbled of green peas at seventhirty what with your eternal tobacco watson and your irregularity at meals expect that you will get notice to quit and that shall share your downfall not however before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor the careless servant and the three enterprising students holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day though he sat lost in thought for long time after our belated dinner at eight in the morning he came into my room just as finished my toilet well watson said he it is time we went down to st luke can you do without breakfast certainly soames will be in dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive have you anything positive to tell him think so you have formed conclusion yes my dear watson have solved the mystery but what fresh evidence could you have got aha it is not for nothing that have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six have put in two hours hard work and covered at least five miles with something to show for it look at that he held out his hand on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay why holmes you had only two yesterday and one more this morning it is fair argument that wherever no came from is also the source of nos and eh watson well come along and put friend soames out of his pain the unfortunate tutor was certainly in state of pitiable agita tion when we found him in his chambers in few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come feared that you had given it up in despair what am to do shall the examination proceed yes let it proceed by all means but this rascal he shall not compete you know him think so if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into small private courtmartial you there if you please soames watson you here ll take the armchair in the middle think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into guilty breast kindly ring the bell bannister entered and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance you will kindly close the door said holmes now bannister will you please tell us the truth about yesterdays incident the man turned white to the roots of his hair have told you everything sir nothing to add nothing at all sir well then must make some suggestions to you when you sat down on that chair yesterday did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room bannister face was ghastly no sir certainly not it is only suggestion said holmes suavely frankly admit that am unable to prove it but it seems probable enough since the moment that mr soames back was turned you released the man who was hiding in that bedroom bannister licked his dry lips there was no man sir ah that pity bannister up to now you may have spoken the truth but now know that you have lied the man face set in sullen defiance there was no man sir come come bannister no sir there was no one in that case you can give us no further information would you please remain in the room stand over there near the bed room door now soames am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young gilchrist and to ask him to step down into yours an instant later the tutor returned bringing with him the student he was fine figure of man tall lithe and agile with springy step and pleasant open face his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner just close the door said holmes now mr gilchrist we are all quite alone here and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us we can be perfectly frank with each other we want to know mr gilchrist how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday the unfortunate young man staggered back and cast look full of horror and reproach at bannister no no mr gilchrist sir never said word never one word cried the servant no but you have now said holmes now sir you must see that after bannister words your position is hopeless and that your only chance lies in frank confession for moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features the next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table and burying his face in his hands he had burst into storm of passionate sobbing come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being callous criminal perhaps it would be easier for you if were to tell mr soames what occurred and you can check me where am wrong shall do so well well do nt trouble to answer listen and see that do you no injustice from the moment mr soames that you said to me that no one not even bannister could have told that the papers were in your room the case began to take definite shape in my mind the printer one could of course dismiss he could examine the papers in his own office the indian also thought nothing of if the proofs were in roll he could not possibly know what they were on the other hand it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that man should dare to enter the room and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table dismissed that the man who entered knew that the papers were there how did he know when approached your room examined the window you amused me by supposing that was contemplating the possibility of someone having in broad daylight under the eyes of all these opposite rooms forced himself through it such an idea was absurd was measuring how tall man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table am six feet high and could do it with an effort no one less than that would have chance already you see had reason to think that if one of your three students was man of unusual height he was the most worth watching of the three entered and took you into my confidencc as to the suggestions of the side table of the centre table could make nothing until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was longdistance jumper then the whole thing came to me in an instant and only needed certain corroborative proofs which speedily obtained what happened was this this young fellow had employed his afternoon at the athletic grounds where he had been practis ing the jump he returned carrying his jumpingshoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes as he passed your window he saw by means of his great height these proofs upon your table and conjectured what they were no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs it was not dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask question well when he saw that they were indeed the proofs it was then that he yielded to temptation he put his shoes on the table what was it you put on that chair near the window gloves said the young man holmes looked triumphantly at bannister he put his gloves on the chair and he took the proofs sheet by sheet to copy them he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him as we know he came back by the side gate suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape he forgot his gloves but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door that in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction and that the culprit had taken refuge there the earth round the spike had been left on the table and second sample was loosened and fell in the bed room may add that walked out to the athletic grounds this morning saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping pit and carried away specimen of it together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping have told the truth mr gilchrist the student had drawn himself erect yes sir it is true said he good heavens have you nothing to add cried soames yes sir have but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me have letter here mr soames which wrote to you early this morning in the middle of restless night it was before knew that my sin had found me out here it is sir you will see that have said have determined not to go in for the examination have been offered commission in the rhodesian police and am going out to south africa at once am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage said soames but why did you change your purpose gilchrist pointed to bannister there is the man who set me in the right path said he come now bannister said holmes it will be clear to you from what have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out as to his escaping by that window it was incredible can you not clear up the last point in this mystery and tell us the reasons for your action it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know time was sir when was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist this young gentleman father when he was ruined came to the college as servant but never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world watched his son all could for the sake of the old days well sir when came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given the very first thing saw was mr gilchrist tan gloves alying in that chair knew those gloves well and understood their message if mr soames saw them the game was up flopped down into that chair and nothing would budge me until mr soames went for you then out came my poor young master whom had dandled on my knee and confessed it all to me was nt it natural sir that should save him and was nt it natural also that should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done and make him understand that he could not profit by such deed could you blame me sir no indeed said holmes heartily springing to his feet well soames think we have cleared your little problem up and our breakfast awaits us at home come watson as to you sir trust that bright future awaits you in rhodesia for once you have fallen low let us see in the future how high you can rise
