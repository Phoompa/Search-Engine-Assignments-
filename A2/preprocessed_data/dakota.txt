problem sean jsatt letters from erin tarn 101 pa circa dear loyal readers as was on my way to the western coast stopped in town called lazarus the reason mention this is because most of the locals were dbee had finally come upon town that was ruled by dbee and the local humans totally accepted their rule upon entering the town was greeted by pair of gromeks who escorted me to their king the town was compact it seemed the town was more worried about being functional and defensive capabilities than cleanliness and beautification in fact it looked like the town was under siege everybody saw carried some sort of weapon most people passed gave me nervous glance if any at all and quickened their pace little to get away from me was shocked to see beautiful clean marbled structure in front of me it had gold trimming on everything it was weird sight to see this structure surrounded by sea of filth and trash was not surprised to find out that this was the king palace their king was an impressive specimen would guess him to be very powerful fighter even in his own race the gromek king name was grog grog tried to be gracious and polite host but his rough demeanor kept slipping out the gromek seemed to be concerned about something for they kept asking me weird questions about my loyalty and where have been couldnt help but feel that through all their questioning that felt like coalition prisoner right before they get set on torturing me would nt want to feel that way ever again when told them who was their face seemed to lighten little the king asked me to stay for awhile and document what saw happening in his town even though wanted to go to the western coast my old investigator inside me got the better of me and agreed my visits around town lead me to the conclusion that the gromek view themselves as the savior of earth and that the coalition is trying to destroy the earth an all life on it the gromek are little over confident they feel given enough time they could defeat the coalition sadly feel that the gromek are misguided lot tried to make them understand the vast resources the coalition has and that if the coalition wanted to they could crush this town within blink of an eye they would hear none of it think most citizens realize this and are always looking over their shoulder waiting for the coalition to appear just over the horizon an end their security am told their is another town called bismark about 150 miles west of here and since it is on my way to the coast plan on stopping there can hardly wait for it is said that bismark is beautiful city where humans and dbee get along peacefully too hello again am currently writing this letter in luxurious room suite located in bismark finest hotel thanks to the city council know should nt of accepted this room but hey an old girl needs vacation every now and then the council has given me many guided tours throughout the city in the last week everything see is clean even the garbage is clean have seen many beautiful homes and shops this past week it feels like the town has opened up its heart just for me it feels like one long party ca nt help but get the feeling that something is missing from all this niceties do nt know maybe its me maybe not used to people feeling good about themselves for once ca nt shake this feeling so have decided to sneak out tomorrow morning and go on my own personal tour hello there finally figured out what was missing in this town it was the poor downtrodden people that make city complete every city has got them but it seemed this one did nt as told you two days ago planned to go on my own secret tour and well did what saw shocked me it took me awhile to find it had found the bad part of town this part of town was dirty and unkempt buildings were decaying and crumbling there was litter and refuse scattered on all of the streets and sidewalks it seemed these were the forgotten people an indeed they were when asked the town council about these people they denied their existence here the people lived day to day hoping to find meal in the refuse that littered the streets and if finding food was nt hard enough the people had to worry about gangs that wandered the streets beating and killing people for whatever meager possessions they had my heart goes out to those people also their was another strange thing about this town their was almost no magic whatsoever the one magic shop did manage to find was meager at best it seems the citizens are afraid of magic this could be the weak point in bismark armor for if the coalition ever decided to attack bismark would need all help they could get both bismark and lazarus have rather high technology level for such small towns but they can not compete against the coalitions raw numbers fear that eventually when the coalition gets around to it these dbee sympathizers will be exterminated finally another thing that puzzles me how could these two towns have such high levels of technology bismark has advanced medical treatment along with very good communication network lazarus has advanced weapon technology nothing they did or said suggested that they developed or found this technology when asked bismark council was told they got their weapons from lazarus and the medicine was always here later that day one of the council members approached me remember seeing his face during the meeting but he never said anything he just observed he told me his name was texder worthington and that he was technowizard at last finally somebody that was skilled in the art of magic he made me promise never to tell anybody in bismark what he was or what he was about to say of course agreed to his deal texder told me that both towns are secretly being supplied by man named mccoy mccoy sets up contact in city and deliver his goods to that contact who would then secretly release the goods to the open market the funny thing is that both towns governments are unaware of any of this they are told it was captured goods or found items but in most cases they are told they are goods from neighboring town tried to get him to explain more but he would say no more ca nt help but get the feeling that he knows more than he is saying would ve investigated for this mccoy person myself but had to get to the west coast before winter two things puzzle me about north dakota one who is this mccoy and how has he acquired this technology and two there is something strange going on in the badlands have heard too many tales of horror of this place there has to be something there still people enter into the badlands in search of gold never to be seen again while others come out but are in some ways dead already hope to investigate north dakota further on my trip back see you soon erin tarn lands the badlands from all outside appearances the badlands looks the same as it was in prerift time it is still dry and desolate with little or no growth the land was carved out from ancient rivers most people stay away from the badlands their are rumors that clan of faerie folk have taken up residency in the carved out rocks recently new rumor has been spreading across north dakota like fire across dry prairie according to rumor an old miner from prerift days went into the badlands in search of gold after couple of years the man found the mother load unfortunately all he had was mule to carry out the gold so he only carried out small percentage before he could return to get the rest of the gold he died of an illness so to this day people are still trying to find the gold mine at least 1000 expeditions have gone into the badlands searching for gold most of the adventurers have not returned the people that are able to return have distant look in their eyes and walk clumsily like they are not watching where they are going kind of like person who saw something so horrific that they went into shock and still has nt come out yet even though people do nt comeback it has nt stopped people from going into the badlands people are willing to risk their lives just so it might be easier later on in life truth about badlands there are indeed faerie folk living in the badlands they are delighted about all these new visitors they are so much fun to play with there are roughly 30000 faerie folk living in the badlands the rumor about the gold is somewhat false there is indeed gold mine out there somewhere but supernatural intelligence called arpita started the rumors it uses the gold to lure people into the badlands where it captures them an turns them into his minions currently arpita has 10000 minions 90 of his minions are located in the badlands while the rest are scattered throughout north america one famous one is located in lazlo where it sells trips into the badlands right now arpita is working in secrecy it will not try to do anything that might reveal itself to the outside world especially the coalition another danger unknown to the rest of the world that is in the badlands is the inuit the inuits are dead indians who were buried on sacred ground and their graves were disturbed they are doomed forever to eternal restlessness never leaving this plane of existence some of the inuits take their revenge on anyone who happens to come by while others try to help travelers avoid the supernatural intelligence the faerie folk and other dangers also their are some inuits who pretend that they are helping but in reality are leading them to the supernatural intelligence also unknown to the outside is group of ghosts who call themselves the seventh cavalry they are lead by general with long wavy blonde hair they roam the badlands forever patrolling keeping out invaders anyone inside the badlands is viewed as invader and fighting any inuit they see the two groups of ghosts are mortal enemies they fight each other on sight the seventh cavalry ride atop of black horse that skin appears to be rotting away the cavalry were tattered blue uniforms with blue duster they carry what looks like prerift rifles and pistols number of faerie folk 70 common faerie 10 brownie bogies nightelves silver bells others carimine forest this forest is mysterious place it is said that gigantic insects run amuck in this place even though these rumors are widespread there is no actual evidence of this the forest is not dangerous in fact it is relatively peaceful the forest is almost totally void of supernatural monsters and dbee the forest is sparsely populated by humans though due to the near impossibility of farming in the forest have kept their numbers down too for some strange reason the trees in the forest are megadamage creatures it is very expensive to cut the trees down and to make them into useful lumber truth about carimine forest the reason why their is an absence of supernatural life in the forest is because of the presence of the xiticix in the town of xaxxle they have successfully managed to drive out most creatures the reasons why the trees are megadamage is unknown some say that millennium tree grows somewhere inside the forest and it has affect its neighboring trees this reason is doubtful though due to the lack of ley lines in the area others say that these trees are nt regular trees but instead are similar trees that originated from similar dimension oak450 md main body branch is pine300 md main body about 10 md spruce280 md main body for all trees if the tree is cut down it loses its megadamage properties and it becomes regular wood sdc river plains this area is the cradle of civilization in north dakota it is here that mccoyville and bismark rose from the ashes to become major players in north dakota the plains are the surrounding area around north dakota major river known simply as the river this area is very fertile due to the seasonal rains and flooding the area is home to 75 of the former states agriculture it is here where you will most often encounter an agriculturist going about doing his business the plains consist of both humanity and dbee north dakota average temperature badlands river plains carimine degrees

city is actually located 50 miles northeast of the original city this city is haven for humans and dbees alike the town is run by group of elected officials called the council which is voted in every years the biggest building in the town is 10 stories high technology level is early 21st century while communication is good inside the town it is virtually impossible to send message to someone outside of town without having to deliver it yourself or use magic the people of bismark work hard to keep their city in good shape vandalizing carries stiff fine with possible two years in prison their main trading partner is lazarus bismark trades medicine foodstuff and raw materials to lazarus in return lazarus gives weapons armor and ammunition these two cities have had trade agreement for the last 10 years bismark specializes in medicine on almost any block you will find some sort of medical treatment area while they can perform cybernetic and bionic surgery they do nt do it often it is frowned upon by the citizens they prefer to remain natural and unaltered if they can help it the citizens are unaware that the reason for their safety is mccoyville located 200 miles north of bismark when traveling through bismark you will find many varieties of shops and restaurants but their are virtually no magic shops located in bismark you will have to look hard and long to find one and when you do find one it will be small with inexpensive trinkets located in bismark is poor section that is kept hidden to most people in it contains almost anything money can buy gangs rule the area with little or no police force to protect the people guardianthis is coalition base put their after an assault on mccoyville while they think that mccoyville has been destroyed if they were ever to find out that it still exists they would send millions of troops into north dakota to annihilate the town once and for all most coalition soldiers view guardian as punishment due to the relative lack of any action compared to other bases indeed their have been no major skirmishes since the battle of mccoyville years ago emperor prosek does have many plans to conquer north dakota he views that it is easier to attack the xiticix from two fronts instead of one but right now other matters currently occupies the military time and men lazarusthis little town is extremely militaristic it can not support itself it must trade with neighboring towns for supplies the gromek are the ruling class of lazarus the other races are subservient to the gromek including humans the reason for this is that with the coalition so close dbees and humans need security so they are willing to be ruled by the gromek so that they will be safe the gromek have plans of attacking the guardian outpost but for now they are still preparing for this unfortunately the gromek underestimate the power of the coalition the guardian outpost could easily crush lazarus if they wanted to but currently their orders tell them to stay put mccoyvilleonce this town was prosperous city with over million inhabitants the city was run by bodyfixer named jim mccoy at the time mccoy was unaware of the evils of the coalition mccoy entered into trade agreement with chitown mccoy gave them medicine an advanced electronic equipment the coalition wanted more and more at lower prices when mccoy tried to break off the trade agreement prosek threatened to attack mccoyville mccoy was forced to keep the trade agreement all was well for awhile but something went wrong somebody tried to kill prosek they wrongly accused mccoy of sponsoring the attack they declared war on mccoy the coalition sent two armored divisions to annihilate mccoyville mccoy and the townspeople fought bravely and were keeping the coalition from taking over the city mccoy knew that the coalition would never give up and that his own supplies were dwindling the citizens slowly retreated to the center of the town where mccoy main factory was the coalition had them pinned down inside the factory soon they would have to surrender victory was theirs the first indication that something was wrong was when huge power laser beam 300ft in diameter shot toward the sky vaporizing anything in its path this action confused the coalitions commander for they could not understand why mccoy did nt aim it at them about 20 minutes later the citizens inside the factory stopped firing the coalition commander ordered the invasion of the factory to commence that is when all hell broke loose the factory exploded taking most of the coalition troops and town with it when reinforcements arrived there were only 20 soldiers left alive and all of them badly injured there were no signs of the citizens anywhere to be found coalition scientists found the area to be bathed in high level radiation and stated that the inhabitants if any left could not possibly survive for very long unknown to the coalition was that for the last 25 years mccoy and his brothers had been building space station on the last day of the attack the station was capable of supporting life it took all the nuclear power they had but they were able to fire the huge super laser into space to clear away path through the debris and satellites using modified behemoths with booster rockets mccoy was able to launch his citizens into space mccoys brother who is shifter was able to open rift that opened into the station which allowed even more people to get to the station when all of the citizens were out of the factory mccoy ignited the salvaged nuclear bombs that mccoy found in an old ruined town called omaha the nuclear blast took out the upper levels of the factory and most of the town what the coalition did nt know was that the majority of the factory was located deep underground it was able to escape the blast relatively unharmed mccoy returned to earth and repaired the damage to the lower levels and reopened the factory this time though it was to be used to finish the space station to this day the only people that live in mccoyville are located deep underground and are only there to work in the factory recently in the last year mccoy began to reassert himself in north dakota he quietly started to sell weapons and equipment to towns and small cities that had enough money mccoy does not plan on relocating back on earth the space station is his permanent home minor cities in north dakota town population minot2000 humans and 200 dbees ft yates4000 humans and 1000 dbees arena3000 dbees 100 humans and 250 gromek new town1000 humans and 600 dbees xaxxle500 xiticix fariton600 humans and 300 dbees descriptions minotthis city survived the rifts relatively intact only to be destroyed by roving band of dbees some former inhabitants decide to stay and rebuild their city minot is farming town they trade their crops for weapons from lazarus minotens are weary of strangers they distrust any dbee and will run them out of town the only dbees in town are slaves who work in the fields any dbee who is captured or commits crime it is very easy for dbee to commit crime in this town will be sent to the fields to work for life these people are not evil they are just scared they will lose their homes again they feel this is the only way to survive ft yatesthis city also survived intact during the rifts this city is an aging military power in north dakota right after the rifts and about 150 years afterwards ft yates controlled all of north dakota but they were slow in developing new technology and passed in the arms race their empire slowly started to crumble until all they controlled was their own city the citizens still view themselves as the rulers of north dakota their military contains mostly upgraded b52 and aged glitter boys 60 of armor gone the city is also crumbling due to the years of neglect an infighting the town is ruled by the council of generals who is lead by the grand marshal 80 of the government officials are corrupt when the council makes laws they apply to all of north dakota even though the rest of north dakota might not be aware of this ft yates still has roving police still wandering the land handing out punishment and fines to all lawbreakers arenathis town started out small outpost for the gromek but soon other dbee found out about the outpost and fled there hoping to find security the gromek do nt mind these people as long as they pay taxes in return they protect the dbees from outside dangers the town is totally without any laws it is survival of the fittest inside this town as long as they dont bother the gromek they can do whatever they want the only humans in this town are slaves to the dbees their is no organization in the planning of the town wherever you want to build you can in fact you will see houses on top of older houses in some crowded areas even the houses do nt look similar each one is different and varied depending on the persons race new townthis town was first settled by ft yates back in the height of its power since then though they have grown fiercely independent they work hard to be totally independent of everyone else if asked to join any group or federation of cities they will not accept under any condition even if faced with certain death if they do nt join they would still do it alone the town is largely an agriculture society not much in the way of industry or trade the weapons they use are handed down from father to son to son and so on it is not uncommon for person to use 200 year old laser rifle xaxxlethis is the farthest west xiticix has ever been currently no other city is aware of the xiticix if allowed to get foothold in north dakota they might never be able to get them out luckily the colony is pretty small and does not contain queen yet the xiticix will try to keep their location secret for as long as they can meaning no prisoners whatsoever not even as slaves faritontheir is huge energy dome surrounding the entire town and surrounding fields this dome is bluish clear and can take up to 2000 md and can regenerate at 1d6 10 mdc round somehow the inhabitants can get out of the dome without shutting it off

the cyberknight people view them as the saviors of humanity and protector of the downtrodden dbee most communities will openly aid cyberknight anyway they can when cyberknight rides into town the people forget about their fears for little while an enjoy life in fact holovids glamorize the cyberknights depicting them as the hero of the land and defender of justice in truth the reason for the cyberknights fame is because of the silver rangers silver rangers are the unsung hero of north dakota they often travel alone roaming the countryside righting wrongs they travel into town solve the problem then leave sort of like the lone ranger because the silver rangers do nt stick around for to long the people think they were cyberknights since they helped the town like cyberknight should the cyberknights in north dakota are little different than the one found roaming the land outside of dakota the knights are more aloof and more snobbish than normal they view themselves as above the rest of the population and that people will always need saving they think the people could nt live without the aid of the knight for better description think of derek crownguard from the dragonlance novels transplanted to the rifts dimension the main population of cyberknights are located in the gregor monastery this is not the famed lord coake monastery here the knights are trained in the ways of knighthood the monastery is lead by an 11th level cyberknight named jt falcon currently falcon is trying to assemble an army of cyberknights right now he has 1500 knights and will have 4000 more in the following year as soon as falcon has assembled enough men roughly 10000 he will wage war against evil supernatural creatures and any evil kingdom unfortunately once these foes are dispatched in north dakota falcon will try to make north dakota his kingdom there are only humans in the monastery falcon will not allow any nonhumans to join the ranks of cyberknights any outside cyberknight will feel little out of place around these cyberknights outside cyberknights will not try to stop falcon until it is too late to do anything the following is different about the north dakota cyberknight than the normal one found in the rifts rpg to live is the same fair play same unless you are nonhuman then the cyberknight will do the things he would normally not do nobility same as valor same as honor same as courtesy same as same as silver ranger occ the silver rangers are an organization of men and women dedicated to helping people survive the terrible plots of fiendish characters the rangers are of sort of like the cyberknights except the rangers help person or small town while the knights will help an area or big city usually ignoring the pleas of single person or small town the rangers are usually very quiet speaking only when needed to the rangers carry out their duty and leave often before they can be given thanks rangers are not in this business for glory or to make money

but you should never judge book by its cover the brahmagupta are arguably the most powerful dragon that have step foot on earth that was nt always the case though the brahmaguptas were the weakest dragons that all changed the day the power hungry shifter happen to come across their dimension the brahmagupta were dying off they werent able to adapt to their changing planet the shifter enslaved the dragons with the promise of new world and the power to be the strongest dragons known to the universe the shifter had come across an ancient spell believed to be created by the old ones but the shifter does nt know or care the spell creates an amulet that gives the shifter the powers of the wearer and gives the wearer power too until now the shifter could nt find any willing dragons since only dragon may wear the amulet until he found the brahmagupta once the dragon puts on the amulet he ca nt remove it unless it truly never intends to wear it again in which case he will lose the powers given to it by the amulet the powers are on the right side of slashes until now their were only brahmagupta on earth but now their are over 700 brahmagupta that have the amulet due to the

plunging the rod into the chest of the victim the maximum damage the rod can is 120 megadamage the rod can sense what person is and what he is wearing the calculates what it would take to bust through

spell the kingpriest of istar uses in the dragonlance legends series people remember the horror and fear of seeing the dragon but wo nt remember the exact details of the dragon death sensethe dragon is able to sense through the use of ppe where there is going to be major amounts of deaths occurring this sense tell exactly where or when it is going to happen or who is going to die it is more like force that pulls the dragon to the place of oncoming death if you are little confused about this then you should read the book jaws and how the mammoth shark hunts that hunting instinct is good depiction of how this ability works soul trapthis is not what the rumors make it out to be instead of entrapping the soul it absorbs the released ppe that creatures emanate upon death this is different that most other creatures that use ppe to function instead of only using small amount of that released energy and having to use it right away the dragon will store all the released energy and can store for up to months their is limit to how much ppe the dragon can store the limit is 800 ppe their is two ways the dragon can use this ppe ppe dischargethis is the release of all the stored ppe at one time this discharge inflicts 1d610 mdc to the dragon itself once it leaves the dragons body if forms an oddly shaped 50 foot ball of energy that can only go in straight line for 2000 feet

any creature that feeds off ppe will feel stronger for 1d4 rounds and have bonus 1d10 md to their main body ppe withdrawalthe scales can hold the ppe for up to months and while this the dragon can use the ppe anyway it wishes also when dragon reaches 5th level it is able to manipulate ppe even better than before it is able to mold ppe into solid object that resembles anything the dragon wants it to look like the object can walk and do simple tasks but the creation is actually shell of what it is made to resemble it ca nt talk or think and it shall die out after month the dragon has total control over his own creation cost to create one is 100 ppe smoke of angerif the dragon is running low on ppe or has nt come upon any deaths yet it will probably resort to this attack in order get more ppe if character fails roll vs spell at then they fall into rage attacking anything it sees except the dragon the smoke cloud is actually very fine mist that covers 100ft radius for 1d6 rounds feed off ppe when people die their ppe is released from their body ppe is doubled at time of death the dragon is able to absorb any ppe within 100ft radius flaws death dragons do nt like ley lines or nexus points this is due to the fact that their scales overload in their attempt to absorb all the ppe if the dragons is to close to ley line 500ft it will eventually die 1st minute dragon is slightly dizzy to

harbingers of destruction wherever they went their seem to be death this made dd look like evil beasts that kill people and suck their soul into hellishlike imprisonment and they were only released to be eaten by the dd these rumors are somewhat true but due to peoples fear have blown out of proportion it is not entirely impossible to hear tales of villages leaving at the sight or rumor of dd nearby if you managed to ever talk to dragon about dd they seem indifferent and wo nt answer your question where the death dragons came from the dd are from the unknown planet dragii the planet is nearing extinction due to the overpopulation of dd fortunately for the dd and unfortunately for the shifter shifter happened to come across dragii through mistake create rift spell the dd killed the shifter immediately the dds using the last of their ppe were able to keep the rift open long enough for few hundred dd to escape to earth the dragons they left behind will probably die out within 50

and information the lancer are squadron of pilots that originated in lazlo they were created when the council felt that an attack from the coalition was imminent they picked the best men available and trained them to become pilots of the new experimental plane the lancer has to be quick thinking and be able to endure vast amounts of stress both physically and mentally currently there are only 50 pilots and 35 planes the council is still not sure if they should continue making lancer fighters as of right now there is only one squadron of 15 planes permanently stationed in lazlo the rest are deployed in either pairs or by themselves throughout old america whether the pilots succeed or not will determine if they will continue making lancers future the future depends on you if you succeed then there is good chance the lancers will reach full production if you continually fail than the project will be scrapped while low level pilots will be posted lazlo protecting it from evil dbees and humans once you reach scout status you will be sent out fighting in the name of lazlo capturing wanted criminals and thwarting enemies of lazlo as the coalition turns their attention to lazlo you will be asked to fly more missions against the coalition these ideas are entirely up to the gm but sooner or later you should realize that the coalition will attack lazlo death horse npc most of these

horde of rapid flies have been known to destroy an entire crop in under an hour the flies are not sentient they react just like any other insect their main concerns are to eat and to reproduce if they are alone an attacked their main objective is to escape the rapid flies are much more confident when they are in large groups they are much more likely to attack instead of retreating another problem with the rapid fly is that they carry an unknown virus that is believed to be regular cold in their own dimension but on earth this virus is deadly as of right now their is no known cure for this

the population there and made it haven for dbee many are the tales of atrocities by the hands of monsters it is said that they have set up camps for humans to die in this brings back memories of auschwitz in the 1940 right now north dakota cities are not powerful enough to help the coalition either does not know or care about the human plight in south dakota the coalition has yet to lift finger to help minnesota minnesota is almost barren of with tolkeen being the only exception the xiticix have tripled their size in the last three years threatening to decimate all of humanity in minnesota and the surrounding areas fortunately prosek has realized that his own empire is threatened and has called truce between the coalition and tolkeen together they hope to defeat the xiticix sadly once the xiticix have been defeated the coalition will resume its siege of tolkeen fear for tolkeen for now they have to fight two enemies montana montana is haven for humanity too far away for the coalition to have any influence on them the inhabitants live peacefully the only problem is the magic zone located in the western portion of the old state but even that is not major problem the zone is controlled by 26th level great horned dragon he considers the zone to be his domain nothing can come in or out without his approval only once has anything ever escaped from the zone the ones lucky enough were group of death dragons an only small number at that 300 see montana as the next great civilization waiting to happen the people here are hard working industrious lot while their techlevel is low 19th century they are eagerly learning everything thing they can it will be interesting to see if they can survive with all this doom and despair surrounding them winnipeg canada not by erin tarn winnipeg is hustling trade town of the splugorth relatively few outsiders know about this town splynncryth set this town up few years back in the hopes to corner the market in technology in the northwest so far his plan is working very well that could all change if the coalition were to get wind of this town the paranoid leaders of chittown will not allow threat like that so close to its borders chitown would forget about other plans of invasions an attack winnipeg until it is just ashes the town defenses consist of two dragon dreadnoughts 20 creax armored rovers 10 insecton land rovers 50 kittani serpent power armors and 25 equestrian power armors reactions by other powers this is how other powers would react upon learning about mccoyville and space station coalition if the coalition was ever to learn that mccoyville still exists they would send in three divisions to utterly destroy mccoyville they would also occupy all of north dakota to ensure that mccoyville will never again rise from the ashes if they were to find out about the space station they would immediately ally themselves with the new german republic they will order their scientists to find away of getting into space so that they can dispatch with this threat the paranoid leaders of the coalition would unite the human population forgetting about past differences and set them on common goal to destroy the space station new german republic the ngr would not care about mccoyville and might actually try to trade with them if they were to find out about the station they would become extremely interested in getting the technology to get up there they would do anything to get that technology even if means helping the coalition destroy mccoyville mechanoids the mechanoids would not care about mccoyville seeing it as to far away to do anything if they find out about the station they too would become extremely interested they would view the space station as way to contact their fellow mechanoids they would too would do almost anything to get up their archie seven upon learning about such powerful station so close to the moon he would forge an alliance with the rest of the stations in order to destroy the station archie and the other stations can not allow earthlings to get foothold in space they do not want evil monsters and humans to destroy their environment like they did on earth so long ago atlantis if atlantis was to learn about mccoyville splynncryth would like to enter trade agreement with the to further is strength in the northeast but if they do nt agree he will not push the matter not wanting anyone to find out about winnipeg the station would be of little interest to him for earth is the true commodity for him this is how other powers would react upon learning about winnipeg coalition they would do an all out attack on this city not stopping until winnipeg is destroyed the coalition can not allow the splugorth so close to their borders ngr to far away to make any difference they might supply coalition with some weapons mccoy mccoy has been to atlantis and knows that the splugorth are ruthless traders he will start private war with winnipeg trying to make splynncryth give up on the idea of northeastern trading region mechanoids do nt care this is how other powers would react upon learning about arpita coalition they would immediately occupy north dakota they can not something this powerful so close to their borders atlantis they would not try and prevent arpita growth unless it interferes with their trading in winnipeg if it does interfere splynncryth will send an army into the badlands to wipeout arpita and his minions atlanteans they would treat arpita and his minions the same way they treat vampires npc note these are the
