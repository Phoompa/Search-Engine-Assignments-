the vain crow once upon time restless crow decided to go farther away than usual from home and friends suddenly in farmyard he met pair of peacocks what wonderful birds they were the crow had never seen such beautiful feathers and he timidly asked the regallooking birds what they were we re peacocks one of them replied spreading its tail and as the peacock strutted about showing the crow his magnificent feathers he screamed as peacocks do bursting with admiration the crow said goodbye and flapped away but as he flew home he could not forget the two peacocks what fine feathers they must be so happy being so beautiful and he gazed down sadly at his own ugly plumes from that day on he could not help thinking about the spiendour of the peacocks and his own plain feathers he even stopped looking at himself in the pond water for every time he did so it made him even more depressed he got into the habit of spying on the peacocks and the more he watched them strut royally around the more envious he was of their beauty one day he noticed that one of the peacocks had dropped feather when the sun went down the crow picked it up and hid it away for days on end he watched the peacocks and found another feather when he had four he could wait no longer he stuck the peacock feathers onto his own tail using pine resin and started to parade up and down for his friends to admire just look at my gorgeous tail he said proudly not ugly like you out of my way you moth eaten crows the crows amazement soon changed to indignation then they started to laugh and jeer at their vain companion you re nothing but crow yourself even with those flashy feathers they jeered and you re silly as well as ugly replied the conceited crow haughtily and off he went to live with the peacocks when the peacocks set eyes on the stranger they thought the crow was just another peacock who for some reason had lost most of his feathers and they felt sorry for him but the crow vainer than ever wanted to attract greater admiration and foolish idea came into his head he tried to scream the way the peacocks do when they fan their tails but the harsh craw craw craw quickly betrayed the crow the furious peacocks pecked the stolen feathers off and chased the crow away poor crow for when sad and downcast he went back to his frlends he was given exactly the same rough treatment nobody would speak to him and all the crows turned their backs on him for trying to be what he was not
