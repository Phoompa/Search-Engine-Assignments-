the wolf and the seven kids once upon time mother goat lived in pretty little house with her seven kids mother often had to leave home to do the shopping and on that fateful day she had given her children the usual warnings before setting off to market you must nt open the door to anyone do nt forget there wicked wolf lurking about here it black with horrible paws and nasty deep voice if it knocks keep the door tightly shut mother goat words were wise indeed for as she was telling one of her neighbours about her fears the wolf disguised as peasant was hiding close by listening to every word good very good said the wolf to himself if the goat goes market iii drop by her house and gobble the kids then trying not to look too conspicuous the wolf hurried along to the goat house there he threw off his disguise he then growled in deep voice open the door open the door it mother ve just come back from market open the door when the kids heard the deep voice they remembered their mother warning from behind the barred door they said to the wolf we know who you are you re the wolf our mother has sweet gentle voice not deep nasty one like yours go away we ll never open the door to you and though the wolf banged furiously on the door the kids though trembling with terror refused to let him into the house and so the door remained shut then the wolf had brainwave he dashed off to the baker and got big cake dripping with honey he hoped this would sweeten his voice and in fact after eating it his voice did nt sound quite so deep over and over again he practised imitating mother goat voice you see he heard it in the woods when he felt certain he could easily be mistaken for mother goat herself he rushed back to the house and the seven kids open the door open the door it mother ve just come back from market open the door he called this time the kids had doubts the voice did rather sound like mother and they were about to unlock the door when the black kid suspiciously cried mother let us see your foot without thinking the wolf raised black hairy paw and the kids knew that the wolf had come back you re not our mother she does nt have horrid black paws cried the kids go away you wicked wolf and once more in spite of all his hard work the wolf found the door locked against him the wolf ran down to the mlll and found sack of flour he thrust his paws into it until they were pure white ll trick them this time he said mmm my mouth watering already hungry my tummy empty and my trousers are falling off ll swallow these tender kids whole again he knocked on the door open the door open the door it mother ve just come back from market open the door the voice seemed exactly like mother but the wary kids quickly called out mother let us see your foot the wily wolf lifted snow white paw and the kids now reassured threw open the door what shock they received an enormous set of jaws with sharp fangs growled fiercely cruel claws reached out for their prey the kids scattered in terror one dived under the table while other crawled below the bed another kid hid in the cupboard and one tried to hide in the oven though the stove was still hot one kid crouched inside barrel and one hid in the grandfather clock there he huddled holding his breath as the wolf hunted down his brothers one by one the kids were pulled from their hiding places all except for the kid in the clock the wicked wolf appetite did not pass until he had found them and swallowed each in single gulp the only one to escape was the little black kid for the wolf never imagined that there was room for kid inside the very narrow grandfather clock in the meantime mother goat had really come back from market when from distance she noticed that the door was ajar she rushed home her heart in her mouth she had sinking feeling what she feared had really happened the wicked wolf had gobbled up all her children she dropped into chair sobbing bitterly but as she cried the door of the grandfather clock swung open and out ran the black kid mummy mummy wept the kid it was terrible the wolf came and think he eaten all my brothers my poor child sobbed mother goat you re the only one left that evil brute has gobbled them all not long after mother goat and her son left the house to take stroll in the garden suddenly she heard low wheezing sound someone was snoring heavily it was the greedy wolf his feast of kids had been too much for him and he was fast asleep dead to the world in flash mother goat had brainwave she said to her son run and fetch me needle and thread and pair of scissors with these she swiftly slit open the wolf stomach as she had hoped the ravenous brute had swallowed every kid whole there they were all stlll alive alive inside his tummy one by one out they popped from the wolf tummy hurry hurry not sound we must get away before he wakens up wait fetch me heap of stones and so they filled the wolf stomach with stones and stitched it up again the wolf woke later with raging thirst what heavy tummy have he said ve eaten too much all these kids but when he went down the river to drink his tummy full of stones tipped him over and he fell into the water the weight took him straight to the bottom and the goat and her kids shrieked with joy as he sank the wicked wolf was dead and the kids trotted home happily with mother
