the crab and the heron once upon time an elderly heron made his home in pond full of fish he was stiff and slow in his old age and he did nt find it easy to catch his lunch however he decided to use his wits he went to see crab said to be great chatterbox and in mock frightened volce told him the latest rumour certain birds friends of mine say that the lakeside fishermen will be coming here soon with their nets they re going to take away all the fish ll have no meals left everything will be gone and the fish will end up in the frying pan the crab quickly scuttled away to the banks of the pond and dived in to tell the fish the awful news the frightened fish begged the crab for good advice and he returned to the heron they re all scared stiff and do nt know which way to turn while you yourself snap up few now and again it against your interests if they go so what shall we do the heron pretended to be lost in thought then he said ll tell you what can carry them few at time to pond hidden in the forest they ll be quite safe there but will the fish trust me whether they were scared of the fishermen or maybe the crab had glib tongue at any rate the fish agreed to this strange offer the heron began his trips between pond and forest but the crab noticed that the heron made excuses for dallying on the way what was more the crab keen eye noticed that the heron tummy was now good deal plumper days later when all the fish had been rescued from the pond the heron said to the crab do nt you want to be rescued too he asked certainly replied the crab bend over ll climb on to your neck hate to make your beak tired when they were far from the pond the crab saw that the ground was littered with fish bones he clung tightly to the heron neck and said ve no intention of coming to the same end as the fish now just deposit me gently into the water not letting go of your neck till feel safe and from that day on crabs and herons have always loathed each other and try to avoid meeting
