the birdlover holiday copyright 1991 andrew varga it was just before dawn tom began another vigil staring through the snowstorm at the dark shape in his back yard it had been pleasant morning ritual for year give or take few days he smiled remembering his delight at unwrapping the package from alice and the kids it was the biggest bird feeder he ever seen he chipped the hole and forced the post into the frozen earth that very day every morning since he come down to the den extra early before alice and the kids got up he sit in his favorite chair sip the day first cup of coffee and wake up to the variety of birds that came to feed there were many sparrows of course small group that seemed to keep pretty much to itself consisted entirely of rare english variety there were two regular pairs of bright red cardinals one pair tom had traced to their nest in the big oak that grew in the burke front lawn three houses down family of nuthatches had made home in small hollow in the old maple out behind the garage numerous robins and redwinged blackbirds had come and gone throughout the summer his favorite had been big old bluejay hed affectionately named sam sam came to the feeder regularly twice week monday and thursday mornings between six and sixthirty but something changed for nearly two weeks the feeder sat full and untouched winter had come early and with enthusiasm he could think of no reason other than maybe squirrels were trying to help themselves to the seeds tom wallowed through the drifts to check the feeder every morning as he left for work if there had been any tracks he had nt seen them he found clue the morning before frozen drop of blood and blue feather lay in the snow at the base of the post that very evening after the children had been put to bed he loaded his 22 caliber rifle and carefully hid it in the closet by the back door suddenly tom stiffened in his chair something moved out there in the morning twilight there it was again something was moving in the shadow under the bush by the bird feeder hurrying through the kitchen and into the back room tom yanked his boots on over his bare feet and hurried into his coat he felt in the pocket for the flashlight he tucked away there to keep the kids from swiping its batteries taking the rifle from the closet he snuck out the back door the snow was drifted deep and billowed over the tops of his boots melting against his thin pajamas the icy wind made his eyes water crouching he searched for sign of the concrete walk he slapped the flashlight against the side of his leg few times before it came on someone had traded batteries he made mental note to have talk with tom junior tom pointed the yellowing beam toward the bush he thought he could just make out shape underneath suddenly there were two glowing reflections shining back at him as he raised the rifle the flashlight went dead and the reflections disappeared tom took aim in the general direction of where they had been moment ago the rifle made soft putt the sound muffled in the wind he wallowed toward it through the drifts he squinted hard as he crouched low beneath the winterburdened branches tom face was only inches away from it when violent sneeze sent him reeling back into the snowbank he knew what it was crawling back under the bush he felt around for something that resembled fur it was puffy the next door neighbor white angora puffy had dark wet spot just over one eye glad the randolfs are visiting her parents for the holidays he muttered as he stood and turned toward the house he saw his bedroom light go on damn he said to himself alice is up now what am going to do tom hurried through the snow toward the garage holding puffy at arms length before him under different circumstances tom would probably have missed the bulge in the snow that hid son randy neglected skateboard puffy flew one way and the rifle the other as tom landed he wallowed among the drifts on all fours searching finding both with numbing fingers he slogged his way to the garage he grabbed the handle to the overhead door locked his keys were in the pocket of his pants upstairs in his bedroom kicking small grave in the snowdrift by the garage he dashed as best as he could back into the house yanking off his boots he returned the rifle to the closet and ran through the kitchen and around to the stairs he listened carefully as he snuck up them peeking around the corner at the top he smiled to himself the bathroom light squinted around the closed door he tiptoed past it and down the hall to their bedroom finding his pants on the chair he silently withdrew his keys turning to go he stubbed his toe hard on the edge of the dresser that he helped alice move the day before fighting against the need to scream in pain tom limped back along the hallway and down the stairs returning to the back room he gingerly stepped into his house slippers his toes had already swollen too much to fit into his boots again outdoors he hurried to the garage the snow stuck to his already wet pajamas and started to freeze it was few long minutes before he found puffy he opened the garage door slung the dead cat inside closed it and hurried back to the house alice was waiting for him in the back room your face is flushed tom are you coming down with something he got as far as no fi fi before sneeze seemed to shake the house you ve got cold ll make some hot lemonade tom flinched he hated hot lemonade and what did you expect running around out there in your pajamas did you stoke the furnace was just about to dear tom replied his mind scrambling for plausible excuse coal we re running low on coal thought get some firewood to sort of stretch it out alice eyes widened okay so where is it oh forgot he quickly turned to the door tom she called after him what were you doing in the garage tom slowly turned to her and forced smile again scrambling for an answer it too close to christmas to ask oh okay she smiled well hurry up with the furnace the children will be up soon breakfast will be ready when you re done tom had little trouble bringing in the wood the legs of his pajamas had frozen stiff making it difficult to bend his knees he had even more trouble getting the furnace going there were no embers left from the night before midmorning found him breakfasted bathed and relaxing in his favorite chair to the morning newspaper hey dad tom jr asked as he and his brothers and sisters filed into the den can have the keys to the garage tom did nt look up nothing could budge him from his paper if he had looked he would have seen five large bundles of clothing at glance it was impossible to tell that each held now sweating child we re going sledding eleven year old stacy announced yeah dad tom jr said talking louder with each word and the sleds are in the garage tom was halfway through the kitchen before his paper hit the floor ll get them kids he called back over his shouldering its cold outside you all stay right here he dashed into the garage and began desperate search for puffy remains just as he pulled the stiffening form from where it had landed in the corner behind alices stack of planting pots he heard voice call from the house having trouble dad desperately searching for way to dispose of puffy tom jammed it into one of the plastic ice cream tubs that alice always saved yeah having problem he said to himself as he fought to snap the stiff plastic lid hearing the back door slam he just managed to tuck the frozen container inside his shirt as all five children waddled into the garage whatcha got daddy four year old jenny asked tom stood in the corner trapped do nt ask tom jr hushed his sister tom face turned stern as he fought to collect his dignity he slowly walked toward the door and his five children he heard christmas presents whispered among them as he passed and sighed with relief once inside tom ran in circles through the kitchen searching for safe place to hide the tub creak went the floorboard in the living room alice was coming tom put puffy in the only place he could find the freezer he just closed the door as alice entered stay out of the goodies she smilingly scolded

basement he tossed it into the coal bin before running back upstairs alice was in the kitchen when he returned since when do we keep ice cream in the basement she asked all tom could do was put on his do nt know what you re talking about smile and shrug his shoulders alice went to the freezer and removed plastic tub identical to the one tom had just disposed of he gasped as she pried open the lid
