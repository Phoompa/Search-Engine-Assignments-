like to tell you story it happened on friday last october when the leaves were turning colors and the air was getting bit crisp you could feel it deep in your lungs some mornings like an early warning that winter was coming remember it as one of those few days of the year when you could dirve around all day with your car window open but you find yourself choosing to wear sweatshirt or at least put on light jacket instead of just the usual summer tshirt it was midafternoon and had just gotten home from school my mom and dad were both at work and my older brother sean was nt due home for another five weeks he been off at college for two years already not counting the dog was the only one home well saw her pawing at the patio door and let her out to do her thing and scamper around in the back careful not to let her roam too close to the sillman yard they stopped liking her ever since she discovered their tulip garden mr sillman came out and was yelling on and on about how there should be law against keeping rottweilers but that another story anyway was just moping around in the back when the phone rang got it right after the third ring it was nate we been friends since the ninth grade he an interesting character it seems as if hes got connections everywhere you could go anywhere in the state and ask anyone of any importance do you know nate brenner and you probably get yes reply anyway he asked me if wanted to go to party with him that night sure replied who havin it dunno girl work with told me about it she said it be pretty good you want me to drive think should tell you about where nate works he got the coolest job in the world for someone our age that is he writer at our town paper that means he gets great wages for writing about things like the new mall grand opening and maybe take picture or two the hours are pretty unstructerd there and it much cleaner than working at some burger hell like some guys no ll drive had just gotten new chevy type 1o the week before and felt like showing it off restaraunt work really is nt all that bad pulled into his driveway at about seventhirty waited about three minutes and was just about to go up to the door when he came out so where to asked we stopped at the drug store for beer and he then gave me directions as drove it was in an area little more south of us where there were less houses and more trees even though our destination was only fifteen minutes away the frequent pickup truck and occasional barn was quite contrast from the housing developments and neovictorian architecture that was so familiar to us we re in hicksville now nate joked he was fiddling with my tape box playing his favorite selections on the stereo we had stayed on the main road the whole time and was wondering where to turn off it right off the road paper says 8269 so it should be coming up on your left he said we saw an old metal mailbox with the address and pulled into the gravel drive there were two huge maples on the right of the lawn bursting with autumn color the house was brick 7o ranch and from where we were parked you could see through the bay window into the living room it was papered in some beige print saw lot of real earthy light colors but could nt make anything out well we got out and walked up to the front door passing about six or seven other cars including an avocado green cutlass that looked like it was at least fifteen years old we did nt have to wait after our knock someone opened the door for us right away it was some girl who looked like about nineteen he brown hair was braided and ran down just below her shoulders noticed the faded guess jacket and printed blue tank top right away hi she drawled out in long seductive sort of way hi nate replied uh is cathy here she invited us cathy do nt even know her sorry we proceeded in anyway was carrying our beer coors by choice the house was fairly neat and uncluttered inside saw right away that the living room was purely art deco including green painting abouve an alcove and black ceramic cat on glass flower stand forever staring into goldfish bowl we passed this girl and her two friends of whom ca nt even recall what they look like and went into the kitchen nate was looking for cathy and was voluntarily following there was stereo on somewhere in the house for we could hear some good hard music being played recognized it as def leppard pyromania album in the center of the tidy kitchen was large walnut table and about six people all little older than us were gathered round playing poker full and empty beer bottles were scattered all over the place and it looked like they were having good time one of the guys was wearing boston mills ski sweatshirt which recognized as had gone skiing there the year before the two girls that were there both about twenty or so looked like they had too much to drink their actions were kinda slow and their eyes were sort of red and glazed as nate and would say they were getting the glazzies they did nt seem to notice us so we strolled down few steps into the family room the place gave off an indescribable air of comfort the soft brown carpeting dark wood paneling two big plushy sofas next to large bookshelf stocked with reader digest and the like and largescreen tv all contributed to this there were two people sitting by the back door talking quietly in the shadows and we took place on the sofas to start on our beers there were few bowls of nuts here and there and as we drank we tried throwing them up in the air and catching them in our mouths frogstyle needless to say most of the time it failed and we stopped before the floor was too littered the music was kinda loud so we turned down the sound on the tv and watched mtv to it it really lot of fun after about half hour of this and beer short brunette approached us she was wearing mauve paisley top and jeans or something like that nate she exclaimed nate seemed bit jostled by this cathy how are you good you they exchanged other such niceties before walking off ll be back in while nate whispered to me knew they be gone for some time talking and whatnot so checked out the television situation changing the music videos discovered that great movie had been very fond of was on turned up the volume to combat the music in the background and started anouther beer had just gotten into this movie when heard someone coming down from the kitchen it was the girl we saw at the front door she took seat next to me so how are you she asked alright want beer yes thanks she eagerly took one introduced myself and discovered her name as lisa we talked for bit and remember her asking me if wanted to take walk with her outside sure eagerly replied she seemed like really nice person at the time well as we were getting up saw tall dusty haired guy about her age approach her let go honey alright turning to me she sweetly said bye nice girl thought as she marched off with him hand in hand he looked like such jerk at this point just wanted to leave they were still playing cards as walked through the kitchen one of the girls was asleep in some guy lap and the other one looked like she was about to go out at any time the ceramic cat in the living room was lot uglier than when first saw it and was getting mad looking for nate some guy in faded concert shirt gave me halfdrunk beer thanks sarcastically muttered as he walked by remember finally finding him in the basement with cathy playing quarters joined in for few minutes but nate could tell that wanted out of there so he told her that he had to go see ya later cheerily said to cathy as rose they followed me up the stairs the clock in the hall read twelve thirty nate gave cathy hurried goodbye and we left the house in the driveway saw the guy in the concert shirt get into the old cutlass few shouts could nt make out were made to small cluster of people on the lawn and he drove off similarily we got in my car and pulled out had my window rolled down the whole way and was enjoying the country air had to drive with my brights on because it was so dark with all of the huge trees looming overhead and no streetlight around that it was impossible to drive without them we were silent the whole way home by nate mellow radio selections could tell that he was getting tired around some bends on roadside clearing on my side of the car saw about five sets of glowing green eyes deer still did nt feel like talking so did nt mention it to nate lisa was still running through my mind as we pulled into nates drive he said something like call you later and got out that was about all that happened that night never saw lisa or any of those guys again cathy went away for school so it highly doubtful that nate would even get invited to another one of those parties even if he did probably would nt go it not that those people are nt interesting but since then ve met others just as neat and besides it not good to live in the past right
