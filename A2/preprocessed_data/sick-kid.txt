baby daughter in one arm and her sick sword in the other disgusting sword was quite name to be born with but she was worth it after all she would never have even been born had not the intercontinental union of disgusting characters brought sick sword and ringman the paladin together ringman entered from nearby room and smiled at the sight about year ago sick sword had moved the small keep shed gained from the deck of many things to the same clearing in which she and ringman had had their first romantic interlude and the sunlit trees sparkled gaily through the portal spells er windows this place had nt seen any combat in its life and ringman always liked being able to walk around without having to wear plate mail do you know what day this is sick sword asked as she simultaneously carried on telepathic conversation with the sick sword it tuesday ringman chuckled in reply mm hmm it was also one year ago this date that the iudc was completely disbanded oh that right it is is nt it and it also the first anniversary of omnion death thank goodness you got rid of her too she was real pain just sorry that god ii does nt condone going to the outer planes and destroying someone soul otherwise but you would nt want to lose your alignment status now would you ringman assured her mm spose not just do nt like the thought of her taking over hell or coming back as 49thlevel archlich or planetravelling to any of the other outer planes and wreaking any more havoc ringman had nt heard of this last one she can do that well not for another 99 years and even then she couldnt get away with much most of her power lay in her magic items and they ve all been stored away in the dungeon uh you do mean few levels below the dungeon dont you yeah yeah well it all the same place sick sword agreed as she put down her sick sword had to do something with that old freehold of mine did nt and what better use is there for stone walls and adamantite bars than to hold all the surviving union members ah yes wild max the grandfather of assassins rango the 17thlevel ranger dirk the destructive the 20thlevel anti paladin da bad dude the 31stlevel evil illusionist and that dastardly 20thlevel paladin peter perfect hope never see any of em again without their magic items and stripped of their psionic powers they re just as harmless as 31stlevel kittens ringman suppressed shudder and decided to change the subject so what were you discussing with your sword just now he getting pretty perceptive sick sword noted was just seeing how well it was doing in the major benign powers department and how many major powers does it have now it up to five two more and get another prime power ringman shook his head and snorted disbelieving chuckle as he turned and walked out of the room always thought it took more than year for something to become an artifact he muttered the sick sword rate of power gain was pretty impressive she figured have eight extraordinary powers and eight special purposes the sick sword had told her almost an artifact right now why not let me go that last extra step and become real artifact she had agreed but she also made sure that the sword picked up enough malevolent and side effects to keep its personality score below hers the sword therefore now had alignment of possessor permanently changed to that of item and user has limited omniscience as well as bestowing total immunity to all forms of mental and psionic attack she fingered disgusting sword chin lightly and the baby replied with hi mommy you feel nice age months was little late to start speaking but she would catch up shed need all the skills she could muster if she were to become as powerful as sick sword wanted her to be and then again she thought as she rubbed her belly if disgusting sword did nt measure up there was always the next child she was pregnant with you rango screamed clawing through the adamantite bars you re the one who got me into this mess you ought to be in one of these cells just as much as any of us clerasil the 38thlevel high priest maintained his smugness if you recall changed my mind yeah right and suppose none of the other union members gave you aaannyyy peer pressure to stay in the group that right that because you were away from headquarters when you defected true true but wierd dough was nt away from headquarters he was also nearly fried by that halfelven ultraarch devil koenieg middle monk and melnic the loud thought the risk was worth taking my god iv man wierd dough did nt even let me in on what was going on you knew about them later omnion was practically screaming their names out at every turn from what hear you could always have come over to the right side up your sixteenfootstop clerasil clerasil in the most insulting gesture he could dream up grinned at him and left without another word looks like rango has nt calmed down yet wierd dough the 49thlevel archmage commented when clerasil joined him yeah yeah and he sortof right clerasil was looking slightly down and away we did make the union in the first place after all hmmph do nt think peter perfect was nt instrumental in that too koenieg the 14thlevel great druid broke his druidic silence it is very convenient for you then to have peter perfect to dump all of your blame and guilt on wierd dough blinked at that clerasil only looked down and away even more middle monk the grand master of flowers meanwhile approached da bad dude cell how ya doin da bad dude the illusionist growled if had my spell books right now cream you middle monk folded his arms no you would nt okay then da bad dude decided if had my spell books and my psionic powers cream you no you would nt well then if had my spell books and my psionic powers and my magic items cream you no you would nt middle monk turned and walked away all right then da bad dude shouted after him if had my spell books and my psionic powers and my magic items and my artifacts cream you middle monk rejoined the other antidisgustingcharacters melnic the loud the magnaalumnae bard looked around so why is nt sick sword on these little prison tours any more she says it because she does nt believe in laughing at the prisoners wierd dough said which is ridiculous because everybody likes to gawk at the bad guys actually she hasnt been around recently because he made cradle out of his arms she has little gaga to take care of clerasil shook his head told her not to take off that ring of protection aah she probably wanted it that way she is mortal human after all and she does have to worry about the next generation clerasil cocked his head to one side so are you er um yes well ahem you see have nt had uh much time for family life recently yeah that it not much time oh said middle monk you seemed to have plenty of time for that cute blond apprentice sorceress last that different wierd dough stammered she needed help learning her um somatic technique ll bet what did you teach her to cast sleep spell well you re just jealous because you could nt score with any of the female recruits in your monastery clerasil intervened youve got your monastery middle monk you wierd dough have your wizard college you melnic the loud have your faculty position at ollamh you koenieg have your trees and have my church of clerasilism weve been out of the disgusting character scene for over year now do nt even know why we bother to come to the dungeon any more to chortle at peter perfect wierd dough melnic the loud and middle monk replied peter perfect heard that and clenched his teeth he was the greatest thing on horseback until those wimps decided to join up with sick sword now he already spent whole damn year rotting away between adamantite bars and unbreakable stone walls they stripped him of all his magic items theyd whittled him down to zero psionic strength points feebleminded him inflicted him with idiocy through an ego whip then healed both the idiocy and the feeblemind to leave him exactly as he was before except without any psionic powers they dispelled every spell he had made permanent upon him and they been feeding him terrible meals every day since then without any dessert he show em he get out and get even with them somehow sick sword second baby was just as beautiful girl as the first especially considering that they both had 18 charisma in fact they both had straight 18 all the way across the board she named this second child ridiculous sword in the hope that she be even more powerful than her first daughter she also hoped that disgusting sword would nt mind if she played favorites do nt play favorites mommy disgusting sword warned her so much for that idea ringman entered the nursery and put his hands on ridiculous sword may he asked be my guest sick sword shrugged ringman picked up the little girl and held her close to his chest ridiculous sword liked that she always liked being held by daddy she reached up and ran her tiny fingers through his beard so ringman said you re going to bring them up to be weapons masters then clerics then magicusers right no silly they re going to be druids first uh druids sure first they become druids and work their way up to 14th level then they change to monk then at 17th level they change to thief then my goodness what are they going to be characters with seven classes eight classes actually after thief comes paladin then comes illusionist then cleric then magicuser and finally weapons master figured if you put weapons master last you could get to the highest level in that class and that way you could do even more perlevel damage in melee combat oh wow you re raising them to be the last word in killing machines ridiculous sword sensed his anxiety and withdrew sick sword what use is there in making them into disgusting characters sick sword frowned do nt ever call them that why not you re disgusting character just because you did nt join the union of disgusting characters does nt mean you did nt make yourself just as powerful as they were look mister selfrighteous we ve been over this before made myself disgusting so that could get rid of the disgusting characters you know it would have been impossible to stop them otherwise you were there and that just the point they re not around anymore you do nt need our kids to kill centaurs and take their four onemilliongoldpiece gems in fact who to say that one of them might not turn powerhungry and abuse her disgusting abilities sick sword eyes turned to steel she lunged from her chair and snatched ridiculous sword from ringman arms thats just about the lowest suggestion you could make paladin these are my children can keep my kids on the right side they re my kids too not if you re going to raise them to be wimps like yourself sick sword shuddered slightly at having said that then turned her eyes away and looked at her daughters instead ringman walked over to dresser pulled open small drawer and took out pack of cards he slapped them down loudly on the bureau top to get sick sword attention sick sword gasped my hero collection of commonly used sayings what are you doing with them ringman put them in his left shirt pocket you obviously wo nt be needing them any more get out it was simple poignant command sick sword hon if you ca nt take get out get out of my keep ringman stopped cold out of the whole house get out and do nt come back she pointed her helm of telepathy flared dim red she psionically dominate his will if she had to openmouthed ringman slowly turned and walked out the nursery door what had he brought upon himself get out she called after him he walked down the corridor to the foyer half sad and half dumbstruck he heard ridiculous sword muffled voice cry daddy but nothing else my deity my deity he thought he glanced at the stone walls around him half stunned and half in sorrow knowing he probably never see them again despite the interior decorations this place was still converted castle and thus had all the standard fortifications the vertical notch in the outer wall for instance was called an arrow slit and ringman had always thought that was just about the most suggestive name for something he ever heard that comforted him little now he took his composite longbow and his quiver of and arrows off their pegs by the arrow slit and stared solemnly back at the nursery that was now around the corner get out sick sword insisted xray vision ringman thought halfway in contempt no clairvoyance now get out he shook his head and would have chuckled were things not so grim he put on the suit of plate mail still standing in the hall while he looked for his periapt of proof against poison periapts were always easy to confuse with any ordinary gems that might happen to be lying around he found it though thanks to the big white he painted on its side after securing the adamantitealloyed armor to his body he strapped his hand axe and holy longsword to either side finally he picked up his shield and slid his arm through it one more trinket caught his eye and he felt even worse for having forgotten it it was sick sword ring of shooting stars yearandahalf ago right after the downfall of the disgusting characters he given her the only ring he had which was his own ring of shooting stars that sweet sick sword had told him but insisted that he take her ring of shooting stars both to make them even and in case he ever needed shooting stars ring again of course he later recovered his old 3inafivefootradius ring of protection since he used up his potions and had two more slots available within his magic item limits but at times he had cherished the ring she exchanged with him he picked up the ring turned it over in his hand almost put it back down and finally slid it over his left ring finger with sigh he opened the outer door looked out solemnly then looked back one last time sick sword he began get out came the reply still love you get out and so he did he had only one last stop to make and that was at the onehorse stall just off the east side of the keep warhorse old boy ringman addressed his warhorse it looks like we ll be riding off alone again the horse neighed in apparent sympathy and understanding ringman checked the horse hooves yes the horseshoes of speed were still firmly in place beneath the horseshoes of the zephyr he hauled out his warhorse old suit of magic plate barding and began to put it on him the horse did nt mind seeing that the armor was nearly weightless odd the dungeon master must have decided to publish another official book since the horse plate barding had dropped from to and was now only meteorite iron steel unlashing the horse reins from the hitching post he put his right foot in the right meteoritesteel stirrup pulled himself up onto the meteoritesteel saddle and urged the horse forward with sulken giddyap he could nt believe sick sword had actually thrown him out she was his girlfriend effectively his wife and she just tossed him out like all their months together had meant nothing he shook his head hard why had he pushed her so hard about the way she should raise their kids could nt he have just talked her out of her position more slowly now those poor fatherless children would have an even bigger chance of turning to the wrong side he taken an oath he assured himself he taken an oath when he became paladin to uphold truth justice and the lawfulgood way like the impossible dream he would fight for the right without question or pause and be willing to march into hell for heavenly cause he had to tell her straight out that she was raising their kids to be just as disgusting of characters as the ones they both despised maybe she cool down eventually maybe she even see it his way he rode off into the wilderness he did nt feel like going back into town right away the old iudc headquarters at the bank of crysglass lake in fact would probably provide the solitude he needed if it was nt swarming with scavenging looters who needed that old sick sword anyway after all from one centaur she gained four million experience points and from being instrumental in saving central earth hed gained enough experience points to put him fourth of the way to his next level peter perfect had nt heard many things from all the times the antidisgusting characters had come to gawk at him but hed heard enough every magic item and magic artifact the union had had was stored in some vault few levels below the dungeon this included his sentient holy sword prometheus he crossed his legs on the floor and tried as best he could to let his mind slip into alpha state he wondered why he had never thought of this before prometheus the word echoed in his mind prometheus hear me the sword should answer eventually even if peter wasnt telepathic any more his sword still was prometheus hear you peter perfect response the sword heard him at least he hoped that dull voice in his head was the sword and not something hed made up prometheus where are you in dark vault surrounded by bits of enchanted junk think few levels below ground in freehold basement what signal strength are you reaching me at really strong figure you could nt be more than fifty feet away say why did nt you use any of your telepathic powers to call me because the antidisgusting characters stripped me of all my psychic abilities listen can you cut your way through the ceiling sure can try but can only animate myself for one minute peter perfect sighed yeah that right your telekinesis only lasts that long well give it try and see what happens okay the voice agreed deep within chamber beneath the dungeon something moved it wriggled its way through all the helms of brilliance and rings of elemental command that had been heaped on top of it and shot up impaling itself in the ceiling there it sawed and pried enough of the stones loose for its hilt to fit through slid all the way up to the next level and found darkened room there too made it up one level the voice told peter perfect but you re still ways above me estimate you re twenty or twentyfive feet away well your teek still has some time to run plow up through another level roger the object shot up through the darkness and impacted the ceiling peter perfect could see the glowing green blade sticking though his own cell floor it working prometheus peter perfect urged it on with his own voice work your way up through the rock the sword blade jutted its full length through the stone and smacked into its own hilt ca nt go any further it spoke to peter directly can get my blade or my handle though but my tk almost gone and ca nt work hole big enough to fit my hilt through by now everyone attention was drawn to peter perfects cell even wild max the grandfather of assassins was getting interested then turn around and stick your grip through the hole peter perfect insisted ll take it from there okay but the blade withdrew from sight and switched to telepathy hurry up almost out of lift the grip of the sword barely managed to poke itself through the hole it shuddered and started to drop and at just that instant peter whipped out his hand and grabbed the handle gotcha he cried yaaaaay all the other disgusting prisoners cheered peter perfect acknowledged the cheers of his audience then started to pull the sword loose come on give he insisted futilely trying to pull the sword through the hole with his makeshift titan strength what do they make the floors out of in these places anyway interlocking silicate stones containing trace quantities of mithral bound together by mortar laced with 73 percent mithral the sword told him far more sturdy than the stuff they made the last floor out of prometheus peter perfect said as he continued pulling yes shut up peter started jamming the sword backandforth bits of rock crumbled away finally he gave good stiff yank and the whole assembly sprang out of the ground and held itself upright in his right hand all right prometheus peter cheered we re team again now let get out of this rat trap he swung the sword around edgeon at the bars of his cell the sword thwacked against bar made loud ringing sound and shook in his hand the bar was nt even scratched damn peter cursed that right solid adamantite bars the pure metal is and you re only holy avenger well the floor is just plain old mithrallaced and that only so it looks like we re gon na have to tunnel our way out he hacked at the ground with prometheus widening the old gash by several centimeters he stuck the sword in the crack and began to saw in two minutes he nearly completed full circle finally he withdrew his holy sword and stamped his foot down hard on the sawloosened section of floor the little tab still holding it on broke and the disk fell through with crash peter triumphantly jumped down the hole landed on top of the slab he just loosened and added enough weight to the alreadypunctured floor beneath him to break it as well and continue on down until he landed in pile of miscellaneous magic items shaking himself back to his senses he held prometheus up high and looked around the green glow from the sword illuminated everything within twenty foot radius and everything within that radius looked wonderful this is it peter perfect cried this is where all our stuff is stored in fact yep there it is my old suit of plate mail he pulled himself up onto his legs with his makeshift titan strength the permanent potion he had in effect did nt increase his tohit chances you see and walked through the minefield of magic items to his suit of armor he was about to put it on when shimmer off to one side caught his eye the sword green light glittered off coat of very fine chain links on the other hand peter perfect mused why bother with just runofthemill suit of plate mail he crossed to the chain coat and took it off its wall peg when can have the invulnerable coat of arnd good choice said prometheus thoroughly impressed did nt that used to belong to omnion aah omnion dead now anyway peter replied pulling the coat over his head she wo nt miss it he got the coat all the way on and put his arms through the sleeves hmmm this only goes out as far as my upper arms and down as far as my groin gon na have to pirate the leggings and vambraces from my old magic plate mail he did his forearms and legs were now armor class he clanked the vambraces on his arms together ahh adamantite alloy once again it feels so good to have this stuff back on my body he tried to impale himself with prometheus but it only sent up few sparks and this mail is totally unbreachable wonder what kind of stuff it made out of pure adamantite would only be now then where my axe of the dwarvish lords he found his axe of course after he located scarab of protection to let him resist the axe malevolent effects he also found germanium ring that would be ring of protection and an obsidian ring ring of regeneration his cup and talisman of al akbar were hidden behind somebody else suit of leather armor he eventually collected helm of brilliance helm of telepathy helm of teleportation which he carefully stacked on his head medallion of esp with empathy all the rings of elemental command rod of lordly might cube of force vampiric ring of regeneration five dull gray ioun stones which he remembered he did nt need since his psionics were gone his cloak of protection girdle of titan strength one pair of reverse eyes of petrification his warhorse which had been stowed in portable hole for the last yearand ahalf his warhorse plate barding which was still gautlets of dexterity gauntlets of ogre power ring of raise dead fully book of infinite spells or two every other ring he could possibly use he could stack them on the inner and outer sides of his gauntlets his longsword of green dragon slaying and all the other various oddsandends he had when the union was still in force it was good thing he had enough portable holes to carry everything in getting out was the easy part he simply knocked open the vault door from the inside mounted his warhorse rode across to the staircase and galloped out to freedom hey prometheus complained are nt you going to free the rest of your comrades are you kidding most of them are evil rango the ranger is nt evil that wimp you must be kidding let him find his own way out do nt you even feel obliged to get back at clerasil and wierd dough for the way they treated him and you no no peter explained vengeance is nt my style now to get even he thought nastily tiamat rolled lazily over onto her back and laid another white dragon egg this one was of the small variety so the white dragon that grew out of it would nt have quite as many hit dice as it could she wondered if she should bother sending it to cooler climate so that it could survive naah she figured saved white dragon runt last week let this one burn here in hell rap on her front door rudely interrupted her train of thought come in she grumbled peter perfect flung open the fiveton mithral door suddenly tiamat breathed with all five of her heads at once and peter got hit with cone of frost which bounced off his invulnerable coat of arnd bolt of lightning which bounced off his coat of arnd stream of acid which bounced off his coat of arnd cloud of chlorine gas which bounced off his necklace of adaptation and cone of fire which bounced off his cup and talisman of al akbar what do you want all five of tiamat heads requested at once do you always breathe first and ask questions later of course her red and white heads replied it keeps out the doortodoor salesmen tiamat let me get right to the point ohhh please doooooooo her black head said acidly need some help taking revenge on the antidisgusting characters and what in it for me her white head asked coldly if right your life that pretty serious threat her red head growled hotly do you seriously think that those new sick kids sick sword and ringman have are going to just let you crank out evil dragons in peace more likely they re going to try to hack your brains out right here in your lair and if they re anything like their mother they ll succeed see your point her blue head agreed and there was spark to its voice so what do we do peter inquired we do nt do anything the five heads said in unison you would nt stand chance against sick sword oneonone in fact neither would but can destroy her and her family she inhaled through treachery she and her consort ringman have recently split up but he does not realize that she is pregnant with yet third child boy shall plant the seed of evil within sick sword womb without father to guide him and with his mother pushing him towards disgustingcharacterlike power he will easily fall prey to becoming exactly what she despises okay great peter perfect agreed but how are you going to plant this seed of evil in her womb her green head said not and then the other four heads kicked back in you are peter folded his arms phhh oh right just going to walk over to her with packet of seeds and stuff them up her birth canal without her objecting the chromatic dragon only smiled evilly her blue head do you have potion of polymorph self in permanent effect on you of course do good sick sword felt despondent why should she she thought what did she need that paladin for anyway anybody who said she should nt raise her kids to be tough and successful deserved to be thrown out maybe she just needed somebody else to go to bed with yeah that must be it she just had to get laid she set disgusting sword and ridiculous sword down theyd know how to take care of themselves put on her most arousing skintight suit and teleported into town just outside the saloon hey sick sword echoed someone voice as she walked through the swinging doors then another hey sick sword how ya doin sick sword everybody turned around and said sick sword smiled wanly and started checking out the meat she knew most of these guys so well she could nt stomach the idea of propositioning them there was one newcomer who caught her eye though and she decided to try him you re new around here are nt you she sidled up to him the stranger azure eyes looked straight at her there was nervousness about them that he kept carefully hidden yes as matter of fact this is the first time ve been out in over year paladin really she said uh hold on just moment she turned around made some barelynoticeable gestures took pinch of something out of pouch and mumbled some phrases in latin the stranger cupped one hand to his ear and listened he recognized the incantation she was casting detect lie spell he would have to be very careful about what he said to her from then on fortytwo seconds later she whirled back around and asked say that again you mean that paladin in her mind green light blinked over the stranger head he was telling the truth how interesting like paladins what your name the stranger eyes rolled up into his head for split second then he decided call me slim he was nt very slim he was quite brawny as matter of fact but she let it slide okay slim she stuck out her right hand sick sword yes know he took her hand and kissed it ve heard much about you mlady sick sword took her right hand back with coquettish smile you re cute you know that slim smiled and raised his eyebrows yes do youre not so badlooking yourself either hey sam the bar frequenter said to the bartender wouldja lookit sick sword put the moves on that guy the bartender shook his head know jeez but do nt she and ringman well ya never can tell these days so sick sword winked at her pickup you wan na split this joint and come up to my keep mmmm sounds like fun he winked back thank goodness this guy does nt scare as easily as most of them do she thought so are you going to use any of those special powers of yours and teleport us there or as matter of fact boink yes am slim looked around and took his bearings considering the large bed dominating the scene this was probably her bedroom this girl did nt waste any time he felt even more nervous than before now that he was in her home court he had no armor weapons psionic powers or charms if she decided to take her troubles out on him now she stripped herself down to her bare 18 charisma skin right in front of him he would have come in his pants were his charisma not the epitome of perfection to match he slowly unbuttoned his shirt exposing the beefy chest within sick sword could nt restrain herself any longer and took off his clothes for him in 150 permanentpotionofspeeded flash they did nt even bother to get beneath the sheets mmmm you re not bad kiddo sick sword cooed into his ear after the exciting part was over where did you say you were from did nt say where was from slim told her hope did nt get you oh do nt worry about that already pregnant oh slim said trying to act surprised um meant hope did nt give you any well you re immune to diseases anyway being paladin and all and even if you are carrying something ve always got my periapt of health oh glad to hear it well well um uh guess ll see you later then uh yeah guess ll see you later too they got up and got dressed at opposite ends of the room if anything sick sword felt worse gbye slim said and walked out the front door hmm she figured guess he did nt need ride back slim did nt need ride back certainly not his warhorse was parked just beyond the edge of the clearing he was now exiting as matter of fact he could see the plate barding through the trees whew he told his horse glad that over with she coulda gotten suspicious at any second neeeigh the horse replied yeah know what you mean he pulled the finelytooled chain shirt out from one of the saddlebags of holding and put it on by the time he drawn the coat of mail completely down over his torso his features had changed his hair was blond his lower jaw jutted eversoslightly more forward his cheekbones were slightly wider and his voice was more firmly in the baritone range he put on weapon belt and drew its green glowing sword well prometheus he said to the sword at least got laid even if that was nt my own sperm injected into her womb ringman only heard about his son gross sword through the grapevine after living with his lady love for eighteen months here he was right back in his old cottage in town of course his cottage was actually small castle but without sick sword in it it was hardly keep he never managed to get back to the way things were before peter perfect and the disgusting characters had come along he would ve started drinking were he not concerned about keeping his paladinhood so he had third kid and he probably never see him hed come back to sick sword keep once all right for the sake of seeing his daughters if not her but she only tossed him out with an even louder get out than before the glimpse hed gotten of her face before she slammed the door looked more like omnion than it did like her the next thing he knew sick sword had moved her keep several leagues away back to where shed first drawn it from the deck he had nt seen or heard from her since well paladin operated best as solo player anyway at least that was how he tried to reassure himself he picked volume up from one of his shelves and flipped to the page he had marked his doomed relationship had nt been total loss she had taught him how to read disgusting sword reached her first level of druidicism at age 10 12 again she was slow developer but she could still make it sick sword took her to the edge of centaurs lair and pointed inside that centaur lair she told her daughter know disgusting sword replied good and you know what to do of course disgusting sword activated her permanent potion of flying at 150 effectiveness and wafted into the shallow cave one psionic blast and several clatterings of gems later she emerged as 15th level druid 17th level monk an 18th level thief 21st level paladin 31st level illusionist 38th level cleric 49th level magicuser and 58th level weapons mistress well she said to sick sword making sure all 533 of her hit points were in place that was easy how long before my magic sword becomes an artifact ridiculous sword was little smarter the only reasons disgusting sword had taken those particular levels of development was so that each of her classes would be of higher level than the one before it reading between the lines on the rules ridiculous sword figured that it did nt matter what order her levels were stacked in so long as the last class she chose had the highest experience level as the bard class could nt be started with lawfulgood alignment she would need that rules assumption if she were to become both 20th level paladin and 23rd level bard without losing her paladinhood and so hitting the centaur pits on her tenth birthday only one day after her sister did ridiculous sword emerged as 23rd level druid 15th level assassin 17th level monk 17th level ranger 17th level thief 23rd level bard 20th level paladin 31st level illusionist 38th level cleric 49th level magicuser and 60th level weapons mistress she would have gone farther in that last class had not the dungeon master set the maximum halfpointperlevel damage bonus for weapons masters at 30 points and she did nt stop at just one artifact weapon like her sister did either no sirree no one ridiculous sword for ridiculous sword she had the ridiculous hand axe holy vorpal defender frostbrand flametongue sun luckblade of wounding dancing life stealing disruption slaying everything as in the arrows of the same name throwing thunderbolts red blue green black white brass copper dragon slaying speed final word and nine lives stealing with maximum intelligence eight special purposes and enough artifact powers to leave her set for life including weapon damage is hit points taken five times sure disgusting sword practically had one of those but she also had the ridiculous broadsword which did almost everything the ridiculous hand axe did except allow her to cause serious wounds by touch and she had the nearlyidentical ridiculous dagger and ridiculous longsword both to boost her weapon damage by 20 points and to serve in melee if she had to fight for more than four minutes and got to loose the other two weapons to dance and in case she got totally unarmed she also had the ridiculous pair of gloves although it seemed kind of strange to combine the gauntlets of ogre power effect with holy vorpal pair of gloves of wounding and all the rest and she had the other ridiculous pair of gloves in case her first pair got to fight for more than four minutes and could be loosed to dance and as if that were nt disgusting enough she topped it off with the granddaddy of all artifacts the bracer of irresistible damage no sentience no ego just immunity to all forms of mental psionic heatina20footradius and cold attacks and the ability to cast first second third and fourthlevel spells simultaneously and the weapon damage is hit points major benign power taken 100 times then came gross sword turn the lad was younger than his sisters bare nine years old and sick sword had felt uneasy about her third child all along the way but she felt obliged and was determined to prove to herself that she did nt need that old paladin ringman to bring up her kids as deitylevel psionic magical powerhouses that could really take care of themselves in the outside world and so when gross sword whack at the centaurs came he was ready although not quite the kind of ready that sick sword had hoped he found the cave jumped in and hit all the centaurs in the room with psionic blast just like sick sword had told him to that stunned most of them and put the rest of them in coma he collected the sixty million gold pieces worth of milliongoldpiece gems just like sick sword had told him to and he systematically killed every centaur in the room without telling sick sword or anybody he emerged into daylight and immediately began spending his experience points just as his sisters had he progressed until he was twentythird level druid then switched and became fifteenth level assassin then seventeenth level monk and then on to rangerhood well not quite on to rangerhood and that made sick sword feel really uneasy what he chose instead was to become an anti ranger so that he would nt once have to shift his alignment away from evil have created monster sick sword thought no no overreacting gross sword knows what he doing sure his alignment does nt really mean that much does it after all the intercontinental union of disgusting characters had all sorts of different alignments in it and they got along just fine and up through the 17th level of antirangerdom to the 17th level as thief to the 23rd level as bard and then and then he became an antipaladin all the way out to the 20th level but still sick sword held firm this was her son for crying out loud she could nt just send him to his room for something so trivial as an alignment choice now could she naw of course not and besides his becoming an antipaladin would allow him to keep all the benefits of being an antiranger yeah that must be why he did it yeah yeah sure gross sword kept that chaoticevil alignment of his anti paladinhood all through his being 31st level illusionist 38th level cleric 49th level magicuser and 60th level weapons master it would be stupid to change alignments now he have to sacrifice both his antirangerhood and his anti paladinhood if he did sick sword knew that and she wasnt about to change him into anything less powerful than he already was and like ridiculous sword gross sword bought four hundred of each type of pearl of power so that he could cast 426 of each level of magicuser spell every day and created seven magic artifacts for himself the gross dagger the gross broadsword the gross longsword the gross hand axe the gross pair of gloves the other gross pair of gloves and the other bracer of irresistible damage it did nt take long for all three of them to probability travel through few dozen spheres of annihilation and gain every major and minor psionic discipline either but every disgusting character had done that at one time or another every disgusting character sick sword thought in horror no no they re not disgusting characters not my kids no they re antidisgusting characters just like am they must be they have to be ridiculous sword on the other hand was extremely nervous about her kid brother clamor in the streets shook ringman from his midday doze he heard cries of run for your lives my god it him and he back finally ringman thought have nt seen any action in nearly nine years he clasped himself into his suit of plate mail it still fit strapped on his shield fastened his weapons belt around his waist made sure his two rings were still in place and tramped out into the middle of town he walked barely fifty feet from his door when he stopped dead in his tracks he recognized the figure at the other end of the street and drew his holy avenger peter perfect ringman worked his voice into order how how did you get out peter had positioned himself so that he stood directly between ringman and the sun it made him look more impressive that way ha ha ve been out for nineandahalf years he started to approach and must say your exconcubine is really good in bed ringman gasped sick sword what have you done to her nothing ringman nothing at all nothing she did nt agree to anyway ringman suppressed shiver he could nt speak face it ringboy you re ancient history and sick sword knows it and so does prometheus right right the sword in his right hand pulsed it would have smiled if magic swords could smile it been long time ringman ringman sneered at least the holy sword have now does nt want to kill everything in sight too bad prometheus sighed it does nt know what its missing oh sure it does prome peter perfect told his sword at every moment stalking closer to ringman it used to have much more lethal wielder remember ringman clenched his jaw hard they should never have let you live peter perfect he spat out the two and should never have let you live peter cursed and charged at him ringman saw the incoming flash of green he gasped raised his shield and blocked peter promethean swing with full parry pete followed up by hacking with his axe of the dwarvish lords he hit ringman right shoulder but not hard enough to sever the arm that is he did nt roll an 18 19 or 20 of course peter perfect causeseriouswoundsbytouch ability did nt help ringman much but at least he saved against contact paralyzation as he clutched the wound with his shield arm peter perfect kicked his groin with an adamantitetipped boot as hard as he could even ringman plate mail couldnt dissipate all the impact strength of blow like that he shrieked involuntarily and was stunned peter perfect straddled him nasty smirk across his face he reached down and tore the shield from ringman left arm then reached out once more for his downed opponent holy avenger panicking himself back to his senses ringman rolled aside and kept his holy sword in his own right hand think you re pretty tough do you paladin pete scorned you all thought the dungeon was pretty tough too did nt you so tough that none of you even came back to see if escaped but did escape bwa ha ha and got back all my magic items and artifacts and certain invulnerable coat as bonus and bought few scrolls and with the help of prometheus here managed to recast all my permanent spells including protection from good ringman wondered why he was incapable of moving during this ego trip peter perfect was on he thought it was some special power but then dismissed that since he did nt see any magic twinkles he thought it may have been some obscure rule about getting to make unlimited soliloquies in combat then he remembered that it was just the fact that one exchange of blows in melee combat took whole minute and furthermore pete continued struck up deal with tiamat tiamat ringman gulped as in the chromatic dragon no as in the lady across the street of course the chromatic dragon geez you never were very intelligent were you in any case thanks to tiamat seed of evil your son is now precisely what you and your exbedpartner wanted him not to be you struck bargain with tiamat for some seed of evil and you re still paladin hey the ends justify the means ringo it was my pleasure to thrust tiamat seeds into sick sword womb ringman lay there dumbfounded why do you think did it with that bitch in the first place things could nt have been much worse ringman figured he had to get out of this disadvantaged position though before he could think of what to do next he put his right thumb and index finger in his mouth and whistled string of three notes what are you doing peter perfect demanded whistling ringman told him know that but for what peter perfect clutched his medallion of esp and aimed it at ringman cranium unfortunately he rolled he whacked the medallion in disgust stupid newfangled piece of junk ca nt even count on it to work right just then horse galloped silently into view on cushion of air peter perfect recognized it instantly from its plate barding it was ringman warhorse he stood out in front of it between the horse and ringman and punched the horse across its meteoritesteelplated jaw as hard as he could the animal rolled with the punch onto the ground some twenty feet back in the mean time ringman had recovered his shield peter perfect sneered at ringman for daring to try something so dirty and underhanded while claiming to be paladin savor death insignificant flesh slug he hacked down with his axe of the dwarvish lords this time slashing ringman right shoulder cleanly enough to sever his right arm ringman screamed with pain now shocked out of his stunned condition the arm socket gushed blood but it would stop before he ran out he let go of the top strap of his shield and grabbed his severed arm which still held his holy sword with his remaining hand the shield flopped uselessly from his elbow as he scrambled for his horse hah peter perfect called after ringman shaking his dwarvish hand axe in his left hand and inadvertently switching it to battleaxe length let see you fight without your writing arm ringman made it to his horse and tried to mount up he had to hold the arm between his chin and his chest to get on you re wimp ringman onearmed wimp stowing the right arm between his legs he grabbed the reigns in his left hand and giddyapped out of there he was grateful for those horseshoeofthezephyr shock absorbers any jostles could have sent him tumbling ringman has no writing arm ringman has no writing arm and he got chaoticevil disgusting character for son peter chided him first stop clerasil place ringman thought as his horse accelerated he ll probably be able to reconnect my writing arm well peter perfect at least it is writing arm now what selfimprovements have you made during lo these past years knock knock knock who is it it ringman bit surprised clerasil got up from his desk and went to the tremendous gothic double doors the man on the other side of it had plate mail beard and severed right arm my right arm been cut off ringman said just in case clerasil had nt noticed my word clerasil inspected the limb that does look rather nasty er come in come in ringman came in tell me who did this to you ringman stared at the ground peter perfect clerasil gasped the disgusting paladin he escaped but how he did nt say how only that he been out for nine years or so clerasil seemed to be in mild state of shock well uh it true that we stopped visiting him after while er we got tired of ragging on him but escaped dont unders wait minute that right we stored all their magic weapons in vault two levels below the dungeon he could have made telepathic contact with his holy sword and had it hack its way up to him so in other words you did nt even bother to eliminate his psionic powers oh yes we did we were very careful about that it just so happens that his sword has its own powers of telepathy that we could nt touch ringman put hand to his chin oh yeah that right prometheus was telepathic guess prome just did nt want to be telepathic with me clerasil changed the subject let reconnect that arm of yours shall we ringman had practically forgotten about it oh uh sure sure clerasil exposed the severed flesh on the end of the arm and pressed it up next to the stump on ringman shoulder ringman had thoughtfully tied tourniquet over the open end of his stump you know you re lucky you re paladin here your disease resistance let you get away with this without getting gangrene ringman folded his arm and then you have to cast cure disease spell on me right clerasil did nt reply he merely opened the tourniquet and let little bits of blood leak through to the severed limb he sprinkled holy water on it and began to chant ooom shalagoom shak shak qui tolis veal pecata mundi et in unum dominos pizza pluribus uranium semper ubi sub ubi by the power of god iii command this limb regenerated the mighty hand of god iii stretched its fingers through clerasil body and touched ringman shoulder with its awesome pinky he could start to feel sensations in his arm almost immediately and within minute the limb was whole again he moved the joint and flexed the arm bit uh thanks ringman said and since you re paladin and have had to give away all your excess wealth clerasil said gon na let you keep that regenerated limb for the low low price of only 15 000 gold pieces ringman scowled at him that the usual price and besides gave all but little under 300 gold pieces away to some amorphous lawfulgood institution long ago hmmm well considering how crucial role you played in vanquishing omnion way back when ll let you have it on the house now good day clerasil indicated the front door of his church and turned back to his desk um ringman umed yes yes what is it now clerasil kept his back turned to him ringman exhaled peter perfect out and no match for him and suppose you want me to just go charging out there and bring him back to justice right sorry no sale he already done plenty of damage yeah saw your arm now go away that not all he made pact with tiamat clerasil dropped his writing utensils and froze tiamat the chromatic dragon ringman chuckled recalling his own reaction yes tiamat the chromatic dragon the hellbound spawn of all evil dragonkind apparently he and tiamat um implanted some seed of evil in my third child before he was born and now he chaoticevil genociding machine at least twice as powerful as his mother or at least he has the potential to be one now know out of my league sick sword herself could have creamed me if she been so inclined any kid more powerful than her could stomp me into little grease spot before had chance to cast spell sorry uh you could try asking wierd dough though knock knock knock come in ringman opened the door and stepped into just about the biggest magical pyrotechnics display he seen sparks showered off the walls in all directions jugglers juggled without using their hands people whose faces were glued to instruction manuals cast burning hands spells without looking where they were pointing several graduatelevel pranksters doubtlessly from one of the halfelven fraternities were casting fireball and cone of cone spells at the same time annihilating each others effects mere milliseconds before disaster would have struck and this was just wierd dough magic college anteroom ah whom may say is calling asked thirdlevel apprentice who was seemingly unaware of the din going on around him ringman ringman lessee ringman ringman ringman that ringman with an uh yes ringman one word ring ringfield ringling ringworm nope sorry no ringman on my appointment list here look this is important have to see wierd dough it matter of life and death the conjurer apprentice stared at him coldly the chancellor sees no one without an appointment ringman opened his mouth to speak but stray lightning bolt startled him and he had to begin again just tell wierd dough that ringman is here to see him he ll know who am the apprentice shook his head what level are you anyway ninth oh and suppose you think you can push everybody around just because you re sorcerer well listen here bud not sorcerer ringman folded his arms impatiently paladin the apprentice mouthed the word paladin and then evidently something snapped and it all made sense ringman the paladin ringman the paladin the spell casting going on through the room stopped in mid syllable everybody dropped what they were doing and looked ringman the paladin the apprentice gawked the same ringman the paladin who defeated omnion in the final battle of the iudc at crysglass lake yes the same ringman the paladin boy for character class whose prime requisite is supposed to be intelligence you can sure be welcome to wierd dough college of magic ringman wont you have seat make yourself comfortable can get you glass of no no no he was still impatient have to see wierd dough it matter of life and death whose yours or his everybody now just tad more nervous the apprentice ducked behind curtain and shouted to the next rung in the chain of command ringman could just barely hear the ringman wants to see wierd dough and the not the ringman issuing from beyond twentyfour seconds later everything spun around and suddenly he was elsewhere he was in very dimly lit elsewhere as matter of fact in the center of this dimly lit elsewhere was robed figure who illuminated his bearded face by holding handful of magic flame up to it welcome the firelit face said in haunting tone what can do for you can the theatrics wierd dough this is serious oh all right the figure acquiesced and switched on the light spells by snapping his fingers you sure know how to spoil other people fun peter perfect escaped from the dungeon nine years ago wierd dough rubbed his chin in thought hmmph wouldnt put it beyond him he probably made telepathic contact with prometheus and had the sword hack its way up through two levels then grabbed on to it and worked his way down to the magic items chamber took his own stuff and the invulnerable coat of arnd as souvenir rode his warhorse out of the complex and sought revenge against the lot of us pity we stopped going there to make funny faces at him or we would ve found out you knew about how he made his escape all the time ringman stammered you mean my guess was right yes your guess was exactly right why did nt you think of it before wierd dough shrugged just never wondered about it before anyway he could nt have done much or we would ve heard about it he has done quite bit but it the type of stuff you dont hear about until it too late he got some seed of evil from tiamat and implanted it in sick sword womb while she was pregnant with my third child gross sword wierd dough grinned the old sexualimplantationofthe deityspawnedseedofalignmentdeterminationinawombthathas anunbornchildinit bit eh tried that once myself nothing much happened though yeah well something happened this time gross sword is supposedly couple times more powerful than sick sword herself he could probably bring central earth to its knees wierd dough nodded solemnly and you want me to help you get rid of him is that it no it not you want me to help you vanquish peter perfect and then do something about gross sword sorry kiddo but know about how poor you paladins tend to be no sale you want me to pay you for ridding the world of those menaces sure running college of magic is expensive stuff you could rob centaurs if you wanted money weird dough looked up at the ceiling whose distance was distorted so that it appeared feet above the floor true but then would nt be able to complain about how low we are on funds over here how would it look to all the other colleges if mine did nt desperately need more money do nt you feel the least bit indebted to me for having gotten rid of omnion indebted for how much you participated in that campaign sure am ll cast polymorph others spell on you at no cost if you want it but going back into action again is another matter entirely you re better off trying middle monk at least his profession involves constant fighting the instant ringman stepped on the welcome mat in front of the monastery fifteenfootdiameter gong sounded on its own and chinese movie music issued from enchanted loudspeakers one of the lesser disciples approached the front gate and bowed greeting the man in the plate mail gleetings most honolable lingman the paradin wercome to our humbre monastely how may we assist you need to see middle monk he told him it matter of rife and death it always is wouldnt berieve you if you wele nt who you are forrow me never unclasping his hands the disciple led ringman in through complicated maze of hanging gardens beneath row of paper lanterns past some statues with unpronounceable monosyllabic names and past paper sliding door into the main training room ringman was little worried about the security of this place until he noticed that the paper walls were made of adamantitewoven paper three rows of monks each wearing white bathrobe and different colored sash were going through training exercise ichi the one up in front shouted they all stepped forward and thrust their right fists into imaginary opponents ni he shouted again and they did the same with their left fists san came the shout and the punch again chi issued the cry and its consequent fourth time go this time the three rows yelled as they stepped forward and punched middle monk the one at the front of the group wearing black belt with several victory notches carved in it caught ringman out of the corner of his eye realizing who it was he dismissed his students with an impulsive yasumeh and walked like slob up to the man in armor ringman ol buddy middle monk slapped him on the back with his full titan strength being monk his strength did no extra damage but it sure toppled the paladin long time no see whatcha been up to can get you coke or pepsi uh coke pepsi um are those some oriental uh no no never mind so he began to walk alongside ringman what brings ya to these parts wan na be monk and be easier to hit than firstlevel illusionist or do ya just need new magic bo stick no it bit more serious than that peter perfect escaped no really wow that intense he wanted to go surfing right he escaped nine years ago middle monk stopped bantering for few seconds which was about the longest time he could be relied upon to be banter proof then well that cat probably would ve gotten out some time anyway not much trouble he can cause oh no he made bargain with tiamat so that my son gross sword is just as chaotic and evil as my two daughters are lawful and good and my blacksheep son is more powerful than anything that come before he could take on the entire iudc and win if they were still around including omnion including omnion oh middle monk grimaced bit wow gee awesome tubular cosmic like what he done so far nothing that aware of but at any moment he could decide to kill bahamut or something thought weird dough killed bahamut for the experience points middle said then recalled oh yeah that right that was only bahamut android programmed to act like him in every detail both that damned peter perfect and my multipledeity powered son are running around loose and there no way can deal with them on my own mmmm so you want me to help catch your drift um do nt think that such hot idea what with my armor class being higher than negative 17 and all mean one hit and that kid of yours could do uh how much damage did you say he could do in one blow did nt say but from what ve heard over three hundred points times five if he hits you from the rear yeeesh only have 104 hit points myself um take care of yourself man but ve got my temple to attend to why dont you try wierd dough already tried him hmmm then cleras no that cleric would nt get involved for all the holy water in the specific ocean yes know ringman added coldly then your best bet is koenieg the great druid he lives in the great big forest surrounded by some large menhirs er standing stones that are supposed to predict eclipses and things ringman could have sworn he gotten the address right he was in the great big forest leagues north of the really huge falls twelve furlongs east of the vastly hugely mindbogglingly wide river standing right in front of the ring of large menhirs he should have seen some druidic activity by now it was then that the bottom fell out of the universe beneath him screaming he fell in direction that was the fifth dimensional equivalent of down and landed five feet away from the center of the ring of large menhirs from this angle he could easily see the nine initiates of the 9th circle mulling about and koenieg the great druid seated in lotus position at the center oh get it ringman commented can only see you from inside the menhir ring naw one of the 11thlevel initiates told him that ring of stones out there in the great big forest is just decoy the ring you re in now is in parallel universe it keeps the salesmen out wave of mistletoe from the center caught ringmans attention koenieg addressed him welcome ringman to the tree of the universe ringman did nt see any trees around but he had more pressing matters to worry about here to enlist my help in vanquishing the escaped peter perfect and your blacksheep son yes know middle monk sent me telepagram believe his words were watch out for this one he looloo ringman exhaled well that was his answer whats yours koenieg went off into alpha state for few milliseconds then came back with no why not ringman asked even though he knew it was futile to try and talk 14thlevel druid out of anything the tree of the universe spreads like golden path upon the wellspring of life he who can pick its fruits and not be cast down the dark pit will know ultimate wisdom if buddha tripped and fell while nobody else was around would he make sound he who always finds fault in his friends has faulty friends penny saved is penny earned bird in the hand is worth two in the bush stitch in time saves okay okay get the message sheish he looked out through the menhirs and saw only swirling darkness uh can get back to the prime material plane now certainly just click your heels together three times and say there no place like home there no place like home burying his face in his hands ringman grudgingly tapped the heels of his high hard boots together and meekly chanted there no place like home there no place like home and while ringman had his eyes closed koenieg cast some obscure plane transport spell on him so that he would think hed gone back to central earth under his own power of course ringman was nt that stupid but he was glad to be back on central earth again well sortof glad oh all right he could barely stomach the thought of living on the same planet with peter perfect and his killing machine son and he had nt even seen his killing machine son yet yep ringman told his warhorse as he mounted up to ride off there no place like home clerasil had refused to help wierd dough had refused to help middle monk had refused to help even koenieg the great druid had declined his services the only antidisgusting character left was melnic the loud and that bard would almost certainly not get involved the instant he stepped on the welcome mat in front of melnic ollamh college he realized it was telepad that was because everything around him had suddenly congealed and deposited him in the middle of the college courtyard he found himself surrounded by raucous noisy semidrunk ollamh bards some pure human and some halfelven who upon his arrival began strumming away at their lutes few had genuine anstruth or ollamh harps and singing welcome ringman to our fancypants abode ringman the paladin whose tale is still told of how he vanquished omnion to the realm of burning cold ringman ringman are nt you getting too old uh hi guys ringman said wanly yaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy melnic the loud emerged from the middle of the crowd strummed his ollamh banjo shifted his recorder of yecind into overdrive and sang fast little ditty that sounded very much like haydn minor symphony except that haydn had nt been invented yet from days of long ago legend down to us has come or maybe it was wierd dough mind that this message comes from is said that peter perfect had escaped his cell of late and went to hell to make pact with tiamat the great and from his loins an evil seed in sick sword he did spray to make an evil child nine years ago this very day and now he tough so all we ll say is singing singing singing singing yeeeeees we are and all the other bards joined in and repeated the refrain and now he tough so all we ll say is singing singing singing singing yeeeeees we are strum strudummmmmm ringman rolled his eyes up into his head that last line did nt even fit in the context of the song we know that last line does nt fit within the context of the song melnic the loud admitted in recitative but its tradition well for one thing he did nt make that child did gross sword is my son just as much as he is sick sword peter perfect only sprayed little tiamatish evilness onto him bit later ooooooooooooooohhhhhhh everybody sang so you probably already know that need to enlist some help ca nt stop peter perfect and gross sword on my own melnic the loud will you well er um that is uh ve got this college to run see ringman folded his arms and shook his head so did wierd dough good then you ll understand know why you re declining ringman said but dont think ll ever understand ringman turned his back to melnic and started to walk away then noticed all the 20th level ollamh bards around him any of you bards want to help me grumble grumble grumble grumble they grumbled suddenly becoming concerned about their studies ringman walked slowly toward the telepad marked main exit at one side of the courtyard this had been his last shot there was no one else he could turn to oh well he tried to console himself ve had to go it on my own before gross sword scratched few dark magic symbols into the ground around sick sword keep clearing he could nt stand his sickening mother or his two goodygoody sisters he had tried to wish them away once before but they all made their saving throws and wish spell probably would have sent him away instead anyway luckily they had nt found out about that so they did nt vent any retribution upon him he spied squirrel scurrying up nearby tree he hated squirrels they were so cute and cuddly he wanted to throw up he took out his gross hand axe whirled it around as though it were 5ton war hammer and let fly at the critter the squirrel was instantly felled frozen burnt wounded dismembered poisoned leveldrained hacked to bits and finally stunned by the axe clap of thunder sick sword would doubtlessly hear the noise just like she always did that bitch gross sword called his mother voice from within the keep are you killing squirrels again yes mother he replied how many times have told you not to do that fiftyseven counting now he called back god iv how he hated sick sword well do nt do it again how do you ever expect to make it on central earth if you just go around killing things indiscriminantly gross sword shook with rage all right mother thats it he opened up one of his portable holes and took out tubeful of disappearing dust he spread the dust over his entire body in the blink of an eye and was gone from sight youre dead mother do you hear me you re dead youredeadyouredeadyouredead echoed his cry from every distant mountain disgusting sword and ridiculous sword looked up in alarm that it ridiculous sword commented he making his move come on we better stop him their helms of teleportation glowed purple for moment and they emerged at their mother keep two leagues away the town heard the thunderous cry as well ringman from the top precipice of his house which was actually small castle heard the thunder words and knew who the voice had to belong to these were the first words he ever heard his son say and they frightened him down to his kidneys after all she done to him he still loved sick sword deeply and now his tiamatinfected son was about to kill her and there was nt damned thing he could do about it except dash for his warhorse and ride like lightning to sick sword keep that is sick sword zipped over to her portal spell er window and saw the dustofdisappearancecovered killer urchin trodding through the front drawbridge of the keep at rather alarming 40 feet per second the old coveryourselfwithdustof disappearanceandcastalightspelldirectlyonsickswords robeofeyestoblinditforonetothreeminutessothateven herpermanentdetectinvisibilityspellcantseeyouandyou cansneakuponherfrombehindandbackstabherforquintuple damage trick omnion had tried that on her twice before and had succeeded the first time and nearly succeeded the second sick sword knew what to do all she had to do was spray him with dust of appearance when he first showed up now where had she put her dust tubes the sword sisters arrived just in time to see their evil brother dart into the keep covered in dust of disappearance they both knew this maneuver well it was the only known way of handling really disgusting character without even having to use esp on each other they rushed in after him ringman rode hard and fast very fast he equipped his warhorse with horseshoes of speed and secured them in place with an outer layer of horseshoes of the zephyr his horse could move at double speed without tiring and for some reason right now it was going two feet per second faster than that that would get him there in time he assured himself of course it would with flick of his middle finger gross sword knocked down the solid adamantite door to sick sword room his mother was ready for him she uncapped her tube of appearing dust and blew at her son through the other end that would have worked perfectly had not gross sword also been prepared for the last fifteen seconds he been chanting gesticulating and fiddling with legume seed behind that locked door and now having carefully integrated the flickingdownthe door maneuver into his somatic components he released his spell blowing the spoilsport dust right back to its owner with strong gust of wind and since his artifact bracer allowed him to cast simultaneous spells he followed that gust of wind up with light spell thrown directly on sick sword robe of eyes disgusting sword and ridiculous sword had clear line of sight from the splintered drawbridge through the knockeddown adamantite bedroom door to their blinded mother and her unseen adversary he succeeded she did nt manage to coat him with dust of appearance in time get out of there mom disgusting sword and ridiculous sword shouted as they charged across the foyer teleport ringman could see the edge of the clearing through trees blurred by speed within that clearing lay the unmistakable silhouette of her keep this was not the same clearing theyd lived in together it was instead where the keep had first materialized but it may as well have been there were hundreds of bushes trees and leaf piles that could hide sick sword and gross sword if they were nt inside the keep only because that terrifying you re dead sounded like it had come from this particular spot did he ride here at all he changed course eversoslightly and headed for the keep he could only hope that they were in fact in there my own son sick sword thought how could have misled myself this far she did nt teleport she did nt look from side to side in panic she did nt try to find another container of dust of appearance she did nt even pick up her sick sword from the far wall she just stood there and regretted her fate the bitch always was pushover gross sword thought and rammed his gross dagger through her heart from behind disgusting sword and ridiculous sword both saw the phantom form impale their mother they both cringed in horror as she convulsed and fell over dead disgusting sword involuntarily dropped her disgusting longsword which clanked noisily against the stone floor as gross sword shook off the disappearing faerie dust he trumpeted an evil victorious chortle that sent shivers though both the stillapproaching ringman and his horse he was still chortling when he left the prime material plane six seconds later my god ii disgusting sword cried as she knelt beside her dead mother he was nt supposed to get this far her fists clenched as her throat tightened up and wavered we were supposed to stop him first ridiculous sword nervously looked at disgusting sword then at sick sword body then at gross sword footprints in pile of invisible dust he just shaken off then back at sick swords body then back at gross sword footprints going after him she resolved but how will you know where he is disgusting sword demanded there only one place he could have gone ridiculous sword replied what the matter have you forgotten standard evil operating procedure number twentysix after an evil person kills someone who lawfulgood he or she goes to heaven to permanently destroy the soul disgusting sword just stared back at her and continued breathing hard well do nt just stand there start raise dead spell on her oh she blurted oh yeah she took out whitewith bluestriped generic holy symbol and began chanting and gesticulating only hope can reach him in time ridiculous sword mumbled flicked the switch or her amulet of the planes and went to heaven ringman doubleparked his horse by the keep entrance jumped off and rushed in through the door without his bulky adamantitealloyed plate mail to hinder him he could run whole faster he saw disgusting sword kneeling over sick swords body chanting nowalltoofamiliar raise dead spell gasped and continued to rush forward he had been right damn it that had been gross sword deadly chortle his old love was dead he knelt beside sick sword opposite disgusting sword and drew his holy avenger solemnly lining up the point with one of the spaces between the floor stones he forced the blade three inches down into the floor the upsidedown sword now resembled cross the ancient symbol for death he clasped the grip of the longsword and reclined his forehead against his hands closing his eyes silently he prayed to his deity for sick sword survival pardon me ridiculous sword asked an angelinitiate passerby did you happen to see she noticed doublefile path of dead angels littering the yellow brick road that lead through the pearly gates oh never mind she got running start and then kicked in her artifacts with all the times she taken major benign power double movement speed on foot she multiplied her running speed by 16 32 all the way up to 64 she could now run 12 288 yards in six seconds flat tiptoeing over the dead angels at mere 6144 yardspersix seconds she reached the pearly gates she addressed the toll booth saint peter you ve got to let me in there and then she noticed that the trail of angelinitiates were nt the only casualties around here saint peter had been killed over decade ago by omnion and now even his replacement saint paul lay in desiccated heap guess do nt need his permission to enter then ridiculous sword thought and charged in after gross sword sick sword felt sickening lump of deja vu form in her stomach here she was perched on the boarding steps of trans heavenly airlines concorde sst unarmed and about to get cuisinarted by ruthless evil foe she did nt much like being in this position when omnion was bearing down on her and she certainly did nt like the idea of getting eternally wiped out by her own son she had seen this coming and had finished contact other plane spell several seconds ago in case the worst were to happen and that did nt reassure her one bit so she did the only thing she could she started psionically telekinesing gross sword and hoped that she be raised from the dead in time gross sword held up card number from the villains collection of commonly used sayings it read hah you puny mortal fool your powers of telekinesis are no match for my permanent potion of flying at twice normal strength sick sword raised her eyebrows momentarily at the idea that such card could actually be commonly used saying and continued concentrating card number was right during the first minute of concentration her teke could only reduce his flight speed by four percent she could nt teleport either teleportation involved using the astral plane for quick transit since she was dead she was bound to the plane of heaven and to that plane only she could nt leave heaven for another hundred years ridiculous sword wished she had asked somebody for directions now even if it was only some cherubimintraining she was lost every yellow brick road looked the same there was nt so much as map pointing out you are here or sign saying new angel recruits saint peter or saint paul sure could have told her where sick sword had gone yessireebob but for all her disgusting powers there was no way she could locate sick sword spirit while it still had that mind blank spell up why could nt sick sword have relied on her amulet of life protection just for today gross sword drifted closer by the millisecond sick sword was doomed and she knew it well she might not be able to leave heaven but she could bloody well still transmit her thoughts through the contactotherplane link she opened less than minute before if she was going to be annihilated she had to round out one last thing first ringman sick sword voice echoed in ringman mind what he sat upright sick sword he glanced at disgusting sword his outburst had not disturbed her prayer ringman could feel her presence almost as much as if she were still alive he could feel the quavering fear the encroaching doom in her telepathic voice he could almost see his own son bearing down on her with his adamantite dagger and broadsword ringman you were right the voice said you were so right there is no need for disgusting characters on central earth anymore should never have turned our children into killing machines sick sword he clutched his face as he said it no no do nt let this be the end still love you with all my heart my love she replied and her voice sounded more final than ever ringman sorry so so sorry choking sensation cut across the telepathic ether and her transmission ended ringman neither spake nor moved no ridiculous sword shouted to gross sword when she at last reached the scene but too late before she could get any of her spells off before even the quickest of her psionic disciplines kicked in before there was any way she could beat him to the punch gross sword impaled his mother ghost on his gross dagger and channeled enough damage into it from his other bracer of irresistible damage to vaporize her her phantasmal form twinkled for an instant and then dispersed itself back into the cosmic ocean from whence it came disgusting sword finished her prayer pointed her right index finger at sick sword corpse neck and let her arm recoil slightly the standard raise dead spark flashed on her fingertip but it was nt echoed by the body at all disgusting sword mouth dropped open in disbelief ringman had already known for the last several seconds that it wouldnt work anyway it was all over gross sword smiled chaoticevilly at ridiculous sword guffawed hideous laugh and left the plane of heaven ridiculous sword could nt find him now unless he wanted to be found ringman buried his face in his hands and started to shake his fingertips grappled with his temples then not caring if disgusting sword or ridiculous sword or the whole town heard him he tore his hands away and screamed as loudly as he could aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah wailed the first echo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah cried the second aaaaaaaaah whispered the third the silence that followed was thunderous it took ringman long while to break down and sob the poor man disgusting sword thought it must really be hard on him part two portable hole disgusting sword read off the inventory sheet check ridiculous sword replied taking the folded piece of black hyperdimensional cloth from sick sword bureau and stowing it in trunk second portable hole check ridiculous sword did the same to this facsimile fifty containers of dust of disappearance tentwentythirtyfortyfifty check ring of earth elemental command ridiculous sword pulled the ring from sick sword finger and threw it into the trunk check ringman you sure you do nt want any of this stuff huh what ringman awoke from his stupor oh no no ve got my limit as paladin ca nt have more than four non armor nonshield nonweapon magic items you know disgusting sword shrugged we ve never gone by that stipulation you also got this way via robbing centaurs ringman noted sorry that lifestyle not for me suit yourself ring of water elemental command check the ring made ting as it landed in the trunk plus six dagger of wounding check plus six bastard sword of wounding check mace of cuthbert check hey you think one of us ought to use that disgusting sword pondered the idea they were both lawful good clerics with strengths of 18 or more after all well we ll see maybe later hammer of thunderbolts check arrow of slaying lawfulevil halfelven fightermagic userthieves check plus five longbow check helm of brilliance sick sword lifeless head lolled gently up then down as ridiculous sword took its bejewelled helmet off ringman could nt bear to look anymore check helm of teleportation she took the helmet underneath the first off her head check helm of telepathy she took the third helmet off her head check amulet of life protection ridiculous sword moved to the bureau and took out charm onachain sick sword had nt needed the amulet limited psionic protection when her nowartifact sword had given her total immunity to all forms of mental or psionic attack and despite its namesake ridiculous sword reassured herself the amulet of life protection would nt have done any good against gross sword anyway check reverse eyes of petrification ridiculous sword covered the spectacles with her hand so as not to look at them check sphere of annihilation ridiculous sword calmly chucked the black ball of nothingness into the trunk check wand of negation this item she was more careful with check and the list went on and on altogether 10 magic wands 20 magic rings 150 containers of magic dust magic helmets magic pairs of gauntlets 17 magic ioun stones magic staves 13 nonartifact magic weapons and 45 other miscellaneous magic items completed the inventory of the late sick sword magic item arsenal and last but certainly not least disgusting sword finished the list the sick sword am the sick sword the sick sword bellowed as ridiculous sword grabbed it oh pipe down ridiculous sword silenced it check she was about to toss it in the trunk but she stopped herself you know this weapon right here could do lot of good in the right hands ringman are you sure you ringman backed away emphatically even if did have room for it on my inventory which most definitely do not you understand am not going to touch that sword again ridiculous sword let the sword fall and put her hands on her hips hey wait minute you have four magic weapons right yeah that right my holy sword my hand axe my bow and and arrows and my and you have one suit of magic armor and one magic shield right well yeah but was in too much of hurry to put them on when heard gross sw and what other magic items do you have well there my ring of shooting stars he counted one on his fingers my 3ina5footradius ring of protection he counted two my periapt of proof against poison he counted three and my and my my uh his voice trailed off you do nt have fourth magic item do you ridiculous sword chuckled ha you been hauling around those two magic potions for so long that you forgot when you used them that they freed up two slots on your inventory oh remembered that all right ringman defended himself it just that ve been so preoccupied with the rest of the things going on in your life you forgot about it ridiculous sword finished the sentence for him well now reminding you you can have one more magic item in your care she indicated the overflowing trunk well now your chance to pick one these things might never get used again otherwise no no could nt afraid of taking anything that once belonged to your true love ringman grimaced well yes because then you feel like vampire will you stop doing that just because you can read my mind does nt mean want you to ridiculous sword nodded solemnly sorry about that guess all the experience points in central earth would nt teach me respect anyhow disgusting sword reached into the trunk how about her old helm of brilliance already told you do nt want oh come come now it ll protect you like double strength ring of fire resistance it ll glow pale blue whenever undead are around this pale blue glow ll do 16 points of damage to the undead per minute you can produce flame at will itll turn your holy sword into holy sword of flame and you can fire up to ten prismatic sprays twenty walls of fire thirty fireballs and forty light spells ringman rubbed his fuzzy chin this magic item did seem awfully useful uh uh no no could nt really then how about this handydandy girdle of titan strength she held up the harness and added temptingly plus tohit plus 14 to damage hmmm he thought compared to the normal tohit and to damage that his 1892 strength allotted him 25 strength would certainly be an improvement he recalled how much he enjoyed being super strong after imbibing that storm giant potion for the final battle against the iudc and that only gave him 24 strength but that was only power trip he realized no no super strength for me there enough of that in central earth disgusting sword shrugged suit yourself hey then how about wand of negation one zap from this wand can instantly neutralize any magic item it pointed at 34 of the time or in the same vein rod of cancellation might do wonders for you it can instantly drain an item of all its magic powers just by touching it they would be useful against peter perfect and his ilk listen ll tell you one of the reasons reluctant to take fourth magic item is that my warhorse already has horseshoes of the zephyr and horseshoes of speed feel little guilty if and you feel little stupid if having that one extra magic item could have saved your skin the next time you clash with peter perfect ridiculous sword butted in besides did nt you used to have carpet of flying that was very long time ago got rid of that years before even met sick sword and have fast warhorse anyway hey disgusting sword resumed how about rod of lordly might does nt that count as weapon not if the dungeon master is nt looking ringman covered his eyes with his hands and shook his head her old amulet of life protection would make you immune to psionic blasts and that the only psionic attack mode that can affect you or that amulet of proof against detection and location would keep the bad guys from finding out where you were or ringman was nt listening anymore he was lost in thought that helm of brilliance sounds marvelous wearing that would be like being fire god but titan strength the ability to lift and carry 1500 pounds without even straining smash open locked doors times out of 10 successfully bend bars and lift gates 110 of the time and get to hit and 14 to damage he rolled the words around in his head plus to hit and plus 14 to damage mmmmm tohit14 damage what am saying he suddenly blurted out disgusting sword stopped rattling off item names ringman hyperventilated look ca nt get involved in any power trips no matter how tempting do nt tell me you actually think your code of paladinhood prohibits that sort of thing no no no power trips power trips got the iudc together in the first place power trips turned gross sword to chaos and evil do nt want that to keep on happening to people least of all to me he grasped his holy sword by the hilt which was still stuck pointfirst in one of the gaps between the stones in the floor and pulled it out or at least he tried to pull his sword out it wouldnt budge oh come on holy avenger we ve been through this before you re not sentient you were nt forged by wizard who looked like red pushbutton telephone receiver so stop playing that swordinthestone bit and come on out he yanked again the few inches of the blade still stuck in the masonry still refused to give maybe it likes being sick sword tombstone disgusting sword suggested we re gon na move sick sword anyway ringman said as he strained with the stubborn longsword she stink up the keep if we did nt bury her and we ca nt exactly cremate her while that permanent potion of fire resistance at 150 effectiveness is still in effect on her oh stop playing dead you stupid sword let go ringman exhaled and dropped to his knees it seemed there was only one way to get it out pretty please he pleaded with the sword the holy avenger leapt from its place in the floor into ringman right hand ringman shook his head in tired disbelief ridiculous sword eyed the holy sword warily are you sure that sword not sentient sure sure it never so much as throbbed at me for the whole time ve owned it and peter perfect said it was an ordinary holy sword lem me have it for few minutes ringman shrugged okay he handed her the sword what are you going to do she held the sword in her right hand took out scroll she had specially scribed for just such an occasion and read the runes from the page the scroll looked like it would take while to read she identifying it disgusting sword told him the identify spell itself takes ten minutes to cast but she can pick up one property of your holy sword every six seconds after that oh say what weapon do you use in your off hand you mean what in my left hand when wielding my holy sword ringman replied my shield of course no mean what do you use in your left hand when youre not using your shield oh well when peter perfect splintered my old shield had to use my magic hand axe in my left hand see and just how magic is your hand axe plus three why well you can use dagger right well yeah have so why not trade that old hand axe in for sick swords dagger of wounding ringman opened his mouth in halfstupor plus six dagger of wounding he whispered then in his normal voice hmmph it bad enough she was ever able to buy such weapon in the first place can you imagine me walking around with pure adamantite dagger that leaves unhealable wounds and you re sure you wo nt want that girdle of titan strength ringman stood up and put his hands behind his back think he mused as he strolled toward the window that would rather take in the view of the surrounding forest than wear girdle of titan strength disgusting sword glared at him out of the corner of her eye are you sure you re really our father ringman glanced solemnly over his shoulder at her and after few seconds replied are you sure you re really my kids he looked out over the fields in the lateafternoon sun for long time never so much as flinching never so much as looking back at his first daughter whom his last question had hurt it was only ridiculous sword voice ten minutes later that broke him out of his trance think ve found something she said putting the sword down she would have been quite exhausted had not that spell come from scroll instead of herself oh ringman turned toward her only halfinterested your sword has no intelligence in the usual sense of sword intellect however it is sentient in way she handed the holy avenger back to ringman confused ringman carefully took the sword in both hands he viewed it in totally different light now how is it sentient it has one special power in addition to being runof themill holy longsword runofthemill holy sword ringman thought um what power is that if you embed it in stone it wo nt come back out unless you say pretty please ringman rode rather slowly back to his own castle disgusting sword and ridiculous sword could straighten things out at his late girlfriend keep on their own his holy sword hung from his belt as it had on that hurried journey over there he had firmly decided not to take any magic items from sick sword inventory home with him so there was no helm of brilliance capping his head or girdle of titan strength circumscribing his waist however there was one charge of sick sword that he did feel obliged to look after and it sat on the saddle behind him my master gone the brownie sobbed it had taken long time for him to get over the shock of having the mental cord between himself and sick sword snap apart familiars always took while to recover from the loss of their master now his crying had subsided to gentle evening shower in the middle of the forest know how you feel ringman commented believe me know how you feel uh what your name the halfpixie dried one of his eyes with his index finger sick sword always called me the brownie she she never even asked you your name naah she was usually too busy and most of the time was astrally projected so would nt get hurt he gazed skyward then out at the forest his first home had been in forest much like this one the astral plane was an awfully drear place but at least had her thoughts to keep me company did you have name among the brownies well yeah my folks and all my friends used to call me homer before got recruited to be sick sword familiar so you left your family and friends behind then yeah but at least got this in the bargain he held up dimly glowing short sword it made of pure adamantite ringman chuckled slightly so what around here is nt did did you used to have family and friends too you mean before became paladin well yes as matter of fact did my father was mason you see in fact that was the family trade fitting and mortaring stonework of course like everyone in this culture learned the family trade too but my father knew somebody who had connections with the knights guild and that if trained hard enough could enter the service of king whatshisname the seventyfifth so went to knight school could nt you have gone in the daytime ringman grimaced that an old pun anyway made it through knight training entered the king service and eventually got selected to be one of the elite palace knights they said it had to do with certain rare qualities that were determined at birth anyhow they gave me this book to learn called the code of paladinhood only problem was that at the time could nt read so had to learn it by rote well did learn the paladins code and the instant finished reciting it before the knights guild gained all these weird powers and pretty soon got assigned to be guardian of the town still living in homer rubbed his chin for second but you still havent told me about your family and friends ringman thought for long moment he was looking down at nothing in particular maybe that because ve been trying not to remember them they rode on through the forest in silence now that was something you did nt see every day the first guard thought rarely did little boys ever visit the dungeon and even then they usually were nt wearing robes of eyes still he had his duty to uphold so he straightened his scale mail drew his broadsword hefted his shield and asked who goes there the boy grinned and parted open his robe of eyes on one side then opened the black robe of the archmagi underneath so that both guards could see the dagger sticking out of his belt sheath the tiny sliver of the blade that was exposed to sight glowed dim blue the first guard nudged the second out of his nap with his elbow the second guard rubbed his eyes to resolve the very dangerous looking little boy stalking toward them the first guard pointed his sword at the kid halt and identify yourself who are you the boy stopped four feet away from him and narrowed his eyes until he stared out of slits your worst nightmare the second guard drew his sword as the first one gasped and tightened his posture it was nt very easy to move in scale mail it was however very easy to move in robe of eyes and robe of the archmagi particularly if you happened to be 17th level monk and 60thlevel weapons master under the influence of potion of speed at double normal effectiveness the boy hand flashed out snatched the broadsword from guard number one and squeezed until the blade broke in half startled guard number two swung his sword around in crescent arc aiming for the kid left shoulder before he knew what happened the boy had drawn his dagger with his left hand sliced up through the air and cut off the guard right hand owwwwwww the guard screamed slumping to the ground and clutching his right wrist below the stump just as hard as he could it did nt stop the slow trickle of blood the first guard said some interjection in lawfulneutral and scampered away as fast as he could the second guard wasnt about to stop the youth from getting in the dungeon if he wanted in that badly he could nt have stopped him anyway that what like about being chaotic evil gross sword thought as he walked through the entrance you can do anything you want well well wild max said when he glimpsed gross sword walking into the visitors arena what have we here it boy declared rango boy wearing robe of eyes da bad dude observed and black robe of the archmagi dirk the destructive added and holding rango examined the dagger in his left hand unholy dancing frostbrand defender antisun blade of wounding sharpness throwing thunderbolts venom life stealing slaying everything contradisruption bronze dragon slaying brass dragon slaying copper dragon slaying gold dragon slaying silver dragon slaying green dragon slaying blue dragon slaying speed final word and nine lives stealing fire leapt up from the dagger hilt and consumed the blade you forgot flametongue the gross dagger complained oh how stupid of me rango said frostbrand and flametongue at the same time da bad dude wondered humph gross sword humphed hmm ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ho ho ho ho ho hardeharharhar hey wild max sneered what so funny you call yourselves disgusting characters hah spit on your feeble attempts of disgust ptooi well what do you expect dirk the destructive said defensively we ve been stripped of our magic items our psionic powers and our dignity why back in the days of the union we could do nothing your pathetic union was defeated by bunch of wimps as weak as yourselves he reached into one of his portable holes pulled out his three magic helms and stacked them on his head where they belonged why my mother could defeat your most powerful member oh yeah who your mother kid sick sword as matter of fact yes that got their attention or at least she was until today now she nothing rango shrugged well do nt look at any of us we didnt have anything to do with it not that we re sorry to see her go wild max gloated of course not killed her and evaporated her soul all four pairs of exiudcmembers eyes bugged out then slowly one by one they began applauding their boy hero gross sword bowed kiddo da bad dude said amid the mounting cheers youve just got yourself four followers for life followers gloss sword asked rhetorically he expected someone to suggest that but turned the word into question anyway for dramatic effect oh not interested in followers you four are going to bow down and worship me the cheering stopped instantly or will kill each and every one of you purple shimmer in the middle of the room broke the mood the exdisgustingcharacters all wiped their brows in relief until they saw who it was stepping out of the purple shimmer thought might find you here gross sword ridiculous sword said well sister dear gross sword smiled chaoticevilly long time no see too bad about dear old mom eh you ve killed your last prime material being gross and she might have survived too had she ever bothered to draw the fates card from deck of many things tch tch tch very calmly she said defend yourself brother and charged at him at 12 288 feetpersixseconds gross sword gross broadsword deflected ridiculous swords ridiculous hand axe with no trouble at all of course the clap of thunder that rose out of the weapontoweapon contact was bit unnerving always have gross sword replied to her last instruction this time it was ridiculous sword ridiculous broadswords turn to parry gross sword gross dagger which it did quite well with little guidance from its disgustingly accurate owner and another very loud thunder clap of course hmmm gross sword said in between sword hacks not bad for an amateur ridiculous sword glanced around at the cells around her and their terrified occupants each weapontoweapon thunderbolt probably brought them that much closer to deafness she would have to take the battle outside breaking off from the fray she ran out through the entrance doorway past the wounded guard and into the elysian fields gross sword ran out as far as the dehanded guard in the doorway then stopped gee too bad he said very loudly if you wo nt engage me guess ll just have to kill him instead ridiculous sword had to get his attention and fast gross sword sleeps with his teddy bear she teased and scampered insultingly away do not the nineyearold disgusting boy replied and besides he teddy dragonturtle he charged after her they clashed again and again their weapons sent peals of thunder echoing from the faroff peaks and neither of them got hit see gross sword said over the prevailing thunder that the dungeon master has nt retracted that old limitation requiring you to roll natural 20 to hit anyone who armor class 17 or better do nt play dumb with me ridiculous sword replied just as audibly the dungeon master let us add our tohit bonuses into those extended twenties on the attack matrices long ago our armor classes are just so good that we ca nt hit each other anyway they could nt even hit each other by surprise or from behind either as they eventually discovered their rear armor classes were 45 not counting their protections from evilgood clang clash the skirmish continued clang clang clang shink kssh kssh shunk pshank they could have knocked each other unconscious and never hit each other they were hitproof even in their sleep this was getting them nowhere this is getting us nowhere ridiculous sword commented who cares this is the most fun ve had in hours sparks flew from their weapons dusty roads and elysian fields got trampled underfoot few people and some forest creatures in the vicinity went deaf and still they had nt scratch on them neither of them dared to use any of their slay living or finger of death spells both because they easily make their saving throws and because any spells they cast at each other would set up resonating field between their rings of spell turning it was stalemate pure and simple and finally even gross sword got tired of playing this silly game tired of playing this silly game think ll go wipe out an upper or lower plane instead no ridiculous sword accidentally gasped gross sword smiled you ll see me around again on one plane or another and with that he vanished ridiculous sword let her weapons drop down by her side and retrieved her ridiculous dagger and ridiculous longsword from out of the air being weapons of dancing the dagger and longsword had been doing their part independent of her then again gross sword had been doing his part independent of her since before he was born she wished she knew what had made him go wrong she wished one of those commune spells or audiences with the dungeon master or ollamh bards would have let her in on the secret something about spraying an evil seed was all she ever picked up but first she had to warn the other planes of what might soon happen to them gross sword could attack anyplace at any time but his most likely targets would be those planes that were lawful good after all he could goad her the most by attacking saintly plane and his own alignment was diametrically opposed to law and good anyway that narrowed his choices down to the three levels of arcadia the seven heavens and the twin paradises twelve planes to choose from and gross sword could strike at any one of those well she had better get st no there was thirteenth plane she almost neglected to include the back of the east wind where bahamut palace stood the lord of all good dragons would nt his head make an excellent trophy to hang on gross sword wall that would have to be ridiculous sword first stop bahamut ridiculous sword called out there was no answer surely the one platinum dragon could hear her his palace was barely hundred yards away even if the palace was invisible to normal sight she approached bit closer and called for him again bahamut an old hermit creaked up to her from nearby brook down hill there were seven canaries flitting around his head are you looking for the platinum dragon the hermit asked oh there you are ridiculous sword said nonchalantly hi bahamut we have to talk the hermit studied her closely then gasped and bugged out his eyes it you he exclaimed and as he said this his body underwent startling transformation his neck elongated and thickened his arms and legs elongated and thickened his head elongated and thickened his torso elongated and thickened his previously nonexistent tail elongated and thickened and his skin turned from wrinkled dry tan to shining platinum within seconds the hermit was huge ancient dragon once more his canaries turned into huge ancient gold dragons too but that was what usually happened anyway ridiculous sword bahamut said quivering in awe he bowed in that way that only dragons can honored by your presence tell me what brings you to the back of the east wind came here to warn you about my brother gross hey wait minute did nt wierd dough kill you for your experience points oh phhh that was only my bahamut android programmed to act like me in every detail so what is this warning about your brother he finally flipped ridiculous sword exhaled saw it coming for long time though not sure why he said he wanted to wipe out an upper or lower plane and he fully capable of following through on that promise this place is his most likely target and so are you bahamut shook his tremendous mane and swallowed hard in that way that only huge ancient platinum dragons can and what can do to protect myself and my court ridiculous sword glanced downward wish knew and that when the air behind bahamut glowed purple for moment holy feces ridiculous sword cursed he here she drew her ridiculous hand axe and her ridiculous broadsword and ran around behind the dragon lord gross sword only smiled and sprinted in wide arc out to bahamut right side ridiculous sword followed at the same impossible breakneck speed but there was really no way she could catch up to him not unless he made mistake he seemed to be making mistake ridiculous sword noticed he seemed to be running too slowly ridiculous sword was actually catching up with him she knew he had the same set of artifact powers and the same running speed as she did their infernal balance of power insured that so then why would he run slow enough for her to close the gap it was not gross sword that had made the mistake it was ridiculous sword who had she was so intent on catching up with her brother that she did nt think that maybe he wanted her to catch up just as ridiculous sword was nearly upon him gross sword doubled back and headed for the platinum dragon at full tilt ridiculous sword cursed herself for falling into that trap leapt executed midair flip and sprinted back toward her brother and the dragon lord she had been trying to protect she was nt closing in on gross sword this time though but bahamut was nt going to take this sitting still he knew about disgusting characters armor classes so clawing and biting were out of the question besides they had far too many hit points to kill in just few blows instead he opened his cavernous maw and exhaled cloud of vapor at the boydemon charging him the seven gold dragons by his side also breathed seven cones of fire at the lightbrownhaired youth in case that might do any good if by some miracle of nature gross sword had managed to roll on 20sided die against bahamut vaporous breath he would have assumed gaseous form for two whole hours as it was though he was neither vaporized nor fried the flames all bounced off his fireproof other bracer of irresistible damage anyway he closed to terrifyingly close range with bahamut glanced over his shoulder at his sister who was only 10 yards behind him jumped whirled around in midair landed on the back of bahamut neck and poised his gross broadsword threateningly beneath the platinum dragon chin freeze he commanded ridiculous sword hesitated the dragon lord was motionless as stone one more step ridiculous sword and bahamut here gets it ridiculous sword eyed her brother warily he had already killed his own mother he was certainly capable of following through with his threat she wondered why he had nt just killed bahamut outright now throw down your weapons gross sword ordered so that his plan ridiculous sword thought make me disarm myself then he can kill me and bahamut both youd kill him anyway she said and leapt through the air toward him you re right gross sword replied would and the instant before ridiculous sword reached him he stuck his sword into bahamut throat and did 345 points of damage and that was nt even counting the life stealing slaying venom severing or disintegration effects of the weapon bahamut slumped headless to the ground gross sword liked the feeling of that so much he killed one of the seven huge ancient gold dragons as well before he used his amulet of the planes to transport him out there was nt human or gold dragon present who wasnt screaming crying or moaning ringman was unaware of what had just transpired at the back of the east wind he had his own dilemma to worry about he saw it coming the moment he parked his horse lone figure this time confidently without its own warhorse stalked slowly into town toward ringman small castle the glowing plate mail the jewelled helmet and the sheathed prometheus dangling from its side left no question as to who it was that had decided to bug them again quick homer ringman instructed the brownie to the second floor but what being one floor higher gon na do against peter perfect homer asked as he clambered up the stairs behind ringman if right the 9thlevel paladin explained as he reached the second story everything he pointed there closet marked nonmagical weapons along the south wall it it there ll be stack of things that look like javelins grab all of those javelinlooking things you can and bring them to the east parapet right homer said and got going he was too scared of peter perfect to argue ringman went to the north parapet and unlashed rather large war engine on wheels put this here to ward off attack from the north he mumbled to himself as he started to push the apparatus peter perfect would have to attack from the east he was having an acheron of time getting this thing to move on those old rotten wooden wheels he wished now that he had taken that girdle of titan strength then he could just carry this whole mess to the east parapet but he was making pretty good time anyway considering that the left wheel only turned about 13 of the time oh riiingmannn peter perfect voice echoed from faroff just as ringman finished dragging the artillery engine onto the parapet where are you ringmannn come out and plaay its that time of the month again ringman grabbed the front end of the gismo and pulled until it pointed more or less at peter perfect homer was just emerging from the hallway carrying very large armful of javelinlooking things he dropped one about every ten feet ringman nodded at the brownie then took hold of the gigantic rubber band that spanned the front of the device and stretched it across large metal tong three feet back from the apparatus front now what do do homer asked as ringman got behind the machine load one of the missiles into the firing slot just in front of that rubbery thing as soon as crank it all the way back he grasped the two levers connected to opposite sides of toothed wheel and began to turn it several gears and pulleys later the metal tong keeping the rubber band in place pulled back even farther ringman continued to crank and the rubber band continued to retract what is this thing homer asked it ballista ringman said with evident strain in his voice it was getting harder and harder to turn the crank peter perfect interrupted them again this time closer which part of your body shall cut off this time how about your left arm or leg or different extremity ringman ignored him since learned how ve been reading the book of infinite wisdom little myself he explained found this little gem in the construction and siege heading so with little help from sick sword before she threw me out of her life got hold of ballista peter perfect in for nasty surprise hey too bad about your little girlfriend ringboy peter shouted once more at least you wo nt have her ordering you around the castle to wash the dishes right homer smiled expectantly as he loaded the first spearlike missile into the firing track ringman took his seat as the firer and grabbed the handles which allowed him to aim since this was magic ballista the swivel bearings would never rust and so despite his difficulty in moving the ballista to this position its aiming mechanism worked smooth as glassteel he poised his thumb atop the right handle release switch lined up peter perfect in the builtin crosshairs and let him have it the missile streaked through the air and shattered to flinders against peter perfect chest ho ho ringman he laughed you re going to have to do better than that ringman whacked himself over the forehead would have to forget about that accursed coat of arnd he totally invulnerable from his neck down to his thighs reload for me again after crank it back going to have to aim for his legs homer shrugged sure thing uh boss ringman had already set the rubber band back on the metal flange and was hurriedly working the crank peter perfect trudged evercloser he was less than two hundred yards away now never thought that the great and powerful ringman would resort to throwing things at me homer had the ballista loaded and ringman centered peter perfect in his sights he aimed just tad lower this time putting the crosshairs on his right thigh rather than his torso and fired the rubber band tossed the projectile forward the ballista rattled backandforth the black streak of the missile lunged across the intervening distance and javelinlooking thing pierced right through peter perfect adamantitealloyed thigh guard and impaled his right leg arrrrgh peter screamed clutching at the shaft how could you possibly have hit me armor class 20 think again you poor excuse for paladin ringman shouted according to page 109 lefthand column paragraph of the book of infinite wisdom ballista targets are always considered to be ac 10 if exposed to sight armor class ten peter worried ringman had another missile loaded in less time than anyone in his right mind would think he was capable of fire he shouted this time aiming for peter right leg peter perfect saw it coming and tried to dodge his shield and dexterity were totally useless in this situation he could only hope that by not being static target he would incur some tohit penalty on ringman penalty or not the missile still hit and now peter had wooden pole sticking out of his left leg ouch peter ouched hopping from leg to leg either leg was equally painful to walk on his invulnerability had not protected him here so he figured that that blasted ringman must be using magic ballista or something he heard the sound of turning ratchet ringman was reloading again confound it and he only had 188 hit points too sure each hit only did 111 damage points to him they be doing 313 if not for his permanent protection from normal missiles spell but how long could he hold out before ringman got that lucky strike to his head he had only one alternative as far as he could tell get out of there and get out fast and so with purple glow from his second magic helmet peter perfect teleported out all right homer shouted we did it he held up his hand ringman slapped the brownie hand highfive and joined him in rejoicing yeah we did it victory for now defeat ridiculous sword said as she solemnly lowered bahamut corpse into the ceremonial dragon burial ring for now there would be no cremation no funeral pyre dragon skin was too valuable to waste two small bronze dragons and one normalsized young gold dragon lowered the slain gold dragon body down beside bahamut there were tears in all their eyes but the young gold dragon seemed ready to burst silver dragon took faltering steps towand the two and laid headstones next to them bahamut the first one read lord of all good dragons the second one read samuel of bahamut court gggoobye dad the young gold dragon wept by samuels remains then he closed his eyes and recited one of the gold dragons axioms you shall lie more peacefully that you have furthered bahamut ideal and with that nearly every one of the hundreds of metal colored dragons who had gathered there burst into tears the six huge ancient gold dragons that had been bahamut court most of all bahamut was life to each and every one of them first saint paul ridiculous sword recounted then our mom and now bahamut swear gross sword ll not rest until you ve been defeated ll find way no one is totally invulnerable not you not not anyone even if it means my own life and soul ll stop you bahamut the saurine voices around her wailed oh bahamut bahamut bahamut part three ridiculous sword pushed her way through the swinging doors of the saloon she needed drink or at least she needed some place to unwind she listened briefly to the piano player on her way from the door to the bar he was playing one of those sprightly tunes that piano players always seem to be playing in saloons sign rested on top of his tinny upright reading do nt hack me to bits only the piano player she propped herself up on barstool and smoothed the light brown hair out of her face bartender gimmie double ethanol the bartender leered at her okay kid let see some id she looked him straight in the eye id have nt been invented yet oh yeah he replied and reached below the counter for bottle of pure grain alcohol she looked at the piano player again who was repeating the same phrase he just played 20 seconds ago oh can it pianos have nt been invented yet either here ya go kid the bartender returned with glassful of ethyl alcohol uh ya do got money dontcha do have money he asks here she plopped million goldpiece gem down on the counter the bartender eyes bulged out um er uh sorry but we do nt take any denominations smaller than 20 gold pieces all right all right so what else is new she drew her ridiculous hand axe much to the dismay of the bartender and chopped the 1000000goldpiece gem up into 65536 1525878906goldpiece gems she scooped 65535 of these back into her leather backpack of holding which she placed in her portable hole and gave one to the bartender here keep the change oh and bring me two more of these will ya two more doubleethanols uh sure he set to work she lifted the glass to eye level and swished it around watching the small impurity of water make little eddies then she lowered it to her mouth for the honor of grayhawk she toasted and downed the whole glassful in single gulp it was in staring at the bottom of the tilted glass that she saw reflection of the commotion outside no the little halfelven boy screamed as he struggled to free himself do nt wanna go with you sureyoudo the female dragging his left arm replied in monotone dontyouwanttocomehomewithus no you re not my real mommy and daddy ofcourseweare the male dragging his right arm recited in monotone half an octave below the female the monotone mommy and daddy barely noticed that they had bumped into tenyearold girl when the message reached whatever passed for their brains they were quick to reprimand her getoutofourway the female said pointing her decaying elven pointy ears forward thisisnoneofyour business oh no ridiculous sword replied since when do zombie parents have live children zombies the boy gulped the two glazyeyed humans looked at each other quizzically then looked back at ridiculous sword and said in chorus weare notzombies ridiculous sword smirked we ll see about that she replied as she reached under her robe of eyes she pulled out white eggshaped thing with light blue stripe with dark blue trim across the middle that had the words holy symbol printed on the side holding it out in front of her and facing the kids parents she nonchalantly said begone and the two zombies disintegrated into piles of dust the boy just stood there and shook sorry ridiculous sword put hand on his shoulder did those ever used to be your real parents well the boy sniffed well they did look sorta like my mom and dad ridiculous sword nodded solemnly they ve probably been dead for several days there are always those prankster cults around who ll look for parents who have just died and animate them into zombies before their kids find out sorry it had to happen to you the boy began had feeling something was wrong when they went out to the town well yesterday morning and did nt come back ridiculous sword nodded again are you an only child um do nt have any brothers or sisters if that what you mean then he added used to have sister but she died of typhus ridiculous sword covered her eyes with her right hand and shook her head when are these people going to get around to inventing penicillin the boy puzzled peniwhat er never mind never mind hey what your name jimmy what yours ridiculous sword in the most phenomenal turnaround ridiculous sword had seen in long time jimmy went from the verge of sobbing to barely controllable fit of the giggles he was down on the ground in seconds ridiculous sword he managed to spit out between guffaws ridiculous sword haw haw haw haw haw haw haw that the stupidest name ever heard oh right ridiculous sword folded her arms and suppose you think jimmy is lots better name you bet haw haw haw ridiculous sword what stupid name of its own volition the broadsword stashed next to ridiculous sword left hip pulled itself free of its scabbard and dashed toward jimmy jimmy case of the giggles went away instantly the sword hovered in midair momentarily and then zipped to within an inch of his throat ridiculous sword the sword bellowed amplifying its voice with telepathy happens to be perfectly fine name there something wrong with that now now ridiculous sword ridiculous sword chided her naughty weapon do nt go threatening innocent bystanders he was talking about me anyway not you she drew her sword from the air and sheathed it jimmy shook like fault line sorry about that jimmy my ridiculous sword bit touchy you be too if you had an 82 ego your your sword named after you sure she drew some of her other weapons and so my hand axe and my longsword and my dagger and my pair of gloves and my other pair of gloves they re all just as ridiculous as am jimmy was silent for very very long fraction of second then he spoke up what do do now that my mom and dad are two piles of dust ridiculous sword shrugged well guess you re with me kiddo jimmy glared at her but you are nt any older than am no but have seventy or eighty million more experience points than you do seventy or eighty million jimmy mouthed his eyes bulging come on ridiculous sword gestured let go to your place and try to straighten out your future now that looking after you ridiculous sword explained as they walked down hackandslash lane toward jimmy old home think you ought to know that ve made some pretty powerful enemies not the least of whom is my own dear brother uh huh so so they might want to get at me through you you ll need to be able to protect yourself hey ten years old if anybody tries to mess with me why ll bash em across the jaw he swung at the empty air ll kick their butts he thrust his foot out in front of him ll you ll get killed if you try that fists and feet arent very useful against crossbow bolts jimmy gulped unless you happen to be monk like me monk but thought you were cleric no silly pure clerics ca nt use edged weapons so you re monk and cleric then ridiculous sword thought of telling him more then thought better of it yes am oh they resumed walking jimmy rubbed his chin for moment but monks are nt supposed to use swords ridiculous sword sighed okay you got me also ranger jimmy stopped short so you re ranger and monk and cleric are you anything else besides well am druid as well all right jimmy folded his arms tell me from top to bottom everything you are or not budging centimeter kinda personal would nt

20thlevel paladin magnaalumnae bard 31stlevel illusionist 49th level archmage 60thlevel weapons mistress and psionic lawful good because neither the book of infinite wisdom the book of finite wisdom nor the other book of infinite wisdom makes any stipulation against druids or bards or thieves or assassins changing their alignment she paused reached into the astral plane and pulled her brownie down into the physical universe this is my familiar the ridiculous brownie say hello to the nice little halfelven boy ridiculous brownie hi nice little halfelven boy the brownie said and disappeared back into the astral world there ridiculous sword finished are you satisfied jimmy rolled his eyes up into his head and fainted when he woke up twelve seconds later he found ridiculous sword leaning over him about to cast some kind of wakeup spell oh my deity jimmy moaned you re more wellequipped than sick sword ridiculous sword stopped gesticulating smiled smile of sudden understanding closed her eyes and nodded her head sick sword was my mother your mother sick sword ridiculous sword they had the same last name and everything now it all made sense well almost all of it did you said sick sword was your mother ridiculous sword nodded solemnly up until couple days ago like said my brother is my most powerful enemy your own brother killed your mom mmm hmm fraid so evil little sonofabitch is nt he did nt even leave soul behind to resurrect so you re an orphan like me well not quite my dad still alive but he just 9thlevel bythebook paladin he nice guy though well anyway like was trying to say ve got some pretty powerful enemies so you ll need some protection she took portable hole out of her pocket with piece of masking tape across the top on the strip of tape were scribed the words sick sword stuff excess opening the hole she reached in rummaged around noisily and finally pulled out gray solid adamantite broadsword and handed it to jimmy here she told him this ought to help the instant jimmy grabbed the haft the sword will took advantage of the opportunity and lanced fullforce into him brilliant white light scintillated outward from the blade an ominous fanfare wafted through the air and voice both telepathic and auditory boomed am the sick sword yyyyikes said jimmy meekly before sick sword was was before central earth was was oh come on ridiculous sword thought you ve only been around for twelve or thirteen years am all things great and powerful all creatures great and small served in the hand of the greatest weaponsmistress clericarchmage that ever lived can fell an ogre with swipe of my backhand the sick sword felt ridiculous glove grab hold of its adamantite blade cool it sicky ridiculous sword ordered or ll find humble ant to crush you beneath the foot of the adamantite broadsword was instantly silent sick sword she continued this is jimmy your new wielder you re to protect him just as you did sick sword understand sigh all right do you want to be my new owner jimmy well yeah sure jimmy decided excellent what you re alignment uh kinda chaoticlawful with neutral tendencies well it lawfulgood now huh what do you artifact side effect alignment of possessor permanently changed to that of item you are lawfulgood now whether you like it or not oh and also supposed to place geas or quest on you ridiculous sword leered at the weapon menacingly so um uh your geas is to er seek out and find the um uh holy grail jimmy asked the sword pointed at him defensively he said it not me ridiculous sword snapped her fingers no matter wish that jimmy were ungeased whew the sword exhaled well that was nt so bad now was it well dunno jimmy told the sick sword ai nt never been geased before jimmy this is vorpal 9lives stealing broadsword of wounding dancing and life stealing it made of solid adamantite do you know what that means yeah it means get to hack up the bad guys wham hack swoosh he swung the sword around precariously three times no no no it means she grabbed the sword again to keep him from slicing haphazardly through the air that you ve got ta learn how to use it to defend yourself in other words you got ta know how to parry as well as how to attack one of the sword major artifact powers will reduce your base armor class to but that certainly is nt enough to make you hitproof now then what your dex er my what your dex you know your dexterity well guess pretty good with my fingers you guess you mean you do nt know no should by god ii what kind of world is this where people dont even know their own character abilities where your character sheet my what ridiculous sword conked herself on the head how do you expect to keep track of your experience points without character sheet well um always just thought that well uh you know ridiculous sword sighed feeling rather vexed and reached into the outer planes right above jimmy head she pulled out yellow sheet of paper with lots of markings on it and the name jimmy written in bold calligraphy let see jimmy half elven level she eyed the sheet and the boy warily oh that right only pure elves never get to be 0th level ahem strength 12 intelligence wisdom 11 dexterity 13 constitution 10 charisma she looked at him over the top of his character sheet you re not much are you jimmy grimaced but did nt bother to reply ridiculous sword took his hand come with me she said jimmy shrugged and nodded his consent not that he had much choice in the matter ridiculous sword second helm glowed purple for moment and they found themselves within great cavern at the core of majestic mountain with his natural infravisual capability jimmy saw massive stone chair carved out of the stone on one side of the cave intricate mosaics of ivory platinum and adamantite adorned the bejewelled throne it was pretty awesomelooking even in the infrared this is the throne of the gods ridiculous sword told him indicating the chair sit on it um sit on it jimmy inquired not quite believing her and still little shaken up from that teleport ridiculous sword nodded go on sit on it jimmy took few faltering steps toward the relic are you sure this is good idea would lie to you do nt know would you ridiculous sword sighed look here ll even cast detect lie spell on you so you can tell if telling the truth she did now then that throne is perfectly harmless jimmy put hand to his chin what does that little red light over your head mean er um uh all right then that throne is perfectly harmless if you do as say in jimmy mind the light over her head changed from red to green well okay jimmy acquiesced turning back toward the seat but no funny stuff jimmy hands trembled so badly he could barely hold on to the arm rests as he sat himself down now repeat after me ridiculous sword told him semper fidelis cum regio spaticum est what that mean jimmy asked never mind what it means just say it but what it mean it means holy fidelity it space ship all right so say it semper fidelis cum regio spaticum est semper fidelis cum regio spaticum est sic transit gloria tuesdi sick transit gloria tuesdi lisanalgaib shaihulud muaddib kwisatz haderach shield lasgun explosion listenalgaib shyhoolud mauddib quizzat hatrack shieldlazegun explosion abra cadabra presto changeo abra cadabra presto changeo and the instant he finished changeo he felt somehow different feel somehow different he said ridiculous sword smiled prime power all of possessor ability totals raised to 18 each upon pronouncement of command word those little phrases gave you to say were the command word now you have straight eighteens across the board jimmy eyes bugged out you mean 18 strength 18 intelligence 18 wisdom 18 dexterity 18 constitution and eighteen charisma ridiculous sword finished but suppose do nt want straight 18 across the board oh nonsense everybody wants all 18 everybody except people who have 19 that is which reminds me oh no you do nt jimmy insisted standing up and moving away from the throne bad enough that can outclass most nobility right now you re not getting me pumped up any further ridiculous sword folded her arms could never get my father to do even as much as you just did maybe that was because ringman knew that all of his abilities would get permanently raised to 18 if he did that you never told me what you were doing with me gehenna youve hardly ever told me anything what are you cleric or something naturally part cleric part oh how could forget about your eleven classes especially now with my 18 intelligence for the positive material plane sake he slammed his fist down on rock outcropping leaving an 18 strength fistshaped indentation there you see you ve already given me more power than know what to do with come on you can handle it you ve got an 18 wisdom jimmy was about to formulate reply when ridiculous sword snapped her fingers oh wait minute almost forgot she reached into pouch strapped to her side and pulled out two baubles that jimmy could nt quite see you do nt have psionics do you well no why would jimmy stopped short ridiculous sword rolled the pair of icosahedrons across the cave floor since each face was marked with the roll was of course doublezero or one hundred well you do now she told him jimmy slapped his palm over his face sure your intelligence wisdom and charisma just went up remember ridiculous sword rolled again another 00 172 psionic strength she rolled yet again all attack another roll and defense modes and yet fifth roll of the crystalline loaded percentile dice four minor and two major psionic disciplines jimmy did nt bother to uncover his eyes he just shook his head okay for now your psionic devotions are invisibility cell adjustment domination and reduction and your psionic sciences are energy control and probability travel but youll get more powers once we get you in touch with some spheres of annihilation why me jimmy moaned they eventually made it back onto the prime material plane thanks to whole lot of complaining on jimmy part and walked the rest of the way to his old house ridiculous sword went in and turned the place inside out in three minutes flat found seven silver pieces and three coppers in loose change she said but that all your parents had lying around of course jimmy replied rents are cheap around here ridiculous sword put her fists to her hips rent hasnt been invented yet oh yeah forgot well we were just meager serftype village folk who earned poor but honest living oh give it up you did nt even have single electrum piece stashed under the mattress in fact you did nt even have mattress well like hay it feels comfortable except when it makes me sneeze it also makes you smell like farm animal everybody around here smells like farm animal soap has nt been invented yet either remember ridiculous sword relaxed her posture oh yeah sorry only intelligence 19 you know so you ve ransacked my house and come out saying that everything me and my family have ever owned is useless to me now so what so now we have to get you better place to stay how would you like to come live at my late mother keep for while really wow that be neat whoo can this boy mood change fast ridiculous sword figured this ridiculous sword indicated the updrawn gangplank in front of the small castle is the drawbridge wow just like on real castle jimmy said excitedly you would think he had only read about these places and never seen them or something hey ds ridiculous sword shouted lower the db disgusting sword stuck her ethereal head through the adamantitereinforced drawbridge said okay drew her head back in solidified and pulled the lever marked down the drawbridge cranked down across the moat to the sound of clanking adamantite chains and this through here ridiculous sword led jimmy across the drawbridge is the foyer this is where my sister and have placed rather strong protection from evil spell just in case our brother or anybody he in cahoots with decides to visit us yeah kinda figured that from the thaumaturgic circle inscribed on the floor there you would nt have known that was thaumaturgic circle with your old intelligence of twelve now would you as matter of fact saw thaumaturgic circle being demonstrated two years ago and would have recognized it anyway nyaah and this ridiculous sword quickly changed the subject is the room where my mother used to sleep it ll be your room for the time being um oh do nt worry all her magic items ve been moved out um more worried about her ghost ridiculous sword lowered her head involuntarily her eyes felt moist if she had ghost we could bring her back oh jimmy voice trailed off somehow he understood sorry did nt know it all right wish bahamut had nt had to follow in her path though jimmy gulped hard bahamut dead too as doornail platinum doornail voice approached from the other room uh jimmy ridiculous sword indicated the entering girl this is my big sister disgusting sword hey she put her hands on her hips and addressed ridiculous sword who the cutie ridiculous sword rolled her eyes up into her head and pointed at the other girl with her thumb she just entering puberty oh jimmy replied well just entering puberty too disgusting sword grinned girlishly found him ridiculous sword insisted so he mine nyaah oh yeah disgusting sword retorted well double nyaah nyaah nyaah pttttttttt they both raspberried each other lockhorned girls girls let not fight over me jimmy grabbed their opposing shoulders and tried to tear them apart they would nt budge no matter how hard he pulled what gives he strained to say thought had an 18 strength you do ridiculous sword told him without flinching we just happen to have 25 strength oh 25 star strength disgusting sword corrected her anyways like was saying ridiculous sword said smugly as she put her arms around jimmy neck found him so hes mine now she pulled up little closer to him and playfully kissed his cheek ew jimmy wrenched himself away from her do nt wan na be kissed by no girl he wiped her smooch off as harshly as he could disgusting sword shook her head as she left the room what waste of an 18 charisma both ridiculous sword and jimmy were silent for some time then ridiculous sword said hmmph looks like we ve all got some growing up to do jimmy folded his arms phh boy ll say you two didnt know when to quit your attitude toward my er affections was nt exactly the most mature on central earth either bub aw that just sissy game yeah played by us sissy 60thlevel weapons masters sure and what do you want to be when you grow up oh that easy wan na be fighter he thrust the sick sword through the air again wan na hack up all sorts of vicious monsters and mount their heads on my wall on the wall of my palace that is the palace got by killing the villainous king that lived in it ha hack thrust die die die well can help train you in that direction if youd like you but you re girl and you re not even fighter besides oh sure not fighter he says only weapons mistress and paladin and ranger those do nt count oh yeah that right those are subclasses are nt they well actually the other book of infinite wisdom genuine dungeon master tm publication goes back and says that paladin actually not fighter but really subclass of cavalier but it close enough tell you what kiddo if you really want to get invincible you ought to be multiclassed say fightermagicuser or fighterthief or fighter magicuserthief or clericdruidfighterrangerweapons mastercavalierpaladinmagicuserthiefthiefacrobatassassin who ll change to become bard or no not gon na be fifteenclassed character want to be fighter just fighter you got that okay okay it was only suggestion hmmph surprised it was nt suggestion spell oh believe me it was you just got lucky and made your saving throw jimmy narrowed his gaze and eyed her warily you re sure we re on the same side no no do nt aim for my sword ridiculous sword instructed easily deflecting the latest hack of his sick sword aim for my body you re fighting me not my weapon but do nt wan na hurt do nt worry about that kiddo there no way you could really hit me just try to all right well okay hyyyyah jimmy swung his sword out and around in wide arc bladeon the blade was barely half way to its target when ridiculous sword brought her ridiculous broadsword to within an inch of his left eye jimmy gasped and dropped his blade that maneuver may have worked against someone wearing plate mail ridiculous sword told him as she slowly moved her sword away heavy armor ll slow down an opponent reaction time enough for you to finish blows like that but you left yourself wide open for anyone with half an ounce of speed to thrust his rapier through your heart or her broadsword through your left eye now let try again jimmy studied the distant mountains for few long seconds and rubbed his stockinged toes in the grass then he cleared his throat ahem sword of sickness come to my hand he commanded in lawful good the adamantite eternianlooking sword shot up from the ground and landed gripfirst in his palm now defend yourself ridiculous sword launched at him with both her ridiculous longsword and her ridiculous hand axe before her jimmy was barely able to draw sick sword old dagger of wounding and parry the adamantite longsword in time he was so relieved at having fended off her sword that he did nt cover his right side and received nasty run in his shirt from her hand axe that made him mad enough to forget about being nervous and hack at her with the sick sword as hard as he could ridiculous sword jerked to one side and easily avoided getting hit jimmy did nt get to stay angry for long three seconds later mere instant in this particular combat system ridiculous sword hacked at him again with her long sword forcing jimmy to block the blow with all his might adamantite clashed against adamantite then and again and again until their ordeal seemed to take on rhythm of its own every thrust or slash jimmy made ridiculous sword easily curved away every stab ridiculous sword took jimmy somehow managed to parry or avoid sure she was holding back but she was nt making this picnic for him finally after four long minutes of fruitless exchange jimmy backed up few feet loosed the sick sword to dance and drew sick sword old broadsword to attack with ridiculous sword shrugged sent her ridiculous longsword dancing into the air to deal with the sick sword and flashed the ridiculous broadsword into her right hand in the blink of an eye she also let her ridiculous hand axe dance after jimmy hey that not fair jimmy complained desperately fending off the adamantite axe my dagger does nt dance true but who to say your next opponent wo nt have holy vorpal defender frostbrand flametongue sun luckblade hand axe of wounding dancing life stealing slaying everything disruption throwing thunderbolts all dragon slaying speed final word and nine lives stealing with intelligence 17 speech and telepathy read languages and magic ten nonalignment languages eight extraordinary powers eight special purposes seven artifact minor benign powers twelve major benign powers and limited omniscience in one hand and nearlyidentical sword in the other the instant she said other jimmy found his opening ducked under the hand axe and came at her at full tilt she saw his sword hack coming mile away it would be easy enough to parr jimmy broadsword came within three inches of her right side jerked over and thrust right below her left ribcage surprised ridiculous sword reached down to the sheath on her left boot pulled out her ridiculous dagger intercepted jimmys thrust and sent his sword reeling two hundred feet through the air to land pointfirst on the center of target painted on rock amazing ridiculous sword told him lowering her dagger have nt seen feint like that in weeks you re real fighter material jimbo really you mean can be real honesttogosh fighter now that right jimmy you ve passed the test oh wow neat jimmy voice choked off as he shook and fell to his knees something was wrong inside him something was definitely wrong he felt his stomach convulse and he doubled over every muscle every fiber every epidermal fragment of his body rumbled like it was about to explode he pressed his palms into his throbbing temples wha what happening ridiculous sword fished two baubles out of her pocket and handed them to jimmy here quick roll these okay jimmy strained barely able to hold on to the objects if it ll stop this he tossed them they rolled along the ground and tumbled to stop jimmy gasped and yelled it got worse heeeeeeellp he looked down at his spasmodic arms what looked like bubbles underneath the skin stretched it completely out of proportion he could hear muscle and tendon fibers rapidly snapping and reforming like cracking celery it was nt tenth as uncomfortable as it was horrifying what happening to me you just became fighter ridiculous sword explained with an 18 strength fighters with 18 strengths get to roll for exceptional strength gave you those doublezero dice to roll just to be sure you got as strong as an ogre you what and just as suddenly as the transformation had begun it ceased jimmy skin came out toughened and weathered although it was still 18 charisma skin muscles bulged from his body where he did nt know halfelves could have muscles the great phantom character sheet in the sky told him that he had the full 14 hit points he felt like vomiting ridiculous sword approached him and put her arm around his shoulders she looked into his eyes and said welcome to level one peter perfect stopped scanning with his eyes of the eagle from his warhorse saddle across about mile of dry lakebed he seen what he was hoping for well well well he told his horse and his holy sword it looks like ringman decided to face me on my own turf well see how well he handles himself without magic ballista he put his funny glasses away held prometheus in his right hand and the warhorse reins in his left and with tiny jolt instructed the horse to trot toward the approaching ringman he surveyed the landscape one more time absolutely flat not tree or bush or rock or dumb old human to mar the expanse of barrenness this place had his name written all over it nothing was quite so impressive as his castle jutting up from the center of all this nothingness it also gave ringman and any goodytwoshoes cohorts he might happen to be carrying along with him nowhere to hide like that brownie peter saw riding on his shoulder yeah he figured as he rode closer maybe he capture the brownie and torture it just to see what ringman would do or maybe he torture ringman to see what the brownie would do or perhaps he torture ringman and the brownie to see what ringman horse would do ringman rode up toward him on his own horse unusually confident for being about to face his old nemesis homer the brownie rode on his left shoulder meteoriteiron steel plate barding rode almost weightlessly over the warhorse body and ringman holy avenger rode in its scabbard rather than in his hand he flinched as peter perfect shot him sinister grin but quickly recuperated he also noticed that peter perfect had probably been reading the other book of infinite wisdom hed traded in the gauntlets and chausses of his adamantitealloyed plate mail for pureadamantitemetal full plate armor their horses trotted toward each other until they were practically nose to nose well ringman old buddy old pal peter perfect chided what brings you to my realm of dread how can the dungeon master let this guy stay paladin ringman thought ve come here to settle grudge that more than decade old he told him oh peter perfect asked sarcastically and what grudge might that be hmm ringman shook his head and grinned bit you and me you disgrace to paladinhood you and so long as you stay the way you are right now ashamed to share your character class oh see so you ve finally come to die peter cracked his knuckles no ringman replied quite calmly ve come to bring you down the beardless paladin chuckled through his nose you must be joking you alone ah but not alone ringman observed ve brought friend pphhh what the late sick sword little brownie homer sure brought him flurry of scintillating dust grains wafted away from spot two feet to the left of ringman horse as the wind carried the dust away from what it had been obscuring or rather concealing there resolved the form of tenandahalf year old girl with an adamantite dagger in her left hand and an adamantite broadsword in her right also brought along my first born ringman explained gulp gulped peter perfect ddddisgusting sword you here how what like lightning bolt that had drunken permanent potion of speed at 150 effectiveness disgusting sword bolted up onto peter saddle and stuck holy vorpal dagger of wounding dancing life stealing and nine lives stealing in front of his face hello peter perfect she grinned ve wanted to meet you for so long peter perfect shook with fear even though paladins were immune to fear by then then dismounted his horse as fast as he could without speaking word disgusting sword got down too and zipped around in front of him again hey peter said wwwait minute disgusting character too ve got rights yknow and besides armor class 23 you could nt hit me by rolling anything less than natural twenty you ca nt fool me that easily you weak boson read dragon and dragrace too the dungeon master relinquished that natural20onlynomatterhowmanytohitbonusesyouhave restriction long ago ah bbbut then can hit you too peter held prometheus defensively in front of him it shook in his hand like divining rod of course you can hit me too only ac negative twentyseven but have nearly four times as many hit points as you do and part weapons mistress could tear you apart in two seg er twelve seconds hey baby telepathic message wafted into disgusting sword head from prometheus how you like to use real macho holy longsword back off buddy the disgusting dagger replied telepathically to the sword she with me prometheus was the first intelligent sword on central earth in centuries to visibly cringe um peter perfect began um uh surrender or die disgusting sword offered surrender peter perfect yelped prometheus fell to the ground as his hands shot into the air whew he thought glad she made it easy on me to decide disgusting sword shrugged and said good she snapped her fingers peter warhorse obeyed blindly and sank to its knees there was nothing quite like permanent potion of animal control at 150 effectiveness peter perfect had one of those too but he thought better of using it at this point now the first thing we take off of your body shhhhink she exposed peter woolen undies is this invulnerable coat of arnd here dad keep this warm for me will ya she tossed it to ringman do have choice he replied fumbling the chain shirt with his mere 17 dexterity hmmph peter thought it good thing dragged the torso and groin plates from that full plate along for just such an occasion next she took off his belt goes your girdle of titan strength here ringman why dontcha put this on ringman caught it while still holding on to arnds invulnerable coat thought we went through why wo nt put this on before hah those fools peter thought little do they realize that have permanent potion of titan strength in effect on me and do nt try to get away by using that permanent potion of titan strength you have in effect on you disgusting sword warned him have atlas strength um what ringman began atlas has 25star strength the brownie whispered in his ear and finally we take away each and every item on your person that increases your saving throw versus magic disgusting sword took away his cloak of protection his 3in a5footradius ring of protection although why peter perfect would want to protect anyone but himself was beyond her his stone of good luck his luck blade longsword his scarab of protection and his axe of the dwarvish lords then dispelled the protection from good spell he had permanently placed upon him she bared her archmagi robe and cast charm person spell on you she waved her hands through the air stuck her two index fingers up her nose and cried oolam caloophid baeower gazots diddlysquat barnstorm hotten and tots if do nt charm you think ll just cry so be under my power or you ll have to die there was tremendous crash of thunder as waves of magical force cascaded down from the positive material plane through disgusting sword and into peter perfect head ghostly voices rose up from all around to help control peter mind her robe of the archmagi shone an awesome white it was overwhelming and then nothing happened oh well she said looks like he made his saving throw he had or better chance of making it anyway so now what do you do ringman asked easy ll just cast it few more times until he blows it she did two tries later he was as harmless as 20th level paladin kitten heck she did nt even have to use her permanent potion of elf halfelf and human control yesmaster peter addressed disgusting sword in monotone his arms jutting out in front of him whatmayido foryou get on your horse she directed him and ride off to sick sword old keep you do know where that is do nt you ofcourseido ihavebeentherebefore oh and when was that wheniseducedsickswordandinjectedtiamatsevilseed intoherwomb when you you what she was completely surprised she could even be attacked using six second intervals as minutes right then thought you knew ringman said sure peter continued zombielike thatwaswhenshe waspregnantwithgrosssword disgusting sword just sat there with her mouth open it took her twelve seconds to finally say we ve got to get this back to ridiculous sword right ringman answered and gave his horse little snap on the reins he started trotting off with peter perfect and his warhorse following close behind oh and in the mean time disgusting sword told ringman you might want to replace the main section of your plate mail with the invulnerable coat of arnd ridiculous sword heard them entering through the keeps drawbridge disgusting sword usually lowered it by using her unseen servant and saw them through the open door of her room oh hi ds she said taking her hands out of jimmy pants you re right puberty lots of fun disgusting sword stepped aside and pulled peter perfect into ridiculous sword view from behind ringman peter arms were still out stiff in front of him rs we have to talk ridiculous sword puzzled at the charmed paladin in front of her fiddling with her medallion of esp she had the answer in six seconds so this is peter perfect eh um why you take him out of the dungeon we did nt take him out disgusting sword told her he escaped over nine years ago nine ye disgusting sword shrugged did nt even hear about it until this morning it good thing dad decided to mention it to me like said ringman explained thought you knew and what he been doing for those nineplus years disgusting sword nudged peter perfect with her elbow tell her what you told me youmeanabouthowimadeadealwithtiamattoinjecta seedofevilintosickswordswombwhileshewaspregnantwith grosssword ridiculous sword jaw just about dropped to the floor yes that it disgusting sword told him imadeadealwithtiamattoinjectaseedofevilinto sickswordswombwhileshewaspregnantwithgrosssword peter told them that what thought he said jimmy commented so that means ridiculous sword figured gross sword was drawn toward evil by an outside agent it wasnt all moms fault knew it why did you make such deal disgusting sword asked the cleanshaven mindcontrolled paladin itwasinourmutualinterests tiamatgottospreadevil alloverthemultiverseandigottohavemyrevengeagainstthe womanwhodestroyedtheiudc andherhusband and how did you manage to keep your paladinhood jimmy asked silly question ringman thought sillyquestion peter bleated ididitforthesakeof perpetuatingmyidealoflawfulgoodness which is liveandletlive unlessyoudontagreewiththem say ringman voice from peter perfect side cut in it was prometheus since my master is in no shape to kill anything how about you and me teaming up again ringman put his fists to his hips why prometheus what wonderful fairweather friend you are he pointed out the nearest glassee spell er window see that pool over there well it really fresh water and quick dip now might be refreshing you sure you do nt want me the holy avenger pleaded now and how did you manage that easy peter perfect just shucked out the 20 000 extra gold pieces and had me upgraded go disappear in puff of logic ringman cursed it fine the holy avenger replied ll take that as no for now hmmph disgusting sword noted if prometheus were an artifact give it the humble ant treatment ridiculous sword totally ignored their sidetrack she was too deep in thought about the nineyearold news she just received how many times have been in conference with the gods how many times have asked my contactotherplane or vision spells if there anything unusual going on she read ringman mind briefly limbo even melnic the loud bard university knew about what peter did to mom why did everybody keep it secret hey jimmy perked up maybe there was conspiracy going on against you what makes you say that disgusting sword asked cause then you could go out and find the conspirators and hack them to pieces wham wham die die die ridiculous sword waved his gestures aside no god ii damn it there has to be reason in the months that ve been disgusting character ve contacted just about every deity known to man and humanoid good evil lawful chaotic or otherwise supreme beings who hate each other do nt just conspire to withhold information from the most powerful force of lawful good in the multiverse or the second most powerful force of lawful good in the multiverse disgusting sword interjected just the same we should have heard something about it hmmmm wonder the fact that we didnt know gave gross sword time to be able to do all the sick disgusting gross ridiculous unbelievable things he done without our butting in until it was too late some greater force out there wanted gross sword to get to my power level maybe if we knew more about why we could find out how to bring our dear 34brother down jimmy puzzled but if the gods wo nt talk to you the happy hunting grounds the gods wo nt talk to me ridiculous sword stammered ll make them talk and without another word the most powerful force of lawful good in the multiverse amuletoftheplanesed out of there she emerged on the plane of gladsheim this was the outer plane of chaotic good neutrals and like most of the outer planes was multilayered the first level of gladsheim and the only level touching the astral plane was named asgard the second which housed the dead warrior heroes brought there by the valkyries along with few fire giants was named muspelheim and the third where the norse gods reigned was named nidavellir unlike the other outer planes the three layers of gladsheim were connected to each other by two rainbow bridges ridiculous sword approached the first bridge very large flaming battle axe came down and blocked her path halt the axe owner demanded showing off his gold teeth who goes there oh come on heimdall dontcha recognize me heimdall gulped ridiculous sword whwhwhat do you want here want to go to nidavellir and see ol papa smurf heimdall cleared his throat threateningly no one as lawful as yourself may cross this rainbow bridge without first crossing heimdall now really do you think wimpy battle axe like that one is going to stand chance against me how did you know my axe was easy it the strongest kind of battle axe the other book of infinite wisdom lists on its miscellaneous magic weapons tables now let me in no ridiculous sword blinked her eyes and dimension doored to the other side of the bridge looks like you do nt have much choice in the matter she shouted back to him and departed fortytwo seconds later the rainbow bridge leading from muspelheim to nidavellir did nt have any picky old guard on it so she did nt bother wasting one of her 399 remaining fourthlevel spells on it however there was god on the other side with long blond hair and great big magic war hammer in his hands wearing gauntlets of ogre power and girdle of giant strength riding on chariot drawn by two trained attack goats who was spouting curses at her odds and forsooth the blondhaired god thundered knowest not how ye managed to pass by heimdall at yon bifroest bridge but ye had better get thine buns back to where thou camest from or know the wrath of my magick war hammer of thunderbolts mjolnir do nt think clerasil would like you using his hammer ridiculous sword pointed out you dare to mock the god of thunder eateth hot lightning bolts lawful slime he pointed his mjolnir at ridiculous sword and pulled the trigger she made her saving throw that is she did nt roll and easily jutted her hips to one side the bolt missed her so thou thinkest thou canst escapeth my wrath just because thou art monk and taketh no damage from an attack if thou makst thy saving throw well that ll not save thee from mjolnirs adamantitealloyed steel head the thunder god cocked back his right arm and swung his hammer mighty blow ridiculous sword drew her two main weapons parried mjolnir with her ridiculous hand axe and jutted the ridiculous broadsword to within mil of the blond gods neck that was nt very polite she told him um er uh phhh the god of thunder groped for words as he blew some blond hair out of his face ridiculous sword took the sword away thank you she said and walked over toward odin place at leisurely 2560 feet per second odin place had colossal pink neon sign over the drawbridge that read by invitation only ridiculous sword got out little piece of fleece ground it between her 25 strength palms blew the fleece dust at the sign and chanted the ancient mystical words permanent illusion that being done she leapt over the moat and smashed through the adamantitereinforced drawbridge odin turned from his wife frigga with whom he was having dreadful argument and shouted who dares smash humanshaped hole through my drawbridge ridiculous sword snapped her fingers and centered continual light spell two feet above her head me and who art thou ridiculous sword the most powerful force of lawful good in the multiverse odin was furious did nt invite you take another look at your sign odin peered through the window at the pink glowing letters sure enough the sign now read by invitation only unless your name happens to be ridiculous sword upstarts and robes odin cursed ll show thee whos boss in gladsheim he walked over to one wall of the chamber and grabbed on to crossbrace several feet across which had barrel glued to it he pulled the crossbrace moved slowly away from the wall and exposed more and more of thick sheet of polished metal the sheet was long and narrow and had sharp edges it was about ten feet out of the wall before ridiculous sword realized that the crossbrace was actually hilt the barrel was actually grip and the sheet of metal was actually the blade to the biggest sword she had ever seen bar none when odin finally finished drawing his sword from the wall it was about twentyfive feet long and must have weighed well over half ton what that ridiculous sword asked twelvehanded sword avast ye yon varlet hast thou not heard of the odinsword thought you normally used gungnir the spear with the neverceasing thrust man can only keep thrusting for so long thou knowst and besides if use the odinsword can do more damage that way odin swooshed the gigantic sword around the room at ridiculous sword as she ducked ridiculous sword wondered if that sword should nt have been named after her she had nt the foggiest idea how odin kept it balanced the first sword hack whooshed harmlessly over her head and nearly hit frigga whom odin may have been aiming at as well for all she knew it would take odin about two minutes to finish following through on that swing and hack at them again in the opposite direction that would be more than enough time for ridiculous sword to do her thing she rushed up to odin the head god grabbed the odinsword out of his hands broke it in two across her leg slapped him harshly on the wrist shook her finger at him and declared tch tch tch naughty boy did nt your mother ever tell you not to play with knives and with that both odin and frigga fainted ridiculous sword had odin back on his feet within eighteen seconds now tell me she demanded why did nt you tell me about peter perfect pact with tiamat to taint the baby in sick sword womb odin shrugged ddddungeon master orders no telling the player characters anything about peter perfect honest that all know ridiculous sword stared him warily in the eye and cast detect lie spell on him the green spot over his head meant that he was telling the truth she sighed guess ll have to try some other outer planes then but one more question just what in the universe is player character and try some other outer planes she did olympus was like gladsheim all over again what with zeus hera and ares being dead ringers for odin frigga and thor it was also as fruitless as the norse plane she throttled few greater devils she found running around in acheron but they only gave her the same sob story on the happy hunting grounds it seemed that the only word the natives knew how to speak was how she broke some of the inhabitants of nirvana out of their meditative stupors and looked into their minds but all that got her were pictures of the back walls of their skulls the boss tyrant king and queen of the elemental planes of earth fire water and air were likewise uninformed even going up into the face of god ii her own deity on the seventh layer of heaven only got her mild suntan she materialized on the keep floor and rested her head on her hands ringman turned to his newlyreappearing daughter with no more feeling than if she just come back from going into town he was almost used to this kind of stuff by now how it go he asked ridiculous sword could have just said learned absolutely nothing and been done with it but instead she fired up her telepathic projection and compressed every detail of the last two hours into sixsecondlong beam aimed at ringmans cerebral cortex ringman got the message all right in very forceful way wow he said not used to seeing things through the eyes of your ten yearold daughter eh ridiculous sword asked him not in the slightest also not exactly used to seeing things through the eyes of disgusting character say speaking of disgusting characters have you read the new paladin rules in the other book of infinite wisdom in the other book of infinite wisdom ringman inquired sure you know the one with the picture of the brass headed alchemist looking googooeyed at tome on the front cover um is this something supposed to know about it only the official upgrade to both the book of infinite wisdom and the book of finite wisdom as authorized by the dungeon master oh no have nt seen the upgraded paladin rules well then ridiculous sword smiled hauling out her copy for starters you re no longer subclass of fighters youre now subclass of this other class called cavalier and since cavaliers do nt have any prime requisite you do nt get any 10 experience point bonuses anymore oh ringman worried he checked his tally no problem still ninth level with fiftyfive thousand points to spare you also get to train your strength dexterity constitution and charisma every time you gain level until they re all 18 or 1800 are immune to fear project protection from fear aura in 10 foot radius can vault into the saddle and have your horse underway in six seconds flat ride your horse at 20 yards per minute faster than normal not counting horseshoes of speed remain conscious all the way down to negative however many hit points you had at first level have 90 immunity to any mental magic including psionic blast and since you re ninth level are at to hit and to damage with mounted lance and to hit with long sword ringman gaped you mean have this globe of antifear emanating from my body the air within ten feet of him suddenly glowed dim grey can hit better with my holy sword he could almost feel his hack and thrust improve and by now would have maxed out on my dexterity his new and improved nerve endings gave him buzz my constitution his torso bulged out to accommodate the extra hit points my now full ogre strength his musculature broadened and toughened and my charisma phantom breeze swept his hair back in gentle rolling curve all because somebody decided to change the rules again you bet keep my mind eye peeled for those kinds of things all the time heck would nt even have gotten that extra fifth level druid spell those two extra sixth level druid spells or those three extra seventh level druid spells if had nt heard that druids can now go all the way to 15th level and become the grand druid in fact they can go all the way to 23rd level as hierophant and get all sorts of neat interplanar powers although you get to cast six more levels worth of druid spells if you stay grand druid disgusting sword called out from the next room and not only that she whipped magazine out of one of her portable holes the special other book of infinite wisdom supplementary issue of dragon dragrace says that weapons masters can specialize or double specialize in single melee weapon just like fighters and rangers can they get their numberofattacksperminute entry shifted to the next better category with this weapon and get to hit and to damage with it tohit and damage if they double specialize and of course these tohit bonuses add into their armor class when they re actively parrying just like all their other hundred or so bonuses do oh wow so now you re even more disgusting is that right hey get 15 attacks per minute with any of my ridiculous weapons 18 per minute with my ridiculous hand axe which retroactively double specialized in also retroactively gave the axe some powers from the new magic weapons they have in there even the new prometheus is an official weapon type since they added defenders and holy avengers to the magic swords tables see this she whipped out an ordinarylooking spoon this ordinarylooking spoon is spoon of stirring stir any potion with it and if you re real lucky the potion comes out at twice normal strength not just 150 effectiveness twice normal strength oh and almost forgot you have another character ability to worry about now comeliness comeliness what that the chance have of co er no no no no no comeliness is how good looking you are hey disgusting sword she called out how many dice does ringman get to roll up his comeliness with disgusting sword walked in carrying her personal copy of the other book of infinite wisdom she flipped to page 74 um well since his other six abilities are already rolled up either 4d6 discarding the lowest die or 3d6 six times choosing the best roll of the six she looked up at ringman too bad you get to roll 5d6 and discard the lowest two dice if you were pure cavalier ridiculous sword took out four dice and rolled them across the floor they came up and fourteen she told him plus for having charisma of 18 makes 17 comeliness darn you just missed the next higher category of attractiveness but you re pretty goodlooking though ringman glanced at his distorted reflection in the arm of his plate mail then he looked back at them in disbelief do nt look damn bit different he insisted do you mean that if you had rolled four my comeliness would be lets see five six ridiculous sword corrected him okay six and that would suddenly become homely no if rolled four have rolled it over but that cheating no it is nt it good business practice ringman grumbled slightly chivalry was fast becoming fourletter word well at least not excessively good looking um what would happen to me if were in that next comeliness category if you were in the 18 to 21 range you fascinate practically every woman you met and be the envy of most ordinary looking males as it is though you re just plain old runof themill goodlooking fascinate practically every woman met ringman thought and missed it by one hmm wonder if any of them could measure up to sick sword oh geez almost forgot ridiculous sword expounded you got couple more cavalier restrictions besides your normal paladin ones more restrictions oh great what do have to give up now well first off you have to take lance as your first weapon of proficiency but do nt even have lance you do now ringman searched his memory he did remember lance being stashed in one niche of his castle although he could nt remember having put it there or even having remembered it before oh all right ll give up weapons familiarity with that light crossbow of mine never use it anyway and you have to prefer dagger over hand axe do nt tell me ringman looked at the loop in his belt where his hand axe used to be in its place was dagger of throwing he wondered briefly why it was nt his old dagger that was only against largerthanmansized opponents until he remembered that the other book of infinite wisdom had created few more miscellaneous magic weapons since then he had no idea where the 1500 gold piece price difference between hand axe and the cheaper throwing dagger had gone and you have to choose full or field plate armor over plate mail even if the plate armor is nonmagical what ringman gasped he snatched the book from ridiculous sword hands and read the cavalier entry after his eyes bugged out at what it said he flipped over to the description of new armor types he read to himself for few seconds then looked up in dismay my deity they want me to replace this this perfectly gallantlooking armor of adamantite alloyed plate mail with tin suit that actually becomes one armor class worse if it absorbs too much damage disgusting sword and ridiculous sword nodded in unison that right ringman could feel the arms and legs of his armor vibrating ringman had good idea of what was about to happen oh no he cursed covering his face with his hands not again he took his hands away and gazed skyward all right get it over with by the time he looked back down six seconds later every piece of plate mail on his body had become mithralalloyed piece of full plate armor mithral alloyed ringman asked but that only only plus four he says ridiculous sword snickered this coming from the man who absolutely refuses to wear girdle of titan strength but does nt mithralalloyed full plate armor cost mucho gold pieces you got discount from not getting the full suit and 1500 gold pieces worth of credit from exchanging your hand axe besides she turned small fragment of milliongoldpiece gem to the light we covered the difference and anyways disgusting sword noted with full plate after it absorbs its 90damagepoint limit you ll be exactly the same armor class you were in plate mail ridiculous sword shrugged we could have got you pure adamantite full plate but that was nt on the treasure list in the other book of infinite wisdom and we know how you cant stand to bend the rules oh thank you ever so much for sparing me the embarrassment think ll go take bath in crysglass lake now for year or two to see if mithral alloyed steel can rust awh do nt be so sore just think now you can stay conscious all the way down to 16 hit points ringman did doubletake but only had 13 hit points at first level not any more you did nt you get d10 plus three hit points at level one in addition to your constitution bonus oh but then should have had 17 hit points at 1st level because my constitution just went up to 18 no your constitution did nt make it up to 18 until you were third level oh well forgive me for not remembering something that never happened to me geez my are nt we in testy mood today ridiculous sword pulled glass full of smokycolored liquid out of her ethereal cooler here drink this you ll feel better ohhhh no you do nt ringman insisted almost fell for that last time what is it today doublestrength permanent potion of extra healing at 150 effectiveness no no no nothing like that ridiculous sword assured him and the 150 effectiveness bit is nt cumulative with the twicenormalstrength thing anyway you just looked like you could use drink jimmy materialized by the side of the room he had just gone through several spheres of annihilation with some severe magical protection and was trying out his new psionic disciplines sometimes he could nt stand having all these powers but usually he just thought they were neat no thank you ringman waved ridiculous sword glass away not thirsty well sure am jimmy interrupted walking toward the center of the room if you wo nt drink this will he took the glass from ridiculous sword hands and swallowed it down it was good enough for him to lick his chops and wipe his mouth on his sleeve mmmm that tasted great what was it permanent potion of invulnerability at twice normal strength ridiculous sword told him in perfectly level voice jimmy gazed down at the glass then down at the floor said oh and strolled slowly out of the room only one more permanent potion to go jimmy ridiculous sword told him pouring the contents of her bowl of potion mixing back into its original decanter oil of acid resistance take off all your clothes jimmy eyed her warily for moment until he was sure she did nt want to play doctor with him then stripped bare ridiculous sword immediately began rubbing the acidproof liquid over every exposed portion of his body she lingered briefly around his groin when she got there but then moved on here jimbo you ll have to drink little of it too jimmy shrugged took mouthful from the container as she handed it to him and swallowed it with grimace oh god ii is that stuff bitter of course it bitter this is the most powerful antacid known to man and god alike now your mouth been coated and so has your throat and your stomach within about nine hours it ll have gone all the way through your digestive tract and you ll be acidproof on the inside from both ends you ll never get an ulcer and never have to worry about heartburn again heartburn that sounds like the title of an evil magicuser spell or something it does at that does nt it okay now gon na put drop in each eye it ll sting for couple seconds do nt worry jimmy said tensing up every muscle in his body and straining his voice can take it she let one drop fall into his left eye then his right after each of which jimmy blinked almost uncontrollably within few seconds his eyes felt normal again and by that time ridiculous sword had already finished coating the back of his neck and was working the oil into his left ear so rs jimmy began trying to take his mind off of his fifth rubdown that day if the gods ca nt give you any answers as to why they would nt give you any answers where ll you go next not sure she commented acidproofing his chest the gods were all hushed up about it for some reason figure it because they had to answer to higher station need to find someone who does nt have to answer to anybody someone on another plane who gets in on all the interplanar poop and yet is nt bothered by godly protocols oh he chuckled you mean like omnion omnion ridiculous sword said rolling the idea around in her mind omnion she repeated she just might know oh you are not serious jimmy quavered you bet am let get disgusting sword and we ll all meet her on the first plane of hell ccccould nt we just send her postcard mail has nt been invented yet then could nt you use one of your extraplanar powers to contact her from here she might not believe it us then you could make her believe it nope there ai nt no other way around it might need to be there to cast just the right spell on her or something so why do have to come along for the educational experience she finished coating his achilles heels with the oil now come on one minute and fortytwo seconds later ringman disgusting sword ridiculous sword and jimmy all materialized in the first layer of hell the place gave new meaning to the word hothouse 200 to 300 degrees was the likely temperature and the ground stank of burning sulfur vaguely humanoid blobs the lemures which all or nearly all new recruits in hell got turned into littered the ground as far as the horizon stretched every twelve feet or so an orcishlooking devil with whip and trident punctuated the sea of lemures now jimmy and ringman watch out for the devil taskmasters you two might be fire resistant but you re not fire immune at least not without being within twenty feet of that sick sword or any of our artifacts you especially be careful jimmy youre only firstlevel with only 14 hit points how come fire resistant ringman asked ridiculous sword and disgusting sword chanted the invulnerable coat of arnd an orclike taskmaster stopped beating up on one of his lemures and noticed the new arrivals hey who the here are you that none of your business ridiculous sword told him the orcdevil sniffed briefly in their direction youre you re all lawful good why ought to ridiculous sword and disgusting sword pulled out their holy symbols and shouted begone at practically the same time the devil turned black with fear and ran away with its barbed tail between its legs jimmy turned to the lemure the devil had been beating have you seen omnion he asked it uhhwuuuwuuwwuuuuuhpthhhht the lemure replied accidentally spitting up some internal glop jimmy wiped the ectoplasm off ewwwwwww he commented forgot those things barely have minds no problem ridiculous sword reassured him see her six seconds later everyone else saw her too she was nt lemure at all she was just plain old omnion stripped of all her magic items of course but still the same omnion ringman had slain eleven years hence she was stooped over rather large basin moving something in her hands backandforth against rough board suds covered whatever it was in her hands and the interior of the basin our four heroes walked toward her rather cautiously several darkshaded somethings were piled in heap behind her the back and top ends of the pile were lost in the darkness omnion saw them wrinkled her forehead and then smiled well hi all you lovely people was wondering when you get around to stopping by jimmy indicated the boundless mountain of stuff behind her what the pile what the pile he asks ha that good one whats the pile it dirty laundry that all ve been doing for the last eleven years is dirty laundry she wrung out the devilshaped shirt in her hands threw it at the lemure next to her told it rinse just as she had for the past 132 months took pair of pants down from the pile and dunked it in her basin and just think only have 988 years to go then can really show hell who boss no talking slave taskmaster shouted in her direction back to work omnion grabbed the taskmaster collar with one hand and drew him up to meet her gaze omnion the guard yelped sorry er didnt recognize you sorry is nt good enough she said tossed him in her basin scrubbed his head against her washing board took him out broke him in half across her right leg and flung his remains to the far horizon thanks to her permanent potion of titan strength oh do nt worry she told our heroes they ll replace him soon enough she took the pants in her basin in hand and began scrubbing and uh really sorry to hear about your mother little sicklets and your parents too jimmy her sinister smile revealed her stillperfect 18 charisma er 23 comeliness teeth so how come you have to put in 999 years of servitude ridiculous sword asked her ringman counted on his fingers and mumbled to himself 988 plus 11 was about 999 all right he never was much good at this math thing why omnion blurted because you have to everybody who gets sent to hell has to take anywhere from hundred to thousand years worth of torture depending on how evil you were while you were alive since was invulnerable to most of the things they could throw at me they assigned me to do hells laundry for 999 years was pretty pissed that they didnt think was worth the full millennium treatment she wrung the pants out threw them at the lemure next to her told him to rinse plucked pair of smelly underwear from the pile and chucked it into her tub yeah but why do you have to do it because they make me but could nt you just beat them all up sure could then why do nt you break out of your predicament she sighed they do nt make me by ordering me to do these things when they assign you to do something you have to do it you just plain have to it one of the laws of nature in this place for crying out loud now get out of here unless you have something important to do ridiculous sword folded her arms are nt you afraid we might kill you kill me heck go ahead nonexistence sounds like welcome relief from this monotonous lifestyle er deathstyle laundry that dull huh well it not all that bad in another fourandahalf centuries or so they re going to invent the washing machine and ll have more free time to do what please but still wont be able to leave this plane nope unuh nosirree that nono no interplanar travel until your torture period is over not even to any of the deeper layers of hell but you can contact other planes ca nt you oh phhhh anybody can do that good there been this sortof news blanket over every notfromtheprimematerialplane creature we ve talked to for the past decade or so it seems the dungeon master did nt want the gods to tell us about what peter perfect and tiamat did to our mom omnion grinned at their mentioning it take it you know about tiamat and her seed of evil then oh you bet omnion shot back heck could have told you about it even could have told you everything but did you once call up your she leered at ringman good buddy omnion and ask her hey omnion is there anything going on that we should know about no you just thought your own petty little deities and demigods would tell you everything come on this is the thirteenth century wake up and smell the adamantite do you honestly think god ii is going to be perfectly honest with you just because he your deity he not my deity ringman mumbled so then ridiculous sword got back on the main track do you know why the dungeon master forbade the gods to chat with us about it honey if knew why know why guess she scrubbed the underpants then do you have any idea why you bet the dungeon master was making one of his usual cruel and wanton proclamations ridiculous sword and disgusting sword eyes bugged out or maybe the dm was testing out his new hyperdimensional transport inverter beam when it malfunctioned and caused all non material beings within 700plane radius to be unable to talk about the event or maybe the big referee accidentally stepped on all the gods brains and wiped out their speech centers for decade do nt know ridiculous sword cast charm person spell on her few times just to make sure she was indeed telling the truth well thanks anyway she said and prepared to leave any time omnion sneered at her she watched them dematerialize in purple haze hmmmph she grumbled to herself wringing out the undees rasper the pit fiend thought he could rule hell forever when wierd dough vanquished all the archdevils eleven years ago ha only nine hundred eightyeight years left your days are numbered the halls of sick sword small keep had not sounded so quiet for years nobody said anything to anyone else since they gotten back of course part of that might have had to do with the fact that ringman disgusting sword and jimmy all went off to take nap disgusting sword found her sister sitting by the window staring out into space with her head resting on her left palm she had been like that for hours disgusting sword brought her halfway out of her trance by telepathically asking her what was going on oh nothing as usual ridiculous sword thought back nobody knows why gross sword contamination was hushed up nobody in this whole multiverse knows hardly any of them seem to care care you care oh sure and why did nt our own deity care why didnt anyone say anything did nt the forces of law and good give damn about what would happen to sick sword or to bahamut the important thing is that we know now so we can prevent him from killing any other supreme beings or from mass murdering entire planar populations prevent him how every time we find new loophole in the rules so does he we ca nt even hit each other any more he can do anything he wants and there not single force in the multiverse that can stop him ringman entered the room behind them and watched for while not that you can really be behind anyone wearing robe of eyes that is not even omnion knew anything ridiculous swords telepathization continued there has to be reason for all this rather annoying clanking sound approached from the laundry room peter perfect emerged into their room carrying laundry basket as stiffly as he could manage with that adamantite full plate armor his stiffness and his monotone voice peter would have easily been mistaken for robot had robots been invented yet he set the basket down at disgusting sword feet here youaremaster er mistress imadesuretowashyourrobe ofthearchmagiinthesameloadastherestofthewhite clothes um thanks she said lifting the white robe out of the basket it crackled as she wrenched it free from its environment hmmmph thousand years of medieval advancement and they still had nt figured out way to get rid of static cling like was thinking ridiculous sword spake like ive been thinking ever since found out there has to be some reason the gods clammed up and somebody has to know it heck ringman interjected at this point it seems that the only person who know is the dungeon master ridiculous sword head sank back into her hands yeah know she sighed and ve even tried using the limited omniscience power of my artifacts to find out six times today alone but every time called up the dungeon master with that particular question got his answering machine it as though even the dm is keeping it hidden hey disgusting sword snapped her fingers maybe if you talked with the dungeon master facetoface the dm couldnt back down then and might have to tell you maybe ridiculous sword nodded solemnly ve thought of that myself but no one knows what the realm of the dungeon master is like no one in history has even seen the big referee and returned to tell about it you ca nt exactly jaunt over to his plane and chat with him because he does nt have plane in the usual sense of the term anybody who went to the dungeon master world would be outside of the multiverse as we know it and completely at the dm mercy still it does nt look like we have much choice jimmy had overheard too and was overjoyed he bounded into the room shouting oh boy you re gon na go visit the dungeon master can come along too always imagined the dm as this old guy wearing blackandwhite stripes with whistle stuck in his mouth no you ca nt come along ridiculous sword told him firmly you probably would nt survive for an attosecond and ve always imagined the dungeon master as female jailkeeper with huge keyring that locks and unlocks all these dungeon doors disgusting sword snorted that funny ve always seen him as this threefoothigh gnomelooking guy with long white hair huge bald spot red robes and cabbagepatch face whatever he looks like going to have to risk it ill take all my magic items and artifacts along with me of course if any of them work against me in his realm can always discard them it never hurts to have little insurance she paused if were nt paladin be really really scared paladin ringman said and still scared yeah but neither you nor can be affected by fear spell at least oh had nt thought of it that way ridiculous sword exhaled once resignedly and then once again decisively she hauled out her amulet of the planes she kicked in the vision spell from her ridiculous hand axe she cast commune contact other plane gate and an astral spell then rubbed herself down with some oil of etherealness she activated all six of her limited omniscience side effects at the same time and finally she chanted the mystic words brica bracker firecracker sis boom bah dungeon master dungeon master rah rah rah and the multiverse collapsed into big puddle around her the scene looked like the usual longanddrawnout plane travel special effects there were lots of pretty colors and weird music playing on 13thcentury synthesizer in the background she still felt her body clinging to the outside of her spirit just like always but she could nt see it not even with her permanent detect invisibility spell or her robe of eyes she felt very alone and very very helpless what will the dungeon master look like she tried to ask herself it was in trying to speak that she realized there was no air around her she was in vacuum even if there had been air out there she noticed she would nt have been able to breathe it oxygen or nitrogen would turn to ice the temperature was absolute zero her items and artifacts were doing very good job of keeping her alive then the pretty colors started to dim all lights and sounds however she could hear sound in vacuum were leaving her senses within six seconds it was absolute zero and absolute vacuum and absolute silent and absolute dark she felt an almost imperceptible jostle this is it she thought and as light and sound and temperature at last started to return her limbs as if of their own will began to pose in an awkward midstride stance they also started to stiffen her whole body even her head began hardening into mould which almost but did nt quite fit the normal contours of her body even her eyes became frozen in place fortunately her robe of eyes still afforded 360 degree view of things the first thing she could make out was white landscape perfectly flat white landscape as the details cleared she began to see thin blue lines networking the land crisscrossing in grid with each line spaced ten feet apart or ten yards she could nt be sure above the horizon loomed an eerily lit plastercovered wall that seemed to enclose several square miles on all four sides directly overhead was another wall this time with short stalactites hanging down from nearly every point any one of those stalactites could have been very short and fat piercer except for the fact that piercers did nt particularly care for bright light yellowishwhite sphere hung from the tremendous ceiling shining like an artificial sun it was then she noticed that the walls were nt plain there was gigantic wooden panel set into the flank side of the wall to the left of her with goldcolored cylinder jutting out of one side it looked rather remotely like mammoth door oh and there was one more detail in the room perhaps she had not wished to acknowledge its presence but there was something else there or someone else there someone whom she could no longer ignore someone who judging from the scale of the blue lines on the ground must have been 600 feet or yards tall the giant looked away from the papers in his hands and stared at ridiculous sword through his thick glasses his eyebrows lowered as he pointed at her you what are you doing here ridiculous sword could nt move her mouth to speak but she could still use telepathy you must be the dungeon master darned right the dungeon master he insisted setting some of his papers down and inadvertently dropping 20sided die brilliant deduction you do nt have 19 intelligence for nothing ridiculous sword glanced at her reflection in his spectacles she looked nothing like herself she was metallic gray adorned in lifeless mockery of magician robe she looked like metal statue of some girl wearing long robes and holding her hands in spellcasting position her feet rested on circular metal base half foot high and three feet wide in short she looked just as stiff and motionless as she felt you undoubtedly know why here great and powerful dungeon master of course know why you re here duuuuuuuuuuuuuh he whacked his right hand limply against the chest of his horizontallystriped tshirt you wan na find out more about gross sword well you little twit know everything there is to know about him he thumbed rapidly through the pages in his hand and whipped out yelloworange piece of parchment adorned with beautiful ink illumination and ugly pencil scratches do you recognize this he thrust it in her face ridiculous sword eyes tried to widen but could nt of course my character sheet exactly his mouth grew into sinister grin control your character sheet control he began the teensiest of rips along the top edge your destiny ridiculous sword felt terrible pain run across the rift on the top of her head she was having splitting headache feels terrible does nt it the dungeon master chortled you see know about all the ways you ve been stretching the rules honey distant feminine voice interrupted from beyond the door your dinner ready aw mom the dm yelled toward the door putting the character sheet down talkin with ridiculous sword well hurry it up the phantom voice replied the dungeon master turned back to his hapless audience of one as was saying know about how you wear five ten or even fifteen magic rings on single hand know about your percentile dice that are marked with zeroes on all the faces know about how you can buy magic items on the black magic market at cost know how you change character classes not once but ten times know his voice tried to grow more impressive how you kill centaurs and take their four onemilliongoldpiece gems so you want us to stop doing all that is that it she would have shivered nervously if she could move stop it are you kidding was the one who let you do all that in the first place he thrust finger right underneath her dull metal nose so that means you owe me does nt it let you types get away with plenty and you know what it was getting boring that right boring as hell or as the abyss or as tarterus or as whatever other plane you want to use in sentence why do you think let gross sword get 80 million experience points and be chaoticevil killing machine huh for play balance so thats why we could nt hit each other when we were fighting even though all our weapons had the final word power they do he picked up one of the sheets just beneath her character sheet wait minute they do do nt they so that would mean that each of you should have hit each other after the other person attacked played that wr er uh mean of course that why did it the dungeon master couldnt have let you kill each other then because because uh because still wanted tiamat to die but tiamat still er bahamut mean yeah that it had to have gross sword kill bahamut he picked her up off the white landscape and brought her to his eye level ridiculous sword robe of eyes told her that the white landscape she been standing on was actually tremendous sheet of parchment atop huge folding table and you ca nt do anything about it he turned her to face the circular receptacle standing in the corner shed already scanned it with her xray vision and knew it was full of crumpled documents there where sick sword is now see tore her in half nyaaah your mom is dead dead dead dead dead dead and burnt her character sheet so that not even scotch tape could bring her back er scotch what shut up you stupid puke and with that curse he hurled her back down at the white landscape she hit the ground so hard in fact that her spirit got jarred loose from the metal statue and she continued to fall through the table and into the darkness beyond what she emerged into looked like the astral plane it was nt the astral plane though as anyone who had really been there could tell you it was in fact the prime material plane yet she was not on central earth she was on her way to central earth though she found that out right quick yessirree just as soon as she saw the big bluewithwhitecloudspecks disk rush toward her at relativistic speed instantly she kicked in her permanent doublestrength potions of flying and levitation as her ring of earth elemental command automatically engaged its feather falling power that barely made dent in her speed the next instant she hit central earth atmosphere and would have burnt to cinder or plasma if not for artifact prime power dd that slowed her down somewhat but not enough she calculated to smack her into the ground subsonic she thought about teleporting upward to give her more time to slow down until she remembered that the ing rules did nt allow her to teleport anyplace where there was nt solid surface she watched helplessly as central earth rushed up to greet her the cloud layer zoomed toward and past her in the space of heartbeat normal heartbeat that is not the heartbeat of disgusting character under the influence of permanent potion of speed at twice normal strength she could see the gridlike division of landplots beneath her now they reminded her ironically of the blue lines on the dungeon master map the continental outline and the land patterns made her destination clear she was hurling down just outside of town aimed straight for her mother small keep from whence she gone to visit the dm in the first place she wished she had time to scan the castle with her xray vision just to see whether or not her physical body was still in there just to see if this wasnt some terrible falling nightmare she was going to wake up from in cold sweat but the wind and the pressure and the heat all felt far too real to her for it to be dream anyway and there was nt damned thing she could do to save herself from the fall the next instants flew by all too quickly she saw the keep explode into her visual field saw the east parapet heading straight toward her heard the loudest stony screech as her sight blacked out and felt an impact akin to someone hitting her with pillow the size of the astral plane she opened her eyes some six million microseconds later and glimpsed clear blue sky pierced by dark gray castle tower bird cheerful midday song accompanied the hurried approach of human or at least halfhuman footsteps ridiculous sword ringman voice neared from around corner are you still alive she craned her stiff neck forward and managed to look at jimmy astonished face she smiled weakly at him you musta been going supersonic when ya hit the ground jimmy relayed how come you did nt get splattered into zillion pieces she glanced to her left at the outer stone wall of the castle sevenodd feet away from her and understood she smiled at jimmy again and pointed at the masonry huh jimmy huhed oh get it disgusting sword said appearing virtually from out of nowhere you did nt take any damage because you fell within eight feet of wall ridiculous sword made the ok sign as if to say perfect and slumped back flat onto the ground this whole experience had just about taken everything out of her ringman arrived and knelt beside his second daughter the next moment when he realized that she come through totally unscathed as usual he asked what did you find out yeah jimmy enthused what the dungeon master look like ridiculous sword exhaled deeply he is the most nasty ruthless egotistical selfrighteous manipulative being it has ever been my displeasure to meet it makes me sick just to think that living in his multiverse disgusting sword blinked uncomfortably so did you find out anything about our dear beloved brother ridiculous sword nodded solemnly uh huh know why the dm wanted him to get away with being chaoticevil brat for so long and know what have to do part four sick sword memory still haunted ringman like isolde did tristan like juliet did romeo like thisby did pyramus like rock hudson did jim nabors like enough already ringman sneered we get the picture homer the brownie rode in back of ringman on his warhorse as usual disgusting sword and ridiculous sword floated through the air next to them peter perfect rode his own warhorse aside ringman holding the reins stiffarmed the horse seemed little uneasy about this whole setup as did prometheus jimmy lagged little behind everyone else staying clear of the horse trail of course swishing the sick sword menacingly through the air so what this big plan of yours rs jimmy asked yes ridiculous ringman inquired also like to know what we re about to get ourselves into so can decide whether or not should be afraid of it well ridiculous sword began the first thing we ve got to do is lure gross sword back out into the open that why we re heading for the great big clearing that happens to be even little bigger than the clearing sick sword built her keep in ah ringman ahed so there wo nt be any innocent bystanders for him to hack up no just to give us some maneuvering room oh by the way just remembered ringman you ve got ta upgrade your ballista plus wo nt hit anyone protected by doublestrength potion of invulnerability ringman buried his face in his right gauntlet aw do nt bother him about it disgusting sword told her peter perfect does nt have spoon of stirring anyway so tell us more about your plan why do nt you tell em sis do nt know your plan but you can read my mind not when you always have mind blank spell up oh all right ridiculous sword acquiesced anyway we get gross sword to come to us disgusting sword and will keep him occupied by meleeing him and not hitting meanwhile hell keep us occupied by meleeing us and not hitting and then she pointed to jimmy you hit him with secret weapon xj46 right jimmy grinned instinctively moving his left arm behind his back quizzically ringman looked behind jimmy back all he saw was left hand clutching air then the paladin fingered his own torso and decided think better keep this invulnerable coat of arnd on for the duration and that the whole plan homer complained hit him with secret weapon xj46 no escape routes no backups no ideas of what to do if gross sword still alive after your big lollapaloozer hits him oh he probably will be still alive after he hit ive already thought of that they reached the geometric center of the clearing and stopped ridiculous sword solemnly declared the time is right uh ringman interrupted do nt we have to wait for the three suns to align or something ridiculous sword grimaced at him central earth only has one sun sheish for paladin you sure have weak stomach you ready disgusting sword asked of everyone but of ridiculous sword in particular ridiculous sword nodded matter of factly ready jimmy smiled like little boy hiding secret im ready ringman and homer blinked at each other we re not ready good we re all in agreement then ridiculous sword declared she raised her horn of blasting into the wind and yelled through it groooooooooooss sword come out come out wherever you are the clearblue sky seemed to rumble reply as ridiculous sword put her horn away and both she and her sister began to cast the same spell what spell it was they were casting no one but they had any idea homer the brownie suddenly aware of his vulnerability in only having four hit points and positive armor class ran around behind ringman warhorse and blended in with the surroundings peter perfect of course just sat there stiffarmed on top of his horse ringman drew his merely holy longsword and raised his shield the air felt tense very tense ringman probably could have drawn spark by touching metal if he was nt grounded to his armor he wished to his deity that his daughters would hurry up and finish whatever spell it was they were casting then he saw it so did everyone else for that matter it was rather hard to miss six seconds ago the sky had been pure azure but now it was dominated by single gigantic swirling black cloud reaching all the way to the ground and into the center of the great big field out of the cone of this cyclone no hurricane was better word dropped the single most powerful force of chaoticevil in the multiverse and flanking him at ten yards intervals dropped four twelve foothigh humanoid machines golems ringman gasped ridiculous sword or disgusting sword could have told him that of course but they were still busy saying magic words and waving their arms around this scared homer even more and even jimmy and ringman warhorse began to get lumps in their stomachs though peter perfect of course just sat there in the saddle with his arms out stiff these golems were big and broad and darkcolored and noisy very noisy one solid clanking step from any of them could set off fault line ringman had slight feeling that he was outclassed uh ridiculous sword disgusting sword could you hurry it ha haaaaaah the boy in the middle gloated drawing attention back to himself as well as the gross broadsword and the gross hand axe his sandy brown hair framed dark hidden fury within his eyes but the whole of his expression drowned in his sinister sickening smile it was then that it dawned on ringman this was his son this was the first time he ever so much as seen his own boy it was also the first time gross sword had seen him for real even though he had probably spied on ringman countless times with crystal ball or mirror of mental prowess or whatnot so father the sinister smile mused as gross sword pulled out card number ten from the villain collection of commonly used sayings and held it up to display at last we meet he tromped with painstaking slowness toward ringman gross broadsword in right hand and gross hand axe in left relishing the everincreasing look of horror on his father face perhaps some dim flicker of conscience told him he should be paying more attention to his goodytwoshoes sisters but they were no threat and this paladin was far more entertaining the holy sword quavered in ringman hands and at that moment ridiculous sword and disgusting sword finished their spells by casting their hands toward the sky and crying the activating phrase tempuuuuuuuuuuuuus fugit if you thought the sick girls could move fast before you would have been flabberghasted to see them now their normal running speeds which were already only slightly under mach five now increased sixfold to monstrous 30 720 feet per second they could move six times as fast attack six times as fast cast spells six times as fast and even think six times as fast this was the awesome might that tempus fugit had bestowed upon them gross sword looked through his robe of eyes rear eyes at the two human cyclones now approaching him god iv he gasped how could have overlooked such powerful spell ringman wiped his brow grateful that his murderous sons attention had been drawn from him he stopped relaxing though when he realized that the four golems had nt been so distracted gross sword assessed things as quickly as he could manage ridiculous blur and disgusting blur would probably use their speed to try and feint past his defenses he would have to keep his guard up more now than ever before in his life the only way he could hope for betterthanaverage odds of survival would be to cringe parry without attacking he swallowed his pride and went on the defensive ridiculous sword reached him first she had been nearer to him when she finished her spell gross sword crossed his broadsword and handaxe and readied to kick in his helm of teleportation if it came to that and then when ridiculous sword closed to within ten feet of him she she slowed down she slowed to her usual ridiculouslyfast pace instead of the unbelievablyfast pace she just had puzzled but delighted gross sword looked at disgusting sword and found that she had slowed down to below hypersonic as well and his father behind him and the four golems they looked to be moving six times more lethargically than they had any right to now he remembered tempus fugit affected everything within ten feet of its caster friend or foe ringman hardly noticed his son and daughters little skirmish twelve feet of mindless metal was about to pound him into the ground like tent peg he would have to hit it first he charged up the few remaining yards to the behemoth shouting to drown out his fear and rammed his holy sword toward its metal belly he was in midswing too late to stop the momentum of his blow or the momentum of his thoughts when he realized exactly what kind of metal this golem was made of the sword tip impacted into an impenetrable wall it arched under the weight of ringman thrust protested and finally snapped in two the upper half of the blade clattered down soundlessly against the grassy earth ringman stared in horror at the half of sword remaining in his right hand then slowly turned to the golem and exclaimed you have broken what could not be broken am pure adamantite the golem replied that is substance your holy sword was only that was why it broke ringman nested his face in one hand and shook his head this has been recorded announcement the golem finished and smashed down on ringman so hard it knocked him to the ground ringman rolled out of the creature way and stood up just being stepped on by that thing would probably squish him mithralalloyed armor and all the adamantite golem stumbled harmlessly by leaving sixinchdeep footprints ringman figured he might be able to keep its attention for few minutes but then it might lose interest and turn instead on homer or jimmy or his warhorse he needed to down this thing and he needed weapon to do it he looked over at jimmy he had broadsword he was also using that broadsword to fend off one of the other three adamantite golems ringman certainly could nt take that sword from jimmy even if he could stomach taking the sick sword into his hand again ridiculous sword and disgusting sword also had broadswords and daggers and longswords and hand axes and all eight of them were either in their hands or dancing in the air to keep gross sword attention and gross sword probably would nt be willing to forfeit any of his weapons to ringman just yet where on central earth could he find wea the green glow from peter perfect hip almost seemed to respond to his thoughts that poorexcuseforaholysword had told him that peter perfect had paid the extra 20 000 gold pieces to upgrade it to no ringman convinced himself aloud no no way unuh no absolutely not the golem clanked toward him again oh hell he said reached over and drew the sentient holy avenger longsword from peter perfect sheath the sword was as perky as holy puppy dog ringman old buddy old pal old pal old pal so ya finally changed your mind ringman pointed threatening finger at the sword one snide remark prometheus and ll find way to break you too prometheus shrugged in that way only holy swords can my personality score higher than yours the golem was nearly upon them fine barked ringman for now just do what you do best thought you never ask prometheus replied and in concert with ringman strong right arm rammed its tip right through the adamantite golem belly ouch the golem commented ringman yanked the sword out of his opponent and swung again making deep gash in the metal giant side it was hurt pretty badly now two attacks per minute prometheus commented impressed new paladin rules ringman replied as he deflected another swing of that adamantite arm with his shield longsword happens to be my weapon of choice ringman hacked twice at the behemoth again this mountain of adamantite was doomed to fall ringman could be sure of that nearby jimmy was disposing of his adamantite golem in classic fashion he could nt attack as often as ringman could since he was only firstlevel but with the sick sword in his hands he could hit just as hard if not 10 damage points harder the third and fourth golems surprisingly were already mangled heaps of metal filings lying on the ground disgusting sword figured maybe she did nt need both her disgusting dagger and her disgusting broadsword hacking futilely at gross sword at the same time so she sent the dagger off to tackle the golems during one of its fourminute dancing episodes all this time gross sword and the sick girls had been hacking at each other and at each others dancing weapons with absolutely no result gross sword could have sworn that disgusting sword had only been armor class 27 last time he saw her which was certainly weak enough ac for him to penetrate could have sworn you were only armor class 27 last time saw you disgusting sword gross sword said breaking their silence was disgusting sword told him as she parried and riposted her riposte missed of course look at my stones gross sword quickly counted and assimilated the tiny baubles whirling around disgusting sword head sure enough there were eighteen dusty rose stones in orbit about her that had nt been there before oh he said see eighteen 1protection ioun stones to bring your armor class down to 45 you re almost as cheap as am jimmy chopped down on his golem for the final time the humanoid lump of adamantite gave nondescript grunt and keeled over all right jimmy cheered got one uh iiiiiiiiiiiiiii aaaaagh jimmy too keeled over holding his stomach he looked like he was about to explode ringman saw this and rushed to his side taking off his gauntlets in case he needed to lay on his hands what wrong son gross sword glanced over at him when he heard that but it was nt he who his father was asking merely ridiculous swords new playmate whom ringman had fleetingly called son ridiculous sword looked over at jimmy and smiled she knew what was going on jimmy unfortunately did not he felt like the time his strength had suddenly climbed from 18 to 1800 only about hundred times worse and in all the wrong places he shook he held his throbbing temples he bubbled over he imagined himself turning inside out when at last the feeling ebbed and his stomach returned to his belly he noticed the last fading traces of bluish aura around him he would have noticed it while he was changing except he had more important things to worry about then that adamantite golem got you 26 700 experience points jimmy ridiculous sword called out welcome to level five oh no jimmy shook his head this was just too much he was grateful that he had migraine headache so that he could hold his head and feel something familiar gross sword gross swords clanged and clashed against disgusting sword and ridiculous sword invincible defenses his airborne dancing weapons parried theirs like bats out of the abyss there must be some way to end this stalemate gross sword figured there must be some power say that his weapons could drum up his broadsword his hand axe his long sword and his dagger were all unholy dancing defender flametongue frost brand antisun blades of wounding sharpness throwing thunderbolts life stealing venom contradisruption all dragon slaying speed final hey wait millisecond gross sword barked how come my weapons final word power never kicked in was waiting for you to mention that ridiculous sword said with wide grin she cocked her right arm back put every ounce of atlas strength she had into the swing and hacked mighty blow at her nemesis with the ridiculous broadsword gross sword threw everything he had into the sword way even his weapons full defender abilities but it could nt stop the blade razorsharp adamantite tore across his abdomen like thunder boosted by the limitless strength in ridiculous swords arm and the bracer of irresistible damage around her left wrist when the smoke cleared gross sword was down 330 hit points aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh gross sword wailed he backed up blinded by searing pain like he had never felt before in his life his eyes were full of reflexive tears when he looked back up how in the name of demogorgon ghost did you do that easy ridiculous sword explained had feeling the dungeon master would forget about our weapons final word powers just like he did the last time we fought was just waiting for you to remind him the dungeon master gross sword words flowed out as slowly as pitch the dungeon master forgot ridiculous sword merely halfsmiled back then gross sword figured then my swords final word powers should work on you too he started to swing his broadsword maybe ridiculous sword replied turned around and ran but you have to catch me first gross sword gave chase he ran after her for nearly tenth of second before he realized that she was outdistancing him sixtoone damn it her tempus fugit field moved with her when she ran away she left gross sword out in the cold and disgusting sword had already put fair distance between herself and her dear little brother gross sword sheathed his broadsword and his hand axe can fix that he muttered he inhaled deeply wiggled his fingers and began to chant the chant was an illusionist spell fifthlevel illusionist spell he had memorized tempus fugit just like his sisters had he just had nt been sure of what the spell could do that was all sword and dagger buzzed through the air toward him at blinding speeds they were ridiculous sword damn her dancing weapons one hit from one of those things backed up by her bracer of irresistible damage would be enough to finish him off in his current state of health he only had 279 hit points left there was nothing he could do except abort his spell and run backwards until he was out of the dancing weapons 30 yard range so reasoning he aborted his spell and ran backwards until he was out of the dancing weapons 30 yard range disgusting sword was nt about to let him out of her clutches so easily after all the old grosser might still have another tempus fugit spell memorized she ran around behind him and charged with her dancing holy longsword of wounding and her dancing holy hand axe of wounding gross sword saw the disembodied weapons coming he was wearing rode of eyes after all and parried them with the gross broadsword and the gross dagger the weapons did nt stand chance of hitting poor old disgusting sword was born too soon to put the final word ability on her toys but still they hacked and thrusted and slashed six times faster than they had any right to what gives gross sword said fending off her dancing weapons they had certainly been confusing the hell out of him all this time your dancing weapons are nt inside of tempus fugit field they do nt have to be disgusting sword called back dancing weapons fight with exactly the same expertise and power as their wielder and since im in tempus fugit field gross sword slapped palm over his face while still parrying with the other hand of course that has to be the most ridiculous distortion of the rules ve ever heard of he exclaimed ridiculous or not it was there and being implemented and any second now ridiculous sword weapons could catch up with him and deliver the final word he was at dangerous disadvantage there was only one option open to him he grit his teeth swallowed his pride which was very large gulp and declared tactical advance to the rear then he teleported or at least he tried to teleport neither the ether nor the astral plane would accept him he bounced off of the fabric of the multiverse in purplish haze and snapped right back to his point of origin what gross sword winced ridiculous sword grinned you do nt think we chose this particular clearing by accident do you certain areas of central earth such as this place and the cracks of doom are inherently teleportproof you ve just walked right into our trap gross sword grimaced then pulled out his last ace oh yeah he breathed well there one other trick have left he grinned which you did nt count on he moved his hands to the sky and his sisters recognized the gesture oh no the sword sisters gasped in unison gross sword snickered evilly finished his somatic components with groin thrust and chanted the mystic words antimagic shell ringman stared on in awe as an invisible sphere 49 feet across englobed his son even he knew what that spell could do no magic item would function within its confines not single one nor would any of the sick kids permanent spells however ringman did recall his dearly departed sick sword once saying something about artifacts he yelped pointing at gross sword your artifacts can still work inside the shell ridiculous sword disgusting sword and yes even gross sword all turned to their father and grudgingly told him in chorus not any more they ca nt ridiculous sword beamed him telepathic picture of dragon and dragrace latest issue page 23 paragraph the paragraph read the dungeon master the most lordly and highest creator of all the multiverse and the most incredibly omnipotent of any of you jerkoffs out there hereby declare that antimagic shells will now stop the effects of artifacts and relics as well as the effects of nonartifact magic items like they were supposed to do in the first place furthermore magic potions imbibed before the antimagic shell touches the imbiber will function normally in no way is this statement to be assumed an admission of dungeon master error oh ringman shrugged the scene fell silent gross sword had summoned in the ultimate defense ha ha he chortled chaoticevilly my defensive powers still work but your offensive powers do not your little trick has nt availed you at all my dear sisters and now that know about this spot and about tempus fugit you ll never be able to trick me again bwa ha ha ha haaaa jimmy shook his head and looked at ringman who was standing less than ten yards away dunno it that evil laugh that gets me that evil laugh that old bwahaha that was something peter perfect had always wanted to do if evil laughter was nt prohibited by that darned code of paladinhood he he something snapped something that only peter perfect could hear it was no louder than blade of grass dying of thirst or bottle of fresh milk evaporating but it was like thunder compared with the boundless silence that had been numbing peter perfect consciousness that evil laugh had brought him to the surface and allowed him to make another saving throw against the charm he was under and this time with the help of the magic items the sick sisters had given back to him he made it he felt his warhorse familiar adamantite saddle underneath him the saddle sores felt welcome indeed he surveyed his situation gross sword was chortling up storm inside of an antimagic shell the way peter had always wanted to do ridiculous sword and disgusting sword were standing there pondering their next move jimmy was holding the sick sword in his right hand and concealing his left behind his back and pretending to be something more than he was homer the brownie was hiding behind ringman warhorse and ringman staring in awe at the fray or lack thereof was wielding his own dear prometheus he was about to charge over and snatch the holy sword from his rival hands but his combat sense stopped him the sick kids would mash him to bits if they knew he was up and around he could nt let them know he put his arms out stiffly in front of him as they had been when he was charmed and hoped that ridiculous sword and disgusting sword were too busy to tune in to his wavelength prometheus his thoughts cried startled the holy sword twitched in ringman hand fortunately for prometheus ringman was too preoccupied to notice hear you the longsword transmitted telepathically when tell you too peter perfect continued without flinching leap into my hand when tell you to gotcha the sword replied it nice to hear from you again yeah yeah whatever neither of the sick girls turned their attention to him good he watched and waited gross sword raised his voice demand one billion gold pieces in small coins and safe passage out of this land gold pieces ridiculous sword asked what would you want with money oh yeah gross sword corrected himself that was just something heard on one of those old latenight precognitions but still demand safe passage out of this land or ll kill each and every living thing within thirty miles and you wo nt be able to stop me oh we wo nt will we ridiculous sword grin grew as wide today as it ever would jimmy it time jimmy almost lost control with excitement he pulled his longconcealed left hand out from behind his back to reveal secret weapon xj46 he yelled glinting the secret weapon in the sunlight ballista of automatic missile fire disgusting sword and ridiculous sword whipped out their ollamh harps and strummed an incredibly triumphantly dramatic chord jimmy continued and ballista targets and now everyone joined in except for peter perfect who was still pretending to be charmed are armor class ten if exposed to sight gross sword cringed at the oversized crossbow sitting on jimmy shoulder at the chain feeding into it each link of that chain held missile the size of javelin with the punch of small house he wanted to fireball that kid as fast as he could or iceball him or lightningball him or sonicball him or whatever he was nt immune to through the sick sword he carried in his other hand but to launch any such attack on him gross sword would first have to lower his antimagic shell and that would leave ridiculous sword finalword weapons open to reduce him to chowder there had to be some other way for him to remain invulnerab ha haaah gross sword suddenly recalled my permanent doublestrength potion of invulnerability is nt affected by the antimagic shell you still need or better weapon to hit me with but since every weapon that comes near me gets rendered nonmagical you wo nt be able to hit me at all not so jimmy replied in the most majestic tone of voice he had ever used ridiculous sword had planned for just such comeuppance and had given him one final contingency your invulnerability requires your opponents to have weapon of at least or hit dice of 62 or greater gross sword shook finger at him no no no no ve read page 75 of the book of infinite wisdom myself and the footnote specifically states that this does not apply to characters of any sort jimmy grinned but it does apply to monsters he flexed his neurons in concentration and kicked in his permanent potion of polymorph self startling transformation occurred two seconds later he stood before his gross foe as hill giant hill giant with ballista of automatic missile fire hill giant with eight hit dice plus one to two additional hit points character with lots of hit dice might not be able to hit someone who invulnerable even if he shooting at him with ballista jimmy explained in hillgiantish voice but monster with lots of hit dice firing ballista at him can he pulled the trigger and tore the sky apart the weapons catapultstring twanged back and forth accepting and releasing its javelinsized loads with an unearthly speed all its own shot after shot filled each deadly second with over dozen missiles none of which failed to strike home gross sword cringed under the onslaught as the shafts riddled his body ignoring his permanent doublestrength invulnerability and all common sense and he could nt heal himself none of his clerical healing spells or magical wish spells or vampiric rings of regeneration would work unless he dropped the protection of his magicproof sphere and lowering his only lastditch defense would leave him wide open to ridiculous sword weapons final word attacks slaughtered or shishkabobbed one was hardly different from the other his psionic cell adjustment ability would only heal couple hundred hit points of damage before he exhausted his psionic power point reserve his monk ability of missile deflection was useless against siege missiles like the ones that were puncturing his body at that instant and he couldnt teleport gross sword was down to four hundred hit points and dropping fast three hundred hit points he still could nt teleport two hundred hit points the supply of missiles going into that ballista still seemed endless one hundred hit points instinctively he cowered behind his own arms which were also impaled weak flesh weak weak weak all his special training all those experience points all those artifacts he collected to make him indestructible came to nothing now he was as naked as when he was first born as naked as in the womb before his birth as naked as when tiamat seed of evil had first infected him fiftythree hit points he looked up looked around for salvation jimmy hillgiantish eyes were merciless his sisters played their ollamh lutes with mounting tension only ringman among the onlookers seemed deeply concerned gross sword paladin father bit the knuckle of one of his gauntlets and shook his head with impending sorrow father fortyfive hit points twentyeight twelve stoooooooooooooooooooooooooooop jimmy released the trigger on impulse everyone froze the music ceased gross sword scream left wake gulf of deafening silence and the mightiest force of chaos and evil in the multiverse collapsed onto his knees and cried mphg he sobbed into his hands ahuc ahuc ahuc whwh whwhat what ve done what have done ringman started to stride toward him feeling urgent no no ringman jimmy warned him he still dangerous nononononononononono homer the brownie called out to the ninthlevel bythebook paladin shaking his head wildly with each syllable ringman ignored their warnings and sauntered toward his son he took his gauntlets off within the first ten yards then his helmet then his greaves then the invulnerable coat of arnd armorless completely defenseless he knelt down by his only male child gross sword looked up at him out of his hands then buried his reddened eyes right back into his hands again of course that did nt keep him from seeing anything because he still had on his robe of eyes he shook his head and nearly flung off his tears then slowly he looked back into the eyes of his father once more he lowered his right hand ringman grasped it gross sword shook his head more slowly with furrowed brow mom he winced bahamut all of the people and non people they did nt deserve it they did nt do anything anything to deserve what did to them he inhaled sharply why did pollute all their lives why why in hells name did nt listen to the last generation of disgusting characters when they told me about tiamat seed of evil tiamat evil seed peter perfect thought that was my doing hah revenge never felt so good as that time all the other onlookers were thoroughly distracted it was not yet time to leap into action but it would nt hurt to get into better position he nudged his warhorse ever so subtly with an invisible squeeze from his legs and the mount trotted slowly and nonchalantly toward gross sword and ringman oblivious to peter and still presuming him to be charmed ridiculous sword and disgusting sword also made way toward their brother he saw them coming and lowered his antimagic shield more barriers were the last things he needed right now this gross sword went on pouring out more than nine years worth of misery this was all wrong damn it only felt satisfied whenever did something sadistic and every victory was as hollow as the ones before it all those people hurt or killed all with lives and loves of their own he looked into his father eyes they were nearly as red as his own oh dad he sobbed clutching him why do that to you and mom ringman embraced him back he could barely breathe straight his feelings so choked him in all senses of the words he had finally met his son gross sword broke the hug and looked into ringman eyes again ringman nodded weeping with joy gross sword think can be really proud of you now gross sword shook his head unable to accept it proud of mass murderer tyrant proud of bahamut and his mothers your love killer proud of the being who could have set the whole multiverse back five thousand years and ringman could nt accept that either was proud of you he admitted from the time first heard you were born they hugged each other again and sat that way for long long time of all the spectators present prometheus was the only one who was the slightest bit agitated now the holy sword begged telepathically no peter perfect returned not yet then when soon all right peter thoughts barked geez youre more impatient than am but wan na kill something the sword pouted peter was tempted to bury his eyes in his hand and shake his head but that would have given him away he stood firm as always arms still out stiff and waited the moment would come gross sword loosened his tearful embrace and looked down at his own waist four adamantite belt loops jutted out from his bluejeans of free action these loops housed the hafts and blades of the four grossest chaoticevil weapons in all the multiverse the gross hand axe the gross longsword the gross dagger and most powerful of all the gross broadsword four weapons devoted solely to spreading limitless evil and chaos through whoever chose to wield them their overwhelming power had been his idea and his alone nothing he had figured could withstand the might of an antiranger and antipaladin who used those those no he blurted startling everyone there because he still had his mind blank spell up and they could nt read his mind he stood up do nt care what powers those two classes give me do nt want to be an antipaladin or an antiranger any more the heavens rebuked well actually it was the abysses that rebuked but you get the idea and gross sword the only son of sick sword and ringman gave up the powers of the anti paladin and the antiranger even ridiculous sword was impressed wow she uttered finding it difficult to pick the right words now now you re only plain average runofthemill psionic druidmonkassassinthiefbardillusionistclericmagicuser weapons master gross sword nodded solemnly his eyes still wet know terrible loss but no price is too high now what guy disgusting sword whispered with utmost sincerity into her sister ear dont want to be some unholy force anymore gross sword continued dont want to be evil and dont want these damned sentient weapons polluting the multiverse anymore he snapped the gross longsword and the gross dagger out of their loopscabbards and hurled them to the grassy ground where they impaled themselves pointfirst in the earth without another though he followed up with the gross broadsword and the gross hand axe thwunking the broadsword into the ground just as he had the other two weapons but hurling the axe edgefirst into the soil beside them he flung the gross pair of gloves off of his hands and down next to the blades then drew the other gross pair of gloves from their holsters and cast them away that was twice he hurled down the gauntlet in as many instants he inhaled vehemently gon na have you six destroyed the six weapons erupted in light and shone directly on their owner his robe of eyes was blinded but he was nt of course you can not destroy us the gross weapons boomed together as one we are artifacts you yourself created us as more than mere sentient magic weapons we can not be destroyed ridiculous sword chuckled for few seconds then broke into roaring laughter ha ha ha ha ha she addressed the gross artifacts you do nt think so do you she reached into her last portable hole and rummaged for tiny object she been awaiting this day ever since her brother created those weapons in the first place at last she pulled out the one thing she had prepared specifically for this event it looked like one of those snaplidded velvet cases that diamond rings come in disgusting sword clasped her chest and beheld the box in splendid wonder ringman and jimmy scratched their heads and beheld the box in utter confusion homer the brownie did nt know what in sick sword name was going on but he was enjoying this whole show more and more the front of the box was engraved in block lettering with simply the ant box ridiculous sword flipped the box open all right you gross toasties she exclaimed it time for you to meet the humble ant aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh the gross weapons screamed the centimeterlong black ant in the box lethargically lifted its eyes up to ridiculous sword and said in that language spoken only by antkind think you ought to know im feeling very depressed she picked the ant up on her right index finger never mind that she replied in antspeak have task for you wo nt enjoy it the ant informed her not asking you to enjoy it ridiculous sword told it just want you to step on those chaoticevil artifact weapons gasp the gross weapons gasped you want me to go step on some artifacts the ant groaned here am brain the size of pinhead and you want me to go step on some artifacts probably be the biggest load on my intellectual capacities today for humble ant jimmy sidetalked to homer the brownie he sure has one pompous ego ridiculous sword lowered the ant toward the weapons disdaining his task the ant grudgingly crawled down from her left index finger and trudged toward its quarry it reached the other gross pair of gloves first arrrrrrrrrgh the gloves screamed nooooo do nt send me back to the void the ant stepped there was crack where its foot came down and in flash of bluewhite light the gloves crumbled to dust the ant looked down at his work and moaned not getting you down at all am and since the gross pair of gloves was nearest to where the other gross pair of gloves had been that was the humble ants next target he walked toward it in that way that only humble ants can nononononono the gross pair of gloves wailed whwhat have ever done to you have this terrible pain down all the formic acid ducts on my lefthand side he said with disdain and destroyed the second of the gross weapons how does that ant manage to destroy both gloves at once by stepping on one of them disgusting sword wondered gross sword smiled and nodded in revelationlike gratitude as the ant approached the gross hand axe the axe was nt quite as receptive uh er ah that is uh call this job satisfaction the ant asked rhetorically and stepped on the axe head the head broke in half and released its essence back into the etheric ocean cause do nt it approached the gross longsword the weapon shivered with fright it was nt enjoyable at all what with being locked up in that box all the time the ant told it the first ten million years were the worst and the second million years they were the worst too the third ten million years did nt enjoy at all after that went into bit of decline bbbbbbbbbbbbut now you re out of the box the sword argued you can get away from all this and live your own life life the ant bellowed no one present had any idea that an ant voice could get that loud he crunched down solidly on the blade and broke it forever in twain do nt talk to me about life two gross weapons remained the gross broadsword and the gross dagger were all that remained of gross sword old evil the ant approached the dagger and the blade bargained for its life hey ant maybe we can make deal just claim me for your own and can give you well power beyond your wildest imaginings sounds awful the ant replied and snapped the life out of this blade to boot whoo peter perfect thought some ant glad prometheus is nt an artifact weapon and now it came down to the gross broadsword gross sword number one weapon throughout his entire disgusting career the ant treaded his way toward its quarry as before but the gross sword did nt flinch it did nt cry out on fear it did nt beg for its life it just sat there in an act of greatest contempt the ant said nothing either and just stepped on the blade and nothing happened it stepped again again nothing it stepped harder still nothing the ant looked solemnly up at ridiculous sword and complained hmmmph you seem to have miscalculated ha haaaaah the broadsword cheered knew it knew it was gross sword favorite you see was much too valuable to have the foot of humble ant be the means of my destruction ridiculous sword smirked you re right being stepped on by an ant is nt the way you were designed to be destroyed you gross broadsword can only be destroyed she cast gate spell by him through the purple glow of the gate stepped the most monstrous humanoid being any of them had ever seen it towered 48 feet in the air and had skin of solid iron the very air shook in his vicinity the being of iron stared down balefully at the bunch gathered before him and bellowed who summons me ridiculous sword stepped forward and nonchalantly pointed at the gross sword that was still on the ground step on that artifact she instructed him the being eyes grew wide with anger you child you dare summon talos for such middling er such middling uh er he recognized her er uh duh um ooh eeh ah ah oh please do nt kill me ridiculous sword have wife and seventytwo hundred children only three thousand years old too young to diiiiiiiiie ridiculous sword shrugged her shoulders then step on that artifact talos nodded meekly the gross broadsword knew what was coming next and it was nt going to take it lying down using its telekinetic ability along with its flight power and some of its unused minutes of being dancing weapon the broadsword leapt up and out of stomping range of the triple iron golem oh no ya do nt the sword barked you re not getting rid of me this easily without word ridiculous sword rushed up to the gross broadsword and plucked it from the air the sword vibrated in her hand as it tried to escape let go of me the sword was trying to dominate her ego futile attempt but it tried anyway she forced it down onto the ground step talos she said with infinite calm the iron giant put its foot down on the sword that is it tried to put its foot down on the sword but the sword jerked itself out of the way it the last instant even in ridiculous sword atlasstrength grasp it was nt totally immobile talos stepped again but again the sword evaded the giant iron foot everyone attention was on talos and the gross broadsword the time was perfect peter perfect vaulted off his warhorses adamantite saddle tumbled across the ground to an upright position and in all the confusion made it to gross sword side before even his robeofeyesassisted vision could warn him he had his hand around the artifact bracelet on his left wrist and had yanked it off before gross sword even reacted now prometheus he shouted ringman looked down at his hilt just as prometheus pulled itself free the sword landed gripfirst in peter perfect right hand hahahahahahahahaha peter guffawed now have the power and with that he engaged the helm of teleportation which disgusting sword and ridiculous sword had seen no harm in leaving on his head glowed purple for moment and vanished the gross broadsword was so stunned in fact it did nt even see talos foot coming down and it died in fit of breakage mmay go now the triple iron golem asked yeah sure sure ridiculous sword waved him away not even bothering to look straight at him talos went back through the gate and both disappeared peter perfect was nt even charmed disgusting sword said with disgust he fooled us yeah gross sword noticed and how the hell did he manage to do what he just did in teleportfree zone hell ridiculous sword cast thumb over her shoulder that gate made should nt even have worked teleportation of any kind is supposed to be prohibited in this region she cast her eyes skyward but guess the dungeon master forgot about that little detail the skies rumbled once more and searing blue bolt of pure damage hurled down from the heavens and struck ridiculous sword squarely none of her magic items of protection could defend her from that murderous bolt as it was thrown directly from the dungeon master hand ridiculous sword body lay there in fried heap ridiculous sword ringman screamed and knelt down beside her oh my deity and then ten seconds after her death occurred ridiculous sword stirred and shook herself back to consciousness mmmm hi dad she said ringman scratched his head in utter confusion but but how did easy his younger daughter told him propping herself up on her elbows was dead right sent to heaven right well all had to do was cast raise dead spell on myself and poof here am this is one hell of crazy multiverse ringman mumbled hey he noted thought raise dead was minute spell it is ridiculous sword came back regaining more and more of her composure with each second tempus fugit still up and we can still catch peter perfect but how jimmy asked joining them where did he go yeah gross sword commented tried to pick him up on clairvoyance just now but all got was snow he still mindblanked all right then ridiculous sword figured if you were megalomaniacal paladin what would you most want to do take over the world jimmy said ridiculous sword winked at him right and if you could nt take over the world then what ringman rubbed his chin then said you want to destroy it uh huh and that most likely what he set out to do destroy the world disgusting sword puzzled before we can find out about it right disgusting sword had revelation ohhhhhhhh all right ridiculous sword drew breath hang on to my coat tails jimmy you homer ride with disgusting sword and gross sword you take dad okay ringman did not catch this at all wait wait minute where are we going by the time he said we gross sword already had him on his back and homer and jimmy had already mounted up ridiculous sword leapt into the air and told him to the basement of the world the clearing whooshed by beneath them soon they were passing over forests and towns and then lakes and finally wide ocean ringman was still confused and where is this basement of the world where else ridiculous sword chuckled on the bottom side of central earth ringman mouthed the words bottom side then asked you mean it flat sure what did you think it was anyway round hah wed all fall off then well that makes sense homer the brownie concurred the ocean passed serenely beneath them soon the blue of the sky faded to black velvet backdrop against which the stars shone more brightly than they ever did at night they were reaching the edge ringman pointed helplessly as the boundary of central earth circular but so vast that up close it looked straight rushed by beneath them and they were in free space whoa ringman moaned feeling uneasily giddy whoa this feels weird we re weightless now disgusting sword informed him that what happens whenever you leave the plate ringman nodded ll remember that next time happen to come here ridiculous sword dipped down not that down had any real meaning anymore and swung past the edge ringman looked forward and saw the stars in their sphere of perfectly hard ether swoop past over his shoulder the dirt and rock of the edge obscured more and more of the bluecapped top of that beautiful world and at last the bottom reached his view the bottom was nothing like the bluelit majesty of the top it was in deep night now and would be until the sun set and passed its light from the world above to the world below yet even by the dim light of the stars alone ringman could make out the contours it was rough and craggy dripping with stalactites of rock and dirt there was no living sound not even the breath of life only hollow echo of their swift passage through this other world the hanging peaks passed above him and he realized that they were indeed above him back under the plate gravity had returned homer of course merely hung on for dear life through all of this their course hugged the mountainbottoms and aimed straight for the other side of the world in this space without blue air the other side could clearly be seen even though its true size was impossible to grasp but it was not the opposite side of the plate that was their goal it was the center ringman peered with as keen an undisgusting eye as he could manage and saw it he was the first nondisgusting character in the history of central earth to see it tiny tiny thread stretched down from the center of the world and lost itself in the unfathomable depths below the north pole of central earth that was the axis along which the plate rested the reference point that indicated which direction down was that thread ridiculous sword told him is called the thread of gravity it what generates our weight on central earth without that everything would float off into free space jimmy scratched his head he had only been disgusting for few weeks and had nt learned everything yet so then that means that the plate itself should weigh something also ridiculous sword nodded that right it does so then ringman interjected what holding it up atlas the sick kids said in chorus finally it all started to dawn to ringman atlas had the job of holding up central earth if peter perfect wanted to destroy the whole world his best bet would be to get rid of the pillar that was holding it up that would be atlas that was why he took the other bracer of irresistible damage from gross sword to begin with the center of central earth came closer and closer into view ringman could make out tiny silhouette on the end of the thread pushed right up against the plate it was humanoid silhouette no two humanoid silhouettes at last ridiculous sword cast continual light spell on the nearest stalactite and illuminated the situation in both senses of the words atlas who was no larger than your average greek athlete was still holding up central earth but just barely terrible wounds more than justified the exhaustion in his eyes and face his feet could barely keep their grip on the thread next to the teetering titan stood grinning peter perfect waving prometheus to exalt the blood that now stained it he had wanted them to catch up with him to see his moment of triumph ridiculous sword levitated herself up to the bottom of central earth and used the inverted surface to run toward him at her full running speed peter perfect put up restraining hand and stepped to atlas side ridiculous sword stopped herself prometheus went down so that it just covered the worldholder throat and the other bracer of irresistible damage around peter wrist pulsed in bluewhite readiness one more step sick kids the disgusting paladin announced and atlas here gets it hoo boy ringman thought jimmy thoughts ran along the same lines homer was too frightened to think gross sword looked him levelly in the eye he never did like this poor excuse for paladin but now his dislike for him was for different reasons you do nt really want to do this gross sword said to him peter perfect did take what do you mean do nt want to do this of course want to do this you want to destroy everything on central earth just because you ca nt have it all gross sword put to him darned right peter exclaimed stupid old world what did it ever do for me anyways and besides you people seem so attached to this miserable little planet full of so much vile filth and sin and nasty other things that we paladins are out to destroy that if you do nt agree to give me total control over all beings on this planet ll snuff out atlas right here and now and what would you do with total control gross sword pressed on what would do with it why rule over it of course you mean play with it as you pleased exactly like toy whose only purpose was to amuse you yeah and you call yourself lawfulgood paladin gross sword and ringman asked at the same time peter perfect eyes darted worriedly to either side he still felt like he had his paladin powers sort of did nt he he shook his head and with utter contempt slashed the last slash across atlas neck after the other bracer of irresistible damage his titan strength the axe of the dwarvish lords weapon damage bonus the causeseriouswoundsbytouch power of the talisman of alakbar and prometheus own magical bonus he ended up doing 242 damage points killing the titanwhoholdsuptheworld instantly and inflicting temporary paralysis on him to boot and amid gaping horrors central earth fell no earthquake could match what happened on the plate upper surface no words can describe the sudden and inexplicable loss of weight that everything thereon experienced on world that had grown up with and evolved everything it had into the concept of gravity for over four billion years freefall was simply not within the realm of understanding nor would it be for long as it was gravity task also to hold the blue air to the surface of the world and as it fell it landed on something something that was already in freefall peter perfect the blow was nothing more than the force of say walking across room and not stopping before you ran into the wall not enough to hurt anyone not normally but the book of infinite wisdom or perhaps it was necessary realitybuilding article in dragon dragrace made stipulation about that it said that whenever solid object lands on somebody else that object does certain number of d6 worth of damage for every hundred pounds it weighs central earth weighed six billion trillion tons and since there was at least little mithral that had nt yet been mined out of its crust it was considered or better weapon with regard to what kinds of creatures it could affect peter perfects permanent potion of invulnerability thus rendered useless he and even his adamantite full plate armor were squished into an unrecognizable bloody wetspot mile across gee jimmy commented he did nt even say goodbye yeah ringman noted now in freefall himself but that did nt keep central earth from falling somebody got to catch it disgusting sword commented who be strong enough ringman asked somebody as strong as atlas ridiculous sword replied nonchalantly do nt forget who you re in the company of ridiculous sword flexed her 25 strength muscles and prepared to halt the falling slab but gross sword slid in ahead of her he braced his atlasstrength legs against the thread that was the north pole held up his atlasstrength hands and with calming breath and about three inches off leeway he brought the world to stop having weight return to the people up top so abruptly was almost as big shock as having it leave in the first place massive property damage ensued and most everyone was severely shaken up but fortunately no one was hurt ridiculous sword caught her falling father with ease not taking her eyes from her brother gross sword stood there holding up the world between his shoulders and heaved mighty sigh of relief central earth and all its inhabitants were safe safe from losing their atmosphere to free space and safe from the old gross sword petty wrath now said ridiculous sword how are we going to brace it uh brace it gross sword asked sure you ca nt just keep holding it up forever weve got ta brace it with something gross sword thought for an instant then shook his head in dismay it would take column of adamantite bigger than all the adamantite in existence to support this much weight the only force strong enough to hold up central earth and keep it held up is somebody with twentyfive star strength like me ringman brow furrowed but but you ca nt just stay here forever sure can gross sword surmised every twelve years or so can set central earth down on my shoulder blades and buy potion of longevity from the black magic market for black market magic uh make that several potions of longevity so that if the first one backfires can cancel it real quick and then can pick central earth up again and go back to work ringman shook his head and what kind of life is that gross sword sighed sacrificial one hell got us into this scrape in the first place if had nt been suckered over to the evil side of things we could have all gone out together and ridded ourselves of peter perfect once and for all have to repay this world for the damage ve done this is the only way know how no ridiculous sword replied there another way we can train huge numbers of people to have 25star strength and have them take turns holding up the plate for which they ll get paid five silver pieces an hour or some such gross sword brightened up for fleeting instant then sank back no it better this way do nt deserve ridiculous sword cut him off damn it gross sword youre worth more than this gross sword blinked his eyes realizing something but saying nothing ridiculous sword wrinkled her mouth shut and nodded lets go gross sword we re going to get you out of this predicament even if you wo nt she took ringman hand and gestured to disgusting sword jimmy and homer prometheus slid itself into ringman sheath grudgingly coming back to its first master for the third time the war was over it was time for the healing to begin epilog fordinchuarlikomfterrablaxxuuuuuchhchhchhpt did not fit ringman concept of an ideal vacation spot ridiculous sword took him to that plane with nothing since no material possessions other than those created there could make the voyage ringman and his younger daughter materialized starknaked in the middle of fuzzy cold green place it took nearly minute for the paladin vision to clear for the green to resolve itself into grass and for him to cringe as notsonaked woman rushed out to greet them he instinctively crossed his hands over his groin ringman expected this woman to shout insults at them for mucking about on her lawn with all this interplanar travel nonsense but instead she smiled and waved to them she pulled the front of her skirt away from her legs and bounded toward them unable to conceal her morethanwellfed bulk fire eater she cried out fire eater you ve come back she stopped about twenty feet away finally able to make out their features oh excuse me she apologized one hand on her heaving chest thought say are you two any relation to the fire eater ridiculous sword extended psionic probe and gleaned picture of the fire eater from the woman mind the memory was more than eleven years old but it was clearly of sick sword ridiculous sword nodded her head solemnly the fire eaters dead oh the woman felt concerned for few instants then it passed especially when she took good look at ringman her lips slowly broke into smile hey what your name ringman he replied now shivering from the morning cold he felt somewhat imposed upon as well until he looked into her bright little eyes what yours she put her hands on his shoulders my name izabella she looked down little lower mmm you have quite physique she looked still lower yes quite thanks ringman replied his teeth now chattering whoever invented the morning chill should be skewered bbbut cccould you gget me some ccclothes to wear izabella puzzled momentarily then leapt back to reality oh oh sure sorry follow me she led them both into her farm house gave them each one of her old tattered terrycloth robes and sat them down around small circular kitchen table she also poured them each hot drink as far as ringman was concerned hot dirty water never tasted so good as now we re here ridiculous sword broke in because my mother the fire eater promised to come back here one day to check up on things she never got around to it so decided to bring my father here and myself izabella bright little eyes narrowed to scrutiny as she came closer to ringman you were the fire eater wife well ringman shrugged for all intents and purposes yes she stared at him out of the corner of her eye you mean you two were nt legally married no as matter of fact the other book of infinite wisdom had nt come out by then and that was the first place which listed marriage spell izabella shrugged oh all right then she complied and sat down next to him little too close next to him by most counts but ringman smiled and put his right arm around her anyway so ridiculous sword continued how well have things been working out here in north uh north north fliedershire izabella filled in the name of the town by the way ringman how old are you thirtytwo years young he replied with chuckle and ridiculous sword here is ten and my other daughter and my son are eleven and nine respectively her name ridiculous sword he shrugged sick sword picked it out ah and um why did nt you bring your whole family here ringman well ridiculous sword told her gross sword that my brother is out holding up the entire planet of central earth and disgusting sword has already recruited over two thousand atlasstrength people to take turns taking gross sword place and is looking for more holding up the planet izabella mouthed in astonishment oh and dad did nt bring me here ridiculous sword finished brought him mmm hmm izabella nodded slowly so see that the fire eater power runs in the family and more ridiculous sword stated matteroffactly izabella raised her eyebrows then realized she had nt been paying attention to ringman for nearly thirty seconds and put her left arm around his shoulders and uh what happened that your brother has to hold up the planet ridiculous sword sighed some jerk who called himself peter perfect killed atlas so somebody had to stay and keep the world from falling yeah ringman agreed good thing the fall killed him too or you kids might have had to get your hands dirty his body got so splattered there no way anybody could resurrect him now so he ll stay in heaven completely out of harm way until some dummy decides to reincarnate him he killed atlas and he still got to go to heaven you betcha ringman said he was lawfulgood hmmm wonder how he making out in heaven right now ridiculous sword whacked herself on her 19intelligence forehead thanks for reminding me she cupped her hands in front of ringman and projected some bluewhite mental energy there peter perfect sent me telepagram from heaven just this morning here take look ringman and izabella drew closer as an image formed out of the blue void blondhaired man wearing gold ring over his head and winged white choir robe resolved himself against backdrop of clouds and others dressed like him he was holding his ears vehemently and screaming ca nt stand this anymore all ever meet are bunch of peaceminded angels strumming their stupid harps bleacch not even lousy stinking little piece of evil to stomp on this is no fun at all ringman snorted chuckle looks like he gone to hell after all ridiculous sword folded her hands and the image vanished getting back to why came here in the first place how has north fliedershire been holding out since the fire eater was last here oh wonderfully izabella said with lilt that nasty old smaugzilla made an excellent set of luggage and it was nice not having dragon burn down all your crops all the time too funny thing though always thought dragons had huge treasure hordes inside their caves when the townsfolk excavated this one all they found was an egg five feet across an egg ridiculous sword sat up dragon egg well we think so if it is we ll give the dragon baby everything we ve got to make it turn out good instead of evil like its mother make red dragon turn out good ridiculous sword voice got more urgent and this egg been there for over eleven years my god ii its incubation period almost up we have to get there and mean now izabella shook her head nervously um there are some horses in the garage if no mean right now she reached across the table and grasped ringman and izabella free hands have you been to this place where the egg is oh countless times izabella told her good want you to close your eyes and visualize this place in your mind she closed her eyes ridiculous sword picked up on her thoughts they were bit foggy really see this place in your head ridiculous sword pushed her onward visualize every detail you ever saw when you were last there every shade every sound every scent even the air temperature if you can remember it izabella did the image of the cave mouth and the wooden fence came in as sharply as the stars in space good now boink is this it izabella opened her eyes and gasped she was actually there it was lot cooler than the time she just visualized since the last time she been there was in early afternoon but this was the place teleportation ridiculous sword told her do it all the time and that she crossed the twofoothigh wooden picket and stared at the red speckled bulb in its center must be smaugzilla egg uh huh izabella nodded ringman furrowed his brow despite being an obscure ninth level bythebook paladin he did have certain powers of his own which he could exercise that funny he commented after few seconds it supposed to be red dragon egg but dont detect any evil coming from it me neither ridiculous sword concurred this is damned strange she looked bit more intently at the egg my god ii she exclaimed look at this xray picture how ringman and izabella asked simultaneously oh sorry ridiculous sword caught herself that is nt baby red dragon in there at all no ringman asked no the neck the wrong length the head resembles horse more than it does lizard and the skin has metallic sheen and there not the slightest sign of deformity its just plain straight different species of draco izabella eyes grew suddenly distant the legend huh ringman asked what legend not another one of these again ridiculous sword muttered the legend of the fire eater leftovers izabella exclaimed ah well that clarifies everything ringman muttered life in the multiverse could get so confusing at times like these he wished it was all just castles and damsels and dragons and things once again those he could understand after the fire eater triumph izabella recited eleven cycles of hyperion bronze chariot will go and then the fruits of the dragon demise will ripen and force that had been lost will be replaced in the universe the legend must have been talking about this baby dragon or it could have been talking about baked potatoes ridiculous sword sneered that the thing about these legends they re all so vague but tell you what there only one way we re going to find out stand back izabella stepped back few feet ringman grabbed her and pulled her behind rock when she says stand back he told her she means it normally baby dragon can hatch from its egg within six months ridiculous sword explained if it has the warm body of its mother to incubate it if not the embryo wo nt die but it ll mature about as slowly as glass runs downhill it can take upwards of eleven years this dragonette here is on the verge of hatching it just needs little warmth to encourage it to come out of its shell uh how much warmth izabella asked ringman suppressed snicker oh about the equivalent of ridiculous sword cast fireball spell and centered it right on the egg the wooden fence turned to ash the rocks inside of it glowed cherry red and ridiculous sword terrycloth robe disintegrated her hair was little mussed up too after all doublestrength permanent potion of fire resistance could only do so much red dragon breath ringman and izabella came out from behind the rock in time to see the egg crack the first shell fragment fell away and polished but damp footlong dragon head poked out of the hole and glanced around not seeing its mommy it shut its eyes and wailed few bucketfulls of tears ridiculous sword gabbed the head and stroked it that calmed it down bit and gave it enough incentive to bust the rest of the way out of its shell the sun chose just that moment to peer over the horizon and glinted off its dewspecked dragon skin with an silverygolden light my deity ringman whispered silver dragon ridiculous sword looked back up at him and shook her head no platinum dragon platinum ringman mouthed the first one to be born in over two thousand years the first one to be born since bahamut new lord of the dragons ringman mused he ll have lot to learn before he can become that but he has 401 years before he an ancient dragon and ready for that position anyway um you re sure it he ringman asked suspiciously sure his daughter assured him all platinum dragons ever born are male and besides checked this puzzled the paladin still further but if all platinum dragons are male that means that they ca nt reproduce that cause they re hybrid you see when gold and silver dragon mate they produce an electrum dragon if this electrum dragon then goes on and mates with speaking spell using dragon of another species any species good or evil they either produce no offspring which is usually the case or they produce one of these she indicated the platinum dragon chick in her arms that how bahamut was born in the first place so then izabella put the pieces together smaugzilla had to have mated with one of those electric dragons electrum dragons and yes these affairs are rare occurrences indeed because electrum dragons never live past the age of subadulthood but this one here and we re going to keep it that way until he able to take care of himself ringman whistled four hundred and one years heck itll take him fifty years just to grow into full adult that lot of time to devote to one creature mm hmm matter of fact he probably be best off if he were taken care of by someone from north fliedershire like you for instance izabella izabella gulped mme but could nt even raise cows right do nt know anything about raising dragons they can pretty much take care of themselves just feed him scrambled eggs and teach him how to speak and he ll be able to tell you everything he needs by the time he six months old send him off to magic college when he and he ll be casting firstlevel spells before you know it izabella shrugged sounds simple enough but she smiled at ringman could sure use nice strong man to stay and help me raise this dragon ringman pursed his lips or you and the platinum dragon could come back to central earth with me have great little keep set up in town she stroked finger along the hairy exposed portion of his chest well we ll see new bahamut ridiculous sword nodded and smiled the dragon cuddled up against her chest and purred beautiful new bahamut wonder what we should name him bahamut the second izabella offered bahamut junior ringman chuckled ridiculous sword rubbed her chin how about sick dragon no izabella and ringman shouted as one you tell em distant voice from behind intruded huh ridiculous sword turned around first unaccustomed to being without the 360degree aid of her robe of eyes naked boy was running toward them he was easy to recognize hi rid jimmy said as he arrived two seconds later he would have been out of breath except that he had an 18 constitution hi mr ringman jimmy what are you doing here ridiculous sword asked with one fist on her hip oh just trying out some psionic plane travelling shoulda guessed from the piles of junk that fell to the floor when you two left that this plane does nt allow any carryon luggage but oh well hey who the fat broad izabella ringman stared him levelly in the eye my new girlfriend jimmy stopped himself oh and who the dragon bahamut the second bahamut junior and sick dragon all came out at once jimmy thought for second how about just calling him bahamut like the old one well why not ridiculous sword acquiesced sure sounds good to me good jimmy sealed their agreement but anyway rs there was somethin that been buggin me yes when turned into that hill giant and attacked grosssword with the ballista of automatic missile fire mm hmm that shouldnt ve worked just because hill giant has 62 or more hit dice does nt mean got to have 62 or more hit dice was only fifthlevel at the time should nt have been able to affect him was wondering when you were going to figure that out ridiculous sword told him wo nt tell the dungeon master if you wo nt jimmy mopped his brow in relief agreed oh and one more thing about how helped with stopping gross sword and peter perfect and ridiculous sword held up restraining hand wait do nt tell me jimmy nodded and he ridiculous sword and ringman all joined in chanting the immortal words how many experience points do we get jeff boeing roger wilcox cbcsc063 masecscsunedu estas malpermesita entrudi sin en la evoluon
