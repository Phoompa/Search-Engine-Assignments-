the emperor new clothes once upon time there lived vain emperor whose only worry in life was to dress in elegant clothes he changed clothes almost every hour and loved to show them off to his people word of the emperor refined habits spread over his kingdom and beyond two scoundrels who had heard of the emperor vanity decided to take advantage of it they introduced themselves at the gates of the palace with scheme in mind we are two very good tailors and after many years of research we have invented an extraordinary method to weave cloth so light and fine that it looks invisible as matter of fact it is invisible to anyone who is too stupid and incompetent to appreciate its quality the chief of the guards heard the scoundrel strange story and sent for the court chamberlain the charnberlain notified the prlme minister who ran to the emperor and disclosed the incredible news the emperor curiosity got the better of him and he decided to see the two scoundrels besides being invisible your highness this cloth will be woven in colours and paterns created especially for you the emperor gave the two men bag of gold coins in exchange for their promise to begin working on the fabric immediately just tell us what you need to get started and we ll give it to you the two scoundrels asked for loom silk gold thread and then pretended to begin working the emperor thought he had spent his money quite well in addition to getting new extraordinary suit he would discover which of his subjects were ignorant and incompetent few days later he called the old and wise prime minister who was considered by everyone as man with common sense go and see how the work is proceeding the emperor told him and come back to let me know the prime minister was welcomed by the two scoundrels we re almost finished but we need lot more gold thread here excellency admire the colours feel the softness the old man bent over the loom and tried to see the fabric that was not there he felp cold sweat on his forehead ca nt see anything he thought if see nothing that means stupid or worse incompetent if the prime minister admitted that he didn see anything he would be discharged from his office what marvellous fabric he said then ll certaln tell the emperor the two scoundrels rubbed their hands gleefully they had almost made it more thread was requested to finish the work finally the emperor received the announcement that the two tailors had come to take all the measurements needed to sew his new suit come in the emperor ordered even as they bowed the two scoundrels pretended to be holding large roll of fabric here it is your highness the result of our labour the scoundrels said we have worked night and day but at last the most beautiful fabric in the world is ready for you look at the colours and feel how fine it is of course the emperor did not see any colours and could not feel any cloth between his fingers he panicked and felt like fainting but luckily the throne was right behind him and he sat down but when he realized that no one could know that he did not see the fabric he felt better nobody could find out he was stupid and incompetent and the emperor did nt know that everybody else around him thought and did the very same thing the farce continued as the two scoundrels had foreseen it once they had taken the measurements the two began cutting the air with scissors while sewing with their needles an invisible cloth your highness you ll have to take off your clothes to try on your new ones the two scoundrels draped the new clothes on him and then held up mirror the emperor was embarrassed but since none of his bystanders were he felt relieved yes this is beautiful suit and it looks very good on me the emperor said trying to look comfortable you ve done fine job your majesty the prime minister said we have request for you the people have found out about this extraordinary fabric and they are anxious to see you in your new suit the emperor was doubtful showing himself naked to the people but then he abandoned his fears after all no one would know about it except the ignorant and the incompetent all right he said will grant the people this privilege he summoned his carriage and the ceremonial parade was formed group of dignitaries walked at the very front of the procession and anxiously scrutinized the faces of the people in the street all the people had gathered in the main square pushing and shoving to get better look an applause welcomed the regal procession everyone wanted to know how stupid or incompetent his or her neighbour was but as the emperor passed strange murmur rose from the crowd everyone said loud enough for the others to hear look at the emperor new clothes they re beautiful what marvellous train and the colours the colours of that beautiful fabric have never seen anything like it in my life they all tried to conceal their disappointment at not being able to see the clothes and since nobody was willing to admit his own stupidity and incompetence they all behaved as the two scoundrels had predicted child however who had no important job and could only see things as his eyes showed them to him went up to the carriage the emperor is naked he said fool his father reprimanded running after him do nt talk nonsense he grabbed his child and took him away but the boy remark which had been heard by the bystanders was repeated over and over again until everyone cried the boy is right the emperor is naked it true the emperor realized that the people were right but could not admit to that he though it better to continue the procession under the illusion that anyone who could nt see his clothes was either stupid or incompetent and he stood stiffly on his carriage while behind him page held his imaginary mantle
