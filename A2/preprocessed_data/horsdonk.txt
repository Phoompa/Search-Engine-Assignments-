the horse and the donkey once upon time an old carter kept horse and donkey in the same stable he was equally fond of both his animals but as he used the horse to pull his trap he gave it better food and more attention than he did the donkey however the donkey knowing he was not so precious as his stablemate ate straw instead of corn and hay without complaining even when both animals carried sacks to market the donkey was the heavier load for the carter did not want to overwork his noble horse though he had no such feelings about the donkey as time went by the horse grew more handsome and robust while the donkey became thin and weak one day on their way to market the donkey was carrying his usual heavy load while the horse had only two lightweight sacks tied to the saddle ca nt go much further moaned the donkey much weaker today can hardly stand and unless can get rid of some of this weight wo nt be able to go on could nt you take some of my load when the horse heard this he looked the donkey up and down in disdain for he considered himself much superior and said our master gave you the heavy load because he knows that donkeys are beasts of burden their loads ought to be heavier than those of noble horses so the wretched donkey stumbled on but after short distance he stopped again blearyeyed his tongue hanging out please please listen if you do nt help me ll never reach market alive but without even glance the horse haughtily replied rubbish come on you ll manage this time too but this time after few tottering steps the donkey dropped dead to the ground the donkey master who had lingered to pick mushrooms ran up when he saw the animal fall poor thing he said he served me well for so many years his load must have been too heavy then he turned to the horse come here you ll have to carry your companion load too now and he hoisted the donkey sacks onto the horse back have done better to help the donkey when he was alive said the horse to himself little more weight would nt have done me any harm now frightened of collapsing myself under double load but feeling sorry too late did nothing to lighten his load
