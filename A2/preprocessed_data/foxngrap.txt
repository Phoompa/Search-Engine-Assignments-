fox and the grapes once upon time in wood there lived very crafty quickwitted fox the rabbits rats the birds and all the other creatures fled at the sight of him for they all knew how cruel and famished he was and since his prey kept fearfully out of sight the fox had no choice but to haunt the neighbourhood buildings in the hope of finding something to eat the first time he was in luck near lonely peasant cottage only low fence stood between him and the hen run and there he left death and destruction behind him what careless men leaving such tender fat hens unguarded he said to himself as he trotted away still munching few days later hungry once more he decided to visit the same hen run again he crept up to the fence thread of smoke curled from the cottage chimney but all was quiet with great bound he leapt into the hen run the cackling hens scattered and the fox was already clutching one in his jaws when stone hit him on the side wicked brute yelled man waving stick now ve got you to make matters worse up raced large dog snarling viciously the fox dropped the hen and tried to jump out of the hen run at the first try he fell back perhaps weak with fright he could almost feel the dog fangs sink into his ear but with desperate jump he got over the fence the yells and stones streamed after the bruised fox as he ran into the wood in nearby glade he glanced round to make sure that he was not being followed bad luck he said to himself all those hens his mouth was watering and he could feel gnawing hunger pains right above his head stretched vine laden with bunches of big ripe grapes well if there nothing else muttered the fox jumping up towards the grapes but the bunches were hanging just beyond his reach the fox then took running jump at them but without success and though he tried over and over again the grapes remalned beyond his grasp craw craw craw laughed crow overhead mocking the disappointed fox sour grapes exclaimed the fox loudly i11 come back when they re ripe and thrusting out his chest to give himself airs though still smarting from the blows he had received he set off towards the woods with an empty stomach
