the seven old samurai once upon time in far off japan band of fierce robbers had their hiding place on top of mountain almost always covered with grey clouds windswept and battered by storms the robbers lived in large cave where they had piled their spoils now and again they went down the mountain attacked village murdered the poor folk they chanced upon stole whatever they could lay hands on and burned it to the ground wherever the robbers passed there was nothing but smoking ruins weeping men and women misery mournlng and desolation the emperor worried at this had sent his soldiers to attack the mountain but the robbers had always managed to drive them off the emperor sent for one of the last remaining samurai old raiko and said to him raiko you ve served me for many years do my bidding for one last time go to the mountain at the head of an army and wipe out these bloodthirsty bandits raiko sighed your majesty if were young again do it alone today too old far too old to do that or to command an army must then said the emperor submit to the force of these marauding robbers the old samurai replied no ll go up there with six samurai like myself but if they re all as old as you how can they help you have faith in us said raiko few days later the seven samurai set off on their journey not with horses swords shields and armour which they could no longer have worn anyway but dressed as humble pilgrims from the summit the bandits watched them come and their leader said who cares about seven beggars let them climb up the seven reached the cave and raiko humbly said let us come in it cold outside there wind blowing and we as you can see are old men we ll be no trouble to you the leader of the gang scornfully replied come in old men and stay in corner and so the seven pilgrims huddled in corner while the bandits ate their meal of food stolen from the villages nearby now and again they threw scraps of food and leftovers to the old men saying eat this and it is much too good for you few hours later raiko rose to his feet saying the wind has dropped we can go on our way in thanks for your hospitality we would like to offer you this liqueur it is sake rice wine drink our health with it the robbers needed no second telling in the blink of an eye they had emptied the goatskin bottle raika held out to them and in the blink of an eye they all lay dead for the sake contained very potent poison and so the seven samurai too old to wield sword served the emperor for the last time
