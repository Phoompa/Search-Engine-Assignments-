the hare and the porcupine once upon time an old porcupine lived in large wood with his twin sons apples were their favourite dish but the youngsters sometimes raided neighbouring vegetable plot for the turnips dad loved to munch one day one of the young porcupines set off as usual to fetch the turnips like all porcupines he was slow walker and he had just reached large cabbage when from behind the leaves out popped hare so you have arrived at last said the hare ve been watching you for half an hour do you always dawdle hope you re quicker at eating or it will take you year to finish the turnips instead of going into huff at being teased the porcupine decided to get his own back by being very crafty slow on his feet but quick thinker he rapidly hit on plan so the hare sneered at the slow porcupine did he well the hare own turn of speed would be his downfall can run faster than you if try said the porcuplne ha ha the hare shrieked with laughter raising large paw you ca nt compete with this my grandad was the speediest hare of his day he even won gold penny he used to be my coach and you tell me you can run faster than me well bet my grandad gold penny that can win without even trying the porcupine paid little heed to the hare boastful words and quietly acccepted the challenge ll meet you tomorrow down at the ploughed field we ll race in parallel furrows and see wins the hare went away laughing better stay here all night you ll never get home and back in time for the race he told the porcupine the porcupine however had bright idea when he arrived home he told his twin brother what had happened just before dawn next day he gave his instructions and off they set for the field hare appeared rudely remarking ll take off my jacket so can run faster ready steady go and in flash the hare streaked to the other end of the field there waiting for him was porcupine which tesingly said rather late are nt you ve been here for ages gasping and so breathless his throat was dry the hare whispered let try again all right agreed the porcupine we ll run the race again never in all his life had the hare run so fast not even with the hounds snapping at his heels but every time he reached the other end of the ploughed field what did he flnd but the porcupine who laughingly exclaimed what late again keep on getting here first racing up and down the field the hare sped trying to beat the porcupine his legs grew terribly tired and he began to sag and every time he came to the end of the field there stood porcupine calling himself the winner perhaps ought to mention friend hare that my grandad was the fastest porcupine of his day he did nt win gold penny but he won apples and after the race he ate them but do nt want apples rather have the nice gold penny you promised me said one of the porcupine twins the hare slid to the ground dead tired his head was spinning and his legs felt like rubber this race is the end of me shall die here in this field where really believed was sprinter the shame of it what disgrace the hare staggered home hot and sticky to fetch the gold penny that he had never for moment ever imagined he would lose his eyes brimming with tears he handed it over to the porcupines thank goodness my grandad is nt alive to see this he said whatever would he say after all his coaching here am beaten by porcupine that evening party was held at the porcupines house the twins danced triumphantly in turn waving aloft the gold penny father porcupine brought out his old accordion for the special occasion and the fun went on all night as luck would have it the hare never did find out the secret of how the race had been rigged which was just as well
