pyramid scheme written by douglas warren copyright 1993 james washed his hands in the stained sink checking them final time he shook them dry spattering droplets on the cloudy mirror he skeptically surveyed his reflection his hair was black and shiny like cheap vinyl gathered by leather band into braid that flowed over his shoulder in honor of his totem the braid had been dyed with horizontal stripes to resemble raccoon tail slowly turning his head james eyed his slightly hooked nose his nose and dark completion marked him as having indian blood however his receding hairline bespoke anglo genes as well he rubbed his eyes and groaned deeply without looking james reached up and yanked the chain hanging from the bare light bulb he turned away from the sink and removed his buckskin coat from hook nailed to the wall dust fell from the aged coat as he lifted it the rough leather seemed to pick up dust like magnet he shook it roughly scattering more crap into the air he slipped on the coat buttoning the polished bone buttons the coat was relic from dead age its intricate beadwork was dulled and worn from years of weather and wear the coat had been gift to his grandfather from his ute wife she had toiled for years on reservation before the softspoken sociologist had swept her away with gifts and promises working secretly for months james grandmother had made the coat from native materials and had presented it to her husband on their tenth anniversary peter broussard had worn the coat as badge of his love for her when peter son paul had turned sixteen he was given the coat paul in turn had passed it to james when he had turned sixteen that was nineteen years ago and the world had changed since then james walked into the main room of his flat the dim light threw shadows into the corners of the small room dust covered trideo screen sat on shelf cluttered with burnedout fetishes mixed in with the useless tokens were several empty cred sticks with the rent due soon james had to lay his hands on some quick nuyen otherwise he would be out on the streets just another squatter james dreaded that seattle was nt very kind to its poor he made his way to squat synthwood dresser and slid open the top drawer two pistols were tucked under pile of rumpled underwear james picked up one and weighed it in his hand the ruger had never felt quite right to him sighing he stuffed the gun into the waist band of his baggy trousers james gently picked up the other pistol it was nestled in holster with magical symbols carved into the soft leather he slid the smooth grip into his palm and tightened his fist smile passed across his face the predator had always seemed like natural extension of his arm after checking the clip james thumbed on the safety and deposited the weapon back into its holster he snapped the holster on its mounting clips inside his weather beaten coat james smoothed out the line of his jacket and headed for the door as he keyed the lock with his thumb he stopped short reaching up he removed his war club from its roost above the door he strode out into the grimy hallway and hung the club on his belt as the door closed with an audible thud the hall reeked of mildew and sweat the deep shadows hid ragged transients sleeping in smelly heaps james shook his head as he stepped over particularly dirty hobo whose bulk had spilled into the center of the corridor the dregs piled up in the halls on the coldest day no matter what the landlord did james face hardened as he moved closer to the tenement front door as he pushed the door open his face darkened with look of intensity he was no longer james broussard the people in the shadows knew him as bishop fuzz magic muscle for hire he pulled the supple coat closer to his thick frame and scrambled down the cold stone steps the barrens were just starting to come to life in the early dusk fuzz passed group of people wearing cheap synthleather outfits they gave him wide berth as he mumbled under his breath watching him as he passed the punks whispered carefully to keep fuzz from hearing there that crazy shaman again one remarked seen him roast hole gogo gang without batting an eye chummer another added no drek joyboy them magic types play with ghosts and stuff makes me damn nervous it ai nt natural bishop fuzz did nt even seem to notice the surrounding slum he just walked straight to the purple haze bar just like he had hundred times before huge neon light hummed over the bar bronze door as fuzz stepped inside he was embraced by wafting cloud of purple smoke the scent of nicsticks almost choked him before he took three steps inside he nodded to the bartender and headed toward table that the orc motioned to fuzz immediately recognized three of the men sitting at the table one was big orc dressed like seoul man his well tailored suit could nt hide the sinewy muscles of the metahuman the larger occupant fuzz also recognized he was troll that dwarfed even the stout orc the troll wore an expensive leather jacket over camouflaged jumpsuit he sat facing the door watching fuzz approach the table the third was rumpled looking human named deveaux the three were talking quietly with slick looking runner and corp wage slave that was obviously out of his element fuzz greeted his associates with sly smile hoi jinga what chased you out from under your rock the orc frowned and crossed his arms the troll snickered and shifted in his chair fuzz reached out and grasped the trolls shoulder squeezing gently still fooling everybody with the jarhead routine eh sika fuzz laughed the troll shot him toothy grin and slapped fuzz on the arm so you finally decided that we were better company than the rats in your apartment the troll inquired fuzz shook his head nope but got ta make living what biz today the troll turned in his chair and introduced the other people at the table this is mister kramer he is in the employ of an unnamed corp and he would like to hire us for an unauthorized data retrieval mission next sika motioned to the pudgy human wearing threadbare suit sitting next to the timid wage slave to mr kramer left is as you know rick deveaux he will be gathering any information we require prior to the actual mission to mr kramer right is allister watkins he will be assisting you with the mission magical chores watkins was slight man with sandy hair cut close to his scalp his eyes gleamed even in the shadows of the bar naturally will be handling the net during our tenure sika continued and jinga will act as protection if any resistance arises sika introduced bishop fuzz to the mage and the corp and invited the shaman to have seat this my new friends is bishop fuzz he is ute shaman of great renown watkins snorted contemptuously and sneered at fuzz is it necessary to include this mystic his tricks are no match for my real magic jinga laughed loudly and leaned over the table real magic you do nt have to worry about the bishop he has got plenty of juice where it counts the orc tone suddenly hardened you should have more respect watkins had no way of knowing that jinga mother had been shaman her promising career as runner had been cut short by corporate wage mage jinga had enjoyed killing that particular mage during run seven years ago ever since his mother death jinga had distrusted mages fuzz spoke up loudly to diffuse the confrontation between the brawny orc and the mage pardon me folks but not going to do anything until we discuss some numbers the mage eyed the orc with contempt as mr kramer wrote on crumpled napkin the napkin was passed around the table each runner read the number and nodded when fuzz turn came he glanced at their figure scrawled on the soiled napkin barely containing gasp the take equaled one hundred thousand nuyen each with that much liquid cash fuzz could sit tight for couple months and study spells he had been playing with the idea for years but had never been able to score that many nuyen at one time after visions of vacation rushed through his mind doubt squirmed into his head could this wage slave come up with that kind of cash or was he bluffing if he was bluffing the runners would come down hard on him risk without reward was serious breach in etiquette the napkin was passed back to kramer and he stuffed it into his coat pocket for the first time he spoke for several months have been working on matrix program that will believe revolutionize decking it surrounds the decker persona with halo of random data if an ic program initiates action against the persona the random data will absorb the force thereby protecting the decker the data halo also serves to obscure the decker identity my employers originally asked me to study ways to increase the security of our grid created the halo program to test our ic system the halo was almost unstoppable if this program was used by particularly talented decker the result could prove disastrous for the target an intense light burned in the programmer eyes as he described the halo kramer stopped abruptly and collected his thoughts well more to the point recently believe that my employers have been using the halo program to raid systems belonging to other corporations as of yet have not received any compensation for the use of my program this is why have contacted you sika the troll stared openmouthed at kramer do you realize how valuable such program is yes have some idea although decking is nt my specialty well let me tell you with program like the one you have described no currently running system is secure could transfer nuyen from any account to any other account without any trouble at all its like owning key that can open any lock in the world the rest of the runners were licking their chops in anticipation it looked like the payoff was legit maybe even too small for the first time watkins seemed interested the runners talked casually in an abandoned warehouse they waited anxiously wondering when their contact would arrive as if on cue rick deveaux shuffled in and stacked up several empty crates he produced battered briefcase and heaved in onto the makeshift table making it wobble drunkenly there ya go this is all the info could get on the security of the aztechnology compound there are several possible routes in they re marked in red the heavy set man shifted uncomfortably then continued still ca nt figure why mr could nt dig up any hardcopies of the compound his sources got ta be more up to date rick opened the case stacks of computer paper spilled out covering the table jinga picked up colorful map from among the printouts what the drek is this jinga growled it looks like travel brochure rick snatched the map from the fuming orc hand them aztec are proud of their little home was able to lay my grubby little paws on this employee orientation packet they were even nice enough to label almost everything all of the runners laughed at the portly cajun wisecrack friends friends we must now plan our outing sika gathered the runners together and began to thumb through the printouts my goodness these men at the compound are paranoid every room within the perimeter has full sensor array if gain access to the net that could come in handy after waiting few minutes to give the other runners chance to look over the info deveaux spoke far as can figure the easiest way in is through this service entrance on the north end the traffic on mercer street thins out enough at night that we wo nt get no notice from there we just got ta cross the park around the building barghest is what we need to watch out for deveaux brushed hair out of his face and cleared his throat from there my maps ai nt much good public areas are marked but offices ai nt that where you take over sika the troll nodded agreement and continued the briefing once you fellows have breached the outer walls will lead you to kramer lab have way of shutting down the perimeter security once inside will blink the lights along the easiest routes that should be easy enough to follow however the labs computers are inaccessible from the outside which is why you have to make it to the lab during nonworking hours the lab terminals and storage equipment are physically disconnected from the net to avoid intrusion wo nt be able to access any of the lab systems any security in place will have to be bypassed manually you are responsible for that phase mr deveaux once you have downloaded the program speed is of the essence mr kramer should be waiting near the service exit for an extraction hopefully the operation will look like kidnapping thus adding to the confu pardon me watkins interrupted all of this is very entertaining but you have neglected to mention one thing why have my magical services been retained if the operation is as simple as you let on why not hire couple more brainless razorboys jinga growled and moved toward the small mage bishop fuzz laid restraining hand on the orc shoulder was just about to come to that it has been rumored that the aztechnology has large number of mages on staff to deal with security threats in order to counterbalance that possible complication we have retained you in addition to the bishop your combined skills should be sufficient to deal with any eventuality have heard lot of things about the aztecs manna troops and they do nt sound to friendly fuzz added in fact chummer of mine says they stress body count over information so take them down hard if possible nothing flashy fuzz looked straight at jinga to make his point do nt worry bishop if you want them cold your man or your orc to be exact none of the runners appreciated the samurai levity if one person screwed up during run it could cost the entire team their lives with that much at stake humor was scarce commodity caution was nt bishop fuzz had trusted his life to all of the runners at one time or another except for watkins the sly little mage was still an unknown fuzz had known jinga for little over three years meeting during run the orc was basically good guy although little rough however jinga was obsessed with his image constantly posturing and competing he always seemed to be involved in fights over some imagined insult usually the task of mediation fell to fuzz the oldest member of the group jinga hypersensitivity did nt spring from his status as metahuman quite to the contrary he was fiercely proud of his savage heritage this resulted form being born an orc he had never known anything else and relished the physical prowess his parentage had bestowed on him the team other metahuman sika was also an old friend of fuzz he was small by troll standards but dwarfed all but the largest humans refugee of the hellish yomi island sika had turned to technomancy to make up for his small stature the other trolls welcomed sharp mind into their usually dullminded circle finally able to make bigger scores running the shadows after accumulating enough nuyen sika decided to part company with his friends on yomi seeking better living in seattle coming from an area dominated by metahumans he was unprepared for the naked racism that flourished in his new home for many months sika was unable to find work as decker simply because of his heritage who ever heard of troll decker anyway six years ago he finally got his chance he was approached by shabby looking street shaman who was strapped for cash jumping at any opportunity sika agreed to work for bishop fuzz the troll share of the take had certainly grown since then so had his reputation on the streets as kind of an inside joke the decker dressed like samurai most people tended to underestimate his worth as matrix cowboy fortunately sika was one of the best adding to the team effectiveness originally from the bayous of louisiana rick deveaux had been valuable member of the group for the last few years his backwoods charm carried over well in the tougher areas of seattle many people mistook his rural mannerisms for lack of intelligence big mistake when dealing with deveaux people tended to say to much around rick because they underestimated him but information was his business fuzz trusted deveaux to provide first rate data never putting profit over integrity everything about him seemed out of place in the sprawl from his cajun accent to his old fashioned clothes maybe that was the reason bishop liked the detective so much deveaux didnt constantly remind him of what his city had become that will be quite enough sika snapped at jinga breaking fuzz train of thought we must plan our actions carefully or there may be serious problem whatever jinga snorted deveaux stepped up and continued to lay down his plan after sika gets us to the lab will scramble the electronic lock it should nt take more than few seconds to bust the puppy once inside jinga will have to jack in to download the program since he is the only one of us with plug we are very vulnerable without his firepower while he is on line so we got to keep sharp eye hopefully the techs that run the lab did nt put to much ic on their internal system but you got to be careful jinga do nt think we got to worry to much about magic wards in the lab techs dont like manna flingers to much anyway once we got the program he head out hard and fast no stopping or splitting up we only got one ride out and if you ai nt there we leave without you there will be maxitaxi waiting for us just outside the gate it should be big enough to hold all of us no problem deveaux paused for any questions then continued that it boys all we need now is little luck hit and run watkins questioned sardonically you cant come up with anything better than that bishop had to put hand on jinga shoulder to calm him if you do nt like it then do nt go the orc growled maybe that is very good idea sika stepped in between the two runners mr watkins we need your magic skills to ensure the success of the mission assure you that mr deveaux has analyzed all the available information and has submitted worthy plan the payment should cover any risks involved in the mission so please reconsider watkins relaxed at the trolls words and nodded yes you re right the money is to good too turn my back on as the runners settled down and thought over the plan deveaux packed up his case and prepared to leave the job goes down five hours from now sika addressed the runners suggest you all go home and blow off little steam need you in top form or we could all get burned we are going to assemble the team here at six pm do nt be late the troll looked straight at jinga the orc wore pained expression and agreed the runners filed out of the building and went their separate ways fuzz sat on stool at the counter of sidewalk food stand hoi give me soy dog no onions he flipped the cashier cred stick that it the cashier asked as he handed back fuzzs nowempty cred stick and his food fuzz nodded and unwrapped the dog he did nt especially like soy dogs but they were about all he could afford he gulped down the soymeat and stale bun relishing what little taste they had hunger often acted as the best appetizer the street shaman wadded up the dog wrapper and tossed it into trash can it was about time to meet for the mission fuzz had sacked out for couple of hours to make sure he would have plenty of energy this mission was too important to screw up because of lack of sleep if everything went as planned fuzz could stay up for the next year without worrying about work he got up and started back toward the warehouse he checked all of his equipment on the way there evidently the rest of the runners were already there beat up maxitaxi idled at the entrance waiting to take the runners to the aztechnology compound fuzz opened the door and entered the warehouse sika sat at makeshift table constructed from door and two sawhorses he was jacked into portable terminal his hands playing over the keyboard at breakneck pace rick approached fuzz he just checking everything out just in case kramer got cold feet just then sika finished his survey and disconnected the data plug from his jack there does nt seem to be any unscheduled activity in the aztec net so it looks safe for now the runners gathered around and listened this is it folks just play it cool and safe and there should not be any complications after all we are professionals sika looked straight at jinga and then watkins yeah whatever jinga responded angrily got the picture all business watkins lounged on chair in the corner look of disgust on his face can we please get on with this he said sardonically the sooner we finish this the sooner will be able to forget this cretin jinga bristled at the mage words but managed to hold his anger hundred thousand nuyen was enough to salve even the orcs savage temper what wrong tusker have you devolved past the ability to speak unexpectedly jinga just smiled do nt worry can speak when it suits me the other runners stared at the orc in disbelief never had they seen him control his temper so well usually jinga pummeled first and talked later he definitely was up to something fuzz only hoped it would nt interfere with the mission any distraction could prove fatal and that included hidden agendas sika broke the uneasy silence have found way into the aztec system if you all leave in about ten minutes will be jacked in again and ready to go by the time you arrive at the compound rick will fill in the final details in the meantime okay folks this is it after we drop off at the compound we hit the wall on the north side we may have to tank couple of guards then bang we in just run through the park and we slip in this side door only one guard to ace there remember we got ta watch for those hounds while we in the park if they corner us we shoot em otherwise no guns or magic that kinda noise attracts to much notice after that it all down hill till we hit the lab got some ideas how to bust the locks but you got ta cover me so can think getting in is easy getting out ai nt once we got the program we scat quick they gon na expect us to go out the way we came in but we ai nt we are gon na be packin aztec security uniforms for the run out we ai nt gon na wear them in though if we do they will be expecting it so we wait till we go to put em on from there we go straight out the front gate on the west side with maxitaxi waiting wave byebye to the aztecs and wave hello to 100 grand each so what you think boys fuzz and jinga both nodded but watkins just shrugged by this time sika was back into the system and ready to go fuzz said good luck to the decker as he left but the troll did nt seem to hear him his consciousness was awash in the sparkling reality of the matrix sika persona icon resembled demon small and dark with twisted limbs its size belied the strength in the misshapen arms some deckers tended to underestimate sika ability because of his choice of matrix icons the way the troll thought the flashier decker appearance in the matrix the bigger his or her ego sika chose the demon for several reasons first of all it was cheap when he started out sika was nt able to afford one of the stylish varieties so he bought simple icon program on his first mission the troll decker encountered many of the usual ic defenses one could expect in security system however sika also encountered something different after breaching his objective an active alert had gone out the system was swarming with active ic as well as company deckers sika panicked and accessed an out of the way storage node in order to hide until the heat cooled off inside the node he found several data packs that were unprotected and unlabeled he figured they were junk data left there by some lazy decker he picked them up in order to disguise himself if the ics found him they might overlook his icon and assume he was just another piece of innocuous data eventually the system went off of active alert sika carefully made his way out of the net with the information he was paid to steal plus the two unlabeled data packs an experienced matrix cowboy would have discarded the two surplus scraps of info but sika did nt flushed with his very first success he collected his payoff and found the first pay terminal he could the troll attacked the data packs with ferocity tearing into them and peeling back the layers of useless numbers the inexperienced young troll heart fell the first data pack didnt contain anything of value unless you considered week old stock info hot collectible sika nearly threw away the second batch without combing through it fortunately trolls do nt give up easily he began to strip away layer after layer of worthless data suddenly sika stumbled onto some intact code he carefully erased all the surrounding data until the hidden program began to take shape after an hour of feverish labor sika cleared away the remaining trash and sat back to view his discovery he started more detailed investigation by attempting to access the program directly there were blocks in place to prevent tampering of that sort so the attempt failed still not discouraged the troll tried more unconventional approach he attacked the code itself in order to determine if it was equipped with defenses the program immediately sprang to life it assumed the from of an imp quietly taking in its surroundings the creature scanned the confines of the terminal node until its gaze fell upon sika icon it approached the decker and sized him up who are you and what is your business here it asked sika froze this program could only be one thing black ice the imp face hardened when sika did nt reply ask again what is your business here the young decker did nt know what to do black ice was designed to attack and disable even the most experienced matrix runner if sika did nt get away quickly he would most likely die in the physical world sika hand grabbed the data plug and began to pull jacking out cold was risky but not as dangerous as facing the black ice his arm froze before he could jerk the plug from his temple fire flew from the imp hand swirling around sika icon pinning his arms to his sides sika was paralyzed caught in an electronic feedback loop the harder he tried to free himself the weaker he became the imp grin widened full of evil and glee the ic enjoyed every second of sika pain now that have you will you answer me why are you here my name is sika just dug you out of bunch of garbage data sika struggled to answer the smirking ic look of confusion filled the imp eyes sense you tell the truth but how did get here found you buried in trashed data pack just wanted to see what was inside do not understand this should nt be here yet am my parameters do not include leaving my system must think the imp froze stiff while sorting out the situation the ic did nt have commands pertaining to the net outside of its own system and without direct link to its base system the ic was confused am unable to access my cpu for further commands my programming directs me to attack only those intruding on my designated node we are not currently in that node therefore have made an error the imp lowered his hand the fire surrounding sika immediately disappeared freeing him the imp continued to speak there has been catastrophic system error am unable to reestablish contact from this location will now default to secondary command protocol system integrity protection must eliminate my internal data stores in order to safeguard against its use in future intrusion attempts terminate now the image of the imp wavered blurring around the edges the icon began to crumble disintegrating from the inside sika watched the imp dissolve into pile on electronic chaff yet something glinted from within the pile of ashes sika retrieved the object and brushed away the charred remains of the imp sika held in his hands several lines of code he gently spread them out in front of his icon surveying them they seemed to be part of the ic imaging program it was high resolution program possibly from the fuchi 10000 series high resolution imaging was expensive and hard to come by it required hours of program sculpting by talented programmer to achieve truly realistic image sika had something worth several thousand nuyen right in front of him on whim the decker accessed his own persona program he carefully removed the code that gave his icon its nondescript appearance his persona image wavered losing its humanoid shape in its place sika inserted the imp imaging program his icon began to take on new shape the shape of the imp however some of the program must have been missing sika icon shrunk its limbs contorting his icon resembled the imp to some degree but the program was forced to compensate for the missing information the deformed demon image was the end result the icon retained enough of the black ice image to make most deckers think twice about confronting him this combined with sika skills in the matrix made for great reputation among the distrustful world of the shadowrunners sika did nt even hear the other runners leave the warehouse all of his senses were slaved to the cyberdeck sitting across his lap his large fingers flew across the keyboard with practiced ease he was on his way through the matrix to the aztechnology private net in the matrix the aztec system resembled precolombian pyramid with neon lines of light radiating out into the net connecting it with the outside world millions of nuyen traveled electronically in and out of the pyramid using the password bought from one of aztechnology former programmers sika bluffed his way past the systems outer security once inside the net all of the resemblance to an ancient aztec pyramid disappeared the interior resembled highways of light moving from node to node carrying millions of bytes of information each second information was the currency of the net the password sika had used was high enough to grant him access to most of the system nodes but it was too old to grant him access to the juicer bits of aztec data but he was not after data on this run the decker job was to be the other runners guardian angel while they made their way to the protected lab deep within the building he began his preparation by locating the complex operations node before entering the node sika triggered his cyberdeck backup imaging software the demon features melted into nondescript humanoid shape one that would be ignored by most corp deckers carefully he entered the node several icons flitted around the interior adjusting various systems to keep the complex running smoothly they did nt seem to notice sika as he entered the troll watched the other icons waiting for them to react to his presence after several moments one of the icons approached the decker and queried his presence the corp decker could tell from sika password that the troll had higher access then the lowly wage slave sika quickly produced file of data and ordered the decker to update the perimeter sensor array program with the new directives he took it from sika icon and made his way to the perimeter controls when he entered the new information the system fought back the file that sika had given the corp decker was designed to cause feedback loop that would indefinitely paralyze the icon and the security system until they were released by someone with the appropriate code words the two other deckers jumped at their coworker dilemma before they could react to the loop sika released an entanglement program ball of blinding light shot from sika hand expanding into shimmering net of energy covered the deckers icons and closed around them as long as the net could draw energy from the icons it would continue to hold the deckers immobile unable to activate the system security alert the troll did not waste any time gloating over his success he shut off outside access to the node and began his work first he reactivated his cyberdeck primary imaging software the trapped deckers eyes widened as the innocuous looking intruder transformed into grinning demon sika laughed to himself would those deckers be more horrified by his real appearance or the icon he choose the troll walked over to the controls for the gate security and pressed his hand against the video interface immediately his vision was replaced by the image from the gate visual monitors he watched people come and go until the runners showed up the gate was not manned by guard anyone wanting to enter or leave was required to have their palm and retina scanned for id purposes the security computer would then compare the scans to the access records if there was match the gate would open automatically if not regular guard was summoned and they could manually open the gate if everything checked out the demon icon plunged its hand into the stream of data coming from monitoring equipment he inserted rider program into the stream and let it carry the program to the complex security processor the only purpose the program served was to confuse the processor with echoed information sika feedback loop effectively disabled the systems ability to restrict access to the complex anyone no matter who could get in through the gate the feedback loop caused the computer to erroneously match any scan to that of an authorized employee record the runners passed through the gates unmolested like any other employee coming back from day of slumming in seattle sika could nt help but laugh at the ease of the breach it had all been made possible by one disgruntled programmer with the foresight to implant secret password in the system it was not good idea to piss off top notch decker who had unlimited access to your network they had tendency to leave behind nasty surprises once the runners had made it through the outer walls sika sprang into action the lights on an out of the way path flickered for the barest of moments but it was enough to signal the runners of the right course as the trotted along the wooded path toward side entrance the baying of barghest could be heard in the distance just to be on the safe side sika switched his monitors to the kennels located on the south side of the pyramid the hounds were pacing but still in their cages the handlers did not appear to be aware of the breach in security so far the plan was working perfectly sika switched his monitor back to the outside camera and picked up the path of the runners once again they were making good progress along the winding path they reached the service entrance in the concrete wall and waited for the decker to let them in sika triggered the door lock allowing them to enter the aztechnology headquarters jinga was the first in his hand was inside his coat resting on the stock of his smartgun ready to dispatch the guard next came deveaux he was breathing heavily from carrying heavy bag filled with equipment needed for getting past the lab lock they were followed by watkins and fuzz the shaman closed the door behind the group and looked over the group trying to determine if they were ready to continue strangely there was no sign of the guard it could be lucky break or sign of trouble jinga nodded to the camera mounted on the ceiling knowing that the troll would see and understand the lights flickered signaling sika response the inner door slid open the hall beyond was empty of any workers deveaux had wisely chosen seldom used service corridor that went almost all of the way to the lab jinga led the group out of the room and into the hallway he scanned it and waited for directions from the watching decker the lights flashed down the hall to the right the group jogged down the corridor until the lights stopped blinking they came to stop directly in front of closed elevator door after several seconds there was beep and the door opened to revel large cargo lift the runners filed in and began to check their weapons if the job was going to get hot now was the most likely time they were about to enter section of the pyramid that was patrolled by armed security in addition to the normal automated security they were about to enter the aztechnology computer research center after descending for what seemed like an eternity the elevator came to stop but the doors did not open after several seconds jinga began to suspect something was not right the runners shifted uneasily and looked up at the video pickup mounted on the ceiling of the lift without warning the doors slid open the click of boot heels was easily audible coming from the otherwise quiet corridor the footsteps slowed and then stopped when the door finished opening all the runners held their breath the sound began again only this time they were coming closer jinga produced wicked looking knife from his boot and prepared to spring if needed fuzz and watkins readied their spells as well if the guard was able to raise the alarm the mission would be blown suddenly the lights in the corridor went out it was pitch black in the elevator and the hall none of the runners except for jinga could see thing sika had counted on that jinga slipped out of the elevator silently and spotted the guard with his thermographic vision orcs and trolls had the ability to see the heat person body emitted even in complete darkness jinga could see the reddish outline of medium sized human the guard was fumbling around trying to find the flashlight hanging from his belt before he could retrieve it jinga leaped at him knocking the man onto his back air rushed out of the guard lungs as the heavy orc landed on top of him the samurai clapped his hand over the guard mouth while his other hand snapped down on his throat the steel pommel of the knife impacted with the man adam apple with crunch the guard squirmed as his crushed windpipe swelled and cut off his breathing jinga laid on top of the guard until he stopped thrashing when he was sure the guard was dead jinga dragged him back to the elevator the other runners waited in silence for jinga to return after the sounds of short scuffle they clearly heard jinga coming back bishop was shocked to find the dead guard laying at his feet when the lights came back up he looked at jinga but the orc face was completely unreadable look of total concentration burned right through fuzz the orc had not meant the dead body as joke he had simply dumped it in the elevator before it was spotted by another guard jinga motioned for the rest of the group to follow him his gun was now out of his jacket ready to dispatch anyone unlucky enough to discover the party they followed trail of flickering light through maze of sterile corridors until they came to one fixture that was completely out it was directly in front of thick door recessed into the wall forming sort of alcove this has got to be it jinga said the orc took up guard position further down the hall and deveaux began ministering to the lock the detective pulled out several electronic devices from his large satchel and began hooking them up to the lock keypad now comes the hard part can tell this puppy is gon na be bitch with that he activated the devices after seemingly endless time the detective started removing the devices from the door step one down now know what we are dealing with was right this is gon na be tough you mean in all that time all you discovered was what kind of lock it is watkins was stunned sure nuff knowing what you re up against is half the trouble this ai nt like throwing dice boy one wrong key punch and the whole place knows we are here slow and steady that the way to handle this the detective words soothed the mage somewhat but he was beginning to get tense the detective threw the gadgets he had been using back into his satchel and retrieved small laptop terminal after comparing several output cables he deftly attached one to the door id processor he furiously typed in characters several times he cursed in pijin french and shook his head fuzz knew that deveaux was doing his best but he wished he would hurry up every second they were in the hall increased the possibility that they would be discovered the entire party tensed as the sound of footsteps resounded in the distance jinga checked the safety on his rifle and waited for the footsteps to get closer watkins began fishing around in bag hanging from his belt his hand came out holding sprig of some plant preparing for spell fuzz could feel the manna swelling within him until he felt as if he would burst with quiet whoop deveaux stepped away from the door it swung open to reveal nondescript computer room three terminals attached to network sat on desk in the center of an otherwise featureless room no decorations adorned the walls or desk only the computers and the supporting hardware across the room was another door marked as restroom fuzz hoped that this was the right place he had expected something else he did not know what he had expected but not this all of the runners piled into the room and they closed the door behind them and waited they were not out of danger yet if the guard had heard them or had discovered the body the entire aztechnology security force could be on its way to the lab ssss fuzz hissed through his teeth all of the shadowrunners looked at him in surprise am going to try spell deveaux just nodded all of the others seemed to go along fuzz closed his eyes and tried to find his center his consciousness slowly expanded first beyond his body then beyond the room his spirit floated through the door and checked the hall clearly seeing the guard the watchman did not seem overly concerned or on edge reassured fuzz returned to his body as his senses returned to normal he felt drained as if he had just run long distance watkins eyed the shaman with look of distaste while fuzz had been checking the corridor his body had undergone change his face had elongated giving him bestial appearance and dark circles formed around his eyes watkins considered such things side show tricks unnecessary for the performance of real magic hermetic magic jinga grinned when he saw the mages expression anything that the small mage disliked made it to the top of the orc list jinga just did not trust mages sitting in their dark libraries studying arcane tomes shaman magic had always seemed more natural to the orc and it did not help that jingas mother had been killed by mage fuzz shook off the sudden fatigue and reported his findings to the group it does nt look like he heard us so let get busy the sooner we get out of here the better will feel do nt want to run into any of those leopard troops jinga slung is hk and circled the desk flicking on each terminal as he passed as each came on line he typed in few commands until he found the file server he sat down in front of the computer and took deep breath he looked at the other runners and gave half hearted chuckle decking is nt my specialty hope they do nt have any ic on this server fuzz and deveaux returned the orc grin but watkins only rolled his eyes the orc removed short cable from his breast pocket and connected it to the terminal through the keyboard with one final look of uncertainty he slipped the plug in the jack located behind his pointed ear jinga immediately fell into trance and began typing clumsily on the keyboard it had been made for human hands and the orc thick fingers struggled to depress one key at time after several unsuccessful attempts the orc let out grunt of triumph in jinga said now all that have to do is find the damn program anybody got any ideas what they call it everything in here looks like garbage and do nt have enough room in my skull to download all of it the detective pulled small module out of his pack and inserted it into the deck external port the orc smiled when he realized what the detective had brought along one common type of corporate software security was process known as program crunching at the end of each day the software engineers run program that compressed existing programs into smaller space by defining character codes for common commands or strings of code after the compression was completed the program code was rendered unreadable without the translation key normally the key was kept in separate secure location to prevent intruders from translating stolen data anticipating such precaution deveaux had brought along external memory cache jinga shunted the data into the cache hoping that the program they wanted was within the tangled data pouring from the lab banks the runners could uncrunch the data at their leisure without aztec troops breathing down their neck the transfer from the terminal into the cache completed jinga inserted virus into the lab system to cover their tracks it would be impossible for the aztecs to tell if the valuable program had been part of the purged data or if it had been stolen the orc jacked out pulling the cache from the deck port and tossing it to deveaux we got it now let go with that the detective pocketed the cache in his hip pocket pleased at its reassuring weight each of the shadowrunners stripped off their packs and removed aztec security uniforms they pulled on the baggy jumpsuits over their clothes they would nt stand up to close inspection but the runners did not plan on sticking around long enough for anyone to realize that the group was bogus hopefully the confusion caused by the intrusion would cover their exit the scarlet jumpsuits were definite contrast to the runners normally muted clothes it was nt healthy to attract attention in their line of work deveaux suit had two small clusters of polished amber on each shoulder the rank on captain in the aztec forces if they ran into any trouble with the normal security deveaux rank might be enough to get them through without fight after adjusting the suits and checking to be sure they looked as little like runners as possible the group moved toward the door of the lab jinga peaked out ready to fire at any guards that showed up he slipped out into the hall and covered the corridor with his hk at signal from the orc the rest of the runners filed out of the lab deveaux turned and reset the lock if security alert was called automatic systems would poll all of the locks in the building checking to see if any were opened at an unscheduled time locking the door behind them might fool the system and prevent security from pinning down the location of the intruders every bit of uncertainty on the part of the guards increased the chances of smooth extraction the corridor was empty except for the runners luckily everything had gone according to plan so far they waited for sika signal to proceed with the main objective out of the way the troll job was to lead them out of the complex by different route in order to confuse the pursuit without access to the floor plans of the high security areas the decker was forced to use the building internal system to piece together map of the complex sika had been monitoring the team progress to the lab but was unable to access the room equipment because it was isolated during nonworking hours he breathed sigh of relief when he viewed through video pickup the runners exiting the lab sika flicked the lights just east of the team signaling that the corridor was clear he watched them slip down the hall toward stairwell just to the north of their location the route to the stairs wound through several hallways running like labyrinths through the research area this floor layout was designed to confuse anyone not familiar with the area and slow them down it was rumored that the aztec leopard guards trained in corridors like these to practice repelling espionage attempts finally the runners came to the door leading to the stairs it was thick black metal edged with yellow caution stripes jinga stooped to examine the door knob checking for hidden locks or alarms it would not be good to alert the aztec to their presence when they were this close to getting out small hole was set in the center of the knob the orc could not tell if it was lock or not deveaux take look at this the orc beckoned for the detective to check out the door is that lock he leaned toward the door eyeing the hole do nt know could be oh wonderful watkins spoke for the first time since they had left the lab why do nt you just open the door and find out the mage said sardonically got better ways than that to see after all this ai nt my first time out the detective grinned at the mage and went back to work he pulled out small flashlight and switched it on the black door seemed to suck up the light when deveaux pointed the light at it he peered into the hole trying to discern any hidden circuitry or mechanisms smiling deveaux put away the light this is an easy one the detective reached into his jumpsuit pulling out pen with twist needle like blade flicked out of the end watch and learn kiddies he spit on the end of the blade and slid it into the hole in the knob sparks shot from the lock and the runners heard it click little piece of advice folks never leave any bare wire it just makes things to easy jinga laughed at the detective joke but the mage just fumed at the ease with which deveaux had jimmied the lock every time the mage assumed the detective was backwoods moron the cajun proved him wrong watkins did not like being wrong jinga entered the stairwell first his hk at the ready deveaux followed the samurai with his pistol raised then it was bishop turn he slipped into the stairwell ready to launch spell if called for the rear was brought up by watkins he moved carelessly as if we was more worried about what he was going to have for dinner rather than if they were going to get caught deveaux noticed the mage bearing and turned to caution him before the words left his mouth the door to the stairwell swung closed the sound reverberating throughout the stairwell jinga head snapped around thinking that there was trouble behind them the mage stood with disinterested look on his face unapologetic and bored are you cracked jinga hissed watch the noise ya doink eat drek tusker nobody heard it you better hope so or you die first ll make sure jinga face was twisted in snarl it sent ripples down bishop spine just seeing the samurai anger the faceoff between the two runners lasted several seconds before jinga broke is off the orc spun around and began leaping up the stairs two at time deveaux struggled unsuccessfully to keep up with the samurai pace he soon fell behind gasping for breath and stopping at each landing to rest watkins easily outdistanced bishop who was already tired from casting his spell back at the lab the mage soon caught up with the detective and passed him by without word as the mage passed him deveaux shook his head bishop caught the detective on the third landing and they both stopped for moment concern showed in the detectives eyes the enmity between jinga and the mage had been present all along but deveaux could not understand why watkins had chosen that particular moment to bring it to the surface he had assumed watkins was professional and up until now he had nt given the detective any reason to doubt it however he actions in the last several minutes did not jibe with the mage previous behavior he was acting like an amateur the move almost seemed calculated bishop shrugged thinking the same thing if the orc got too caught up in the battle of wills he could get careless mistake now could cost all of the runners their lives what is going on rick bishop managed between gasps hell if know bishop seems our boy is nt as slick as we thought where the hell did sika dig him up have never seen him on the streets before just assumed he was reliable if sika hired him it was nt sika he is kramer chummer what bishop did not like that kramer was not adept at dealing with runners and could have been easily duped why did nt sika say something guess he figured it was nt important he did have me dig some before he ok him he ai nt no dirtier than any of us but he is nt one of us bishop was cut short by the thunder of gunfire resounding in the stairwell the echoes made it impossible to determine how many people were firing but however many it was they were going full auto bishop raced up the stairs with deveaux behind him the two runners flew up the stairs with renewed energy their systems pumping adrenaline bishop turned corner and nearly stumbled over watkins the mage was curled up into ball hugging the steel banister just above the landing the sound of gunfire was louder and more frequent here after sidestepping the mage and carefully mounting the remaining steps bishop could see jinga the orc hk was spewing stream of bullets up toward the exit the firing was dying off as jinga carefully controlled his firing to preserve his ammunition bishop hazarded look around the curve of the stairwell and saw several bodies lying in front of the steel door leading out of the stairwell the door peaked open and the shaman saw the barrel of rifle emerge and fire in jinga direction the orc sent the shooter scurrying back with burst of well placed shots sensing break in the action bishop leaped to his feet and took place next to the samurai he pulled his predator from inside his jacket and chambered round how biz jinga the orc did not seem to notice the shaman until he spoke could be better took couple when they jumped me for the first time bishop noticed spreading red stain on the orc left leg it was nt serious wound but it had to hurt like hell human would have probably been disabled by large caliber round in the thigh but orcs tended to be tougher than most humans and jinga was tough even for an orc fuzz jumped as jinga fired his rifle again sending another wouldbe attacker scrambling for cover as the gunman retreated deveaux reached the runners position hoi jinga you look little busy no thanks to that fraggin mage where the hell is he deveaux and bishop looked at each other but did nt respond picking up on the unspoken communication jinga spit hiding just like damn rat warned sika bishop tried to head off the argument is that the only way out yep the detective nodded and it gon na be mean now they know we here bishop did not know what to say next the first question that came to his mind was to ask what had happened he had better sense than to accuse jinga of having itchy finger while trapped in the stairwell the time for recriminations was after the mission was complete right now the group main concern was getting out of the complex with as little contact with the security forces as possible they seemed to be aware of the fake uniforms that the runners wore so stealth was now major concern well jinga broke the silence any ideas straight up and out boys before they get more troops on our butts bishop and jinga sighed but they knew deveaux was right if they did not get away soon the entire aztechnology security force would be waiting for them when they tried to make break for the fence if the runners were going to do something they had to do it soon jinga nodded and held up his hand blood from his wound covered his callused hands as he counted down on his fingers when the last finger went down the runners leapt to their feet and rushed up the last flight of stairs just as the orc reached the landing the metal door began to swing open but jinga slammed it shut in guard face with kick from his huge foot he sent hail of bullets pointblank through the door and ripped it open two uniformed guards lay in the corridor clutching various wounds another was slumped unconscious against the far wall blood streaming down his face from broken nose inflicted by jinga kick to the door there was no sign of further resistance bishop turned to retrieve the mage from the stairwell but before he took two steps he felt heavy hand on his shoulder bishop where do you think you are going to get watkins we ca nt leave him here why not he knew the risks when he took the job say let the aztecs take care of him the orc was in no mood to play guardian angel to the peevish mage and let him spill his guts about us he has point jinga the detective said ok go get him ll keep an eye out here do nt want those aztecs showing up at my flat with mad on jinga released the shaman shoulder and turned to watch the corridor bishop nearly flew down the stairs to get the mage but when he reached the place the mage had been cowering the mage was nowhere to be found watkins must have panicked and gone back the way they had come bishop checked his pistol again and started down the stairs again the stairwell was silent except for the sound of his sneakers slapping on the concrete stairs as he made his way down he descended the stairs until he reached the level of the lab he stepped over to the door and was about to open it when he heard voices coming from the other side the sound of several men arguing clearly carried through the steel door but their words were muffled to the point where bishop was unable to make out what the men were saying the only obvious thing was that either watkins had gone even farther underground or he was now in the hands of the aztechnology security forces either way he was beyond the shaman ability to help the only thing bishop could do now was save his own skin with renewed vigor brought on by the thought of capture bishop hurtled up the stairs two at time he reached the top and did not stop running he burst into the corridor and collided with the orc who was crouched down both runners ended up in tangle on the floor the orc cursed and extracated himself from the mess he looked down at the shaman with an angry scowl on his face what the hell is your problem thought you were bringing the mage with ya bishop sat up and shook his head to clear it the collision with the sturdy orc had stunned him after few moments bishop recovered enough to sputter response he gone think they got him good riddance say jinga snapped one less person to split the loot with there may not be any loot to split the troops may be on their way up right now if we want to get out of here we had better move it bishop cursed the lack of direct link with sika their group decker if they could talk to him they would have better idea of where the security forces were the only thing sika could do now was nudge them in the right direction the runners had sacrificed more direct connection to the decker in favor of more subtle approach they were paying for it now deveaux cursed and cocked his pistol as he caught the sound of lot of boots stamping up the stairs the had just climbed jinga and fuzz looked at each other and dismissed their anger the aztec troops on their way up the stairs were the most direct threat to the team any personal quarrels could be settled later without warning the lights in the stairwell blinked out this was answered be curses from with the stairwell as if in response the area was filled with sharp hissing as the chemical fire extinguishers installed throughout the stairwell were switched on sika you slick fragger jinga cheered the troll decker had found way to aid the runners during their escape using the complex internal systems the troll was using the building against the aztecs with their hope renewed the runners dashed down the corridor guns at the ready and made their way toward the service exit where they were supposed to pick up mr kramer his extraction was the only portion of the mission that the runners had not completed yet but in some ways it was the most important if they were unable to get him out the payoff would be sizably less the group passed through several empty hallways before coming to dark section in service corridor while jinga and bishop watched for guards deveaux tried the door it was unlocked and swung open at the detectives touch the inside of the room was dark and deveaux could nt see into the room more than few feet he struggled for moment to make out the shadowy shapes in the room but gave up he searched for light switch and after flicking it on and off decided it was useless sika must have shut off the power to the room jinga need your eyes ll watch the hall the orc grunted and slipped into the room deveaux switched places with the samurai taking up post next to bishop in the hall do ya see anything jinga at first the orc did not reply then low growl started in the back of his throat it rumbled deep down in the orc chest and grew to yell the shout startled the other runners and they whirled around to see what had upset the orc lights came on in the room revealing group of armored men standing with their weapons in line with the orc the armor was painted in yellowish spotted pattern that resembled the pelt of leopard emanating from small spotlights mounted on the left shoulder of the armor the halogen lamps shined into jinga eyes blinding him temporarily the armor covered almost their entire body lending the troops an inhuman appearance their faces were covered by boxy helmets with reflective face shields the helmets probably gave the guards the same ability to see in the dark as jinga had both runners whirled around at the shout of the orc scream they only glimpsed the guards for moment before they extinguished their spotlights sika chose that instant to return the power to the room lights his wired reflexes just bit faster than those of the leopard guards jinga hit the floor and rolled to the left of the doorway his hk spat teflon jacketed rounds into the gathered troopers sending them into disarray his eyesight adjusting after the dramatic change in lighting deveaux pulled the trigger of his pistol sending the guards into further confusion magic coursed through bishop fuzz as he called upon the power of his totem to help dispatch he guards energy crackled from bishop left hand where ball of light grew he reached out toward the guards and released the ball of magical energy if flew toward the group bursting as it struck one particularly unlucky man his armor smoked and melted where the sphere had struck he reeled back and landed in pile on the floor the rest of the aztec scattered trying to find cover from the runners murderous fire bishop thought he could make out the shape of someone without armor diving behind row of steel storage lockers most of the aztec guards took up defensive positions behind the desks and file cabinets that filled the maintenance office after moment they began to return fire bishop and deveaux ducked back out of the doorway to avoid the hail of bullets jinga was not as lucky although his prone position made it difficult for the guards to fire at the samurai from behind their cover the guards shot wildly hoping to strike the orc with lucky shot jinga cried out in pain as another bullet impacted with his already injured leg the shaman heard the orc cry and peaked in to see if he could help the orc growled angrier than bishop had every seen him and jumped to his feet he charged the desk the guards were using for cover oblivious to the bullets flying all around him jinga staggered from several hits that failed to penetrate his kevlar jacket but kept racing toward the desk he hit it with crash sending the guards behind it skidding into the lockers directly behind them jinga continued to push the desk with all of his might shouldering it back toward the lockers the guards tried to scramble out of the way of the steel and flesh juggernaut but few were unsuccessful the heavy desk smashed into the lockers pinning three guards still leaning into the desk jinga raised his rifle and peppered the trapped men with armor piercing rounds shards of ballistic plastic flew in every direction as the orc gun chewed the guards to pieces one of the guards who had escaped his companion fate steadied his autorifle and aimed it at the raging orc intent on putting few rounds into his unprotected head the leopard guard shuddered as well placed shot from deveaux pistol burrowed into his neck where the helmet and the chest armor met with the danger of hitting their own men in crossfire eliminated the guards on the opposite side of the room opened up on the orc street samurai his armored jacket absorbed most of the punishment but several rounds found its way into the orc flesh sending him to the floor in heap satisfied that the major threat had been eliminated the troopers emerged from behind their cover ready to fire at the other runners so intent on eliminating the remaining runners the guards forgot about jinga fighting to stay conscious the orc waited for them to pass him by with their backs to him he opened fire once again deveaux and bishop recognized the sound of jinga hk peered into the room and added their firepower to catch the guards in grinding crossfire that made short work of the armored troopers as the last guard fell shadowy form slipped out from behind the row of lockers bishop began to raise his pistol but stopped when he realized it was the missing mage watkins thank the powers how did you get away bishop walked forward to greet the mage escape what on earth do you mean did nt escape bishop was puzzled by the mage words but all of his confusion evaporated as watkins produced nasty looking shotgun from within his long jacket the game is over you are pinched now drop the guns bishop and deveaux complied with the order but jinga refused you bloody pink skin you work for them jinga launched himself at the mage and knocked the shotgun aside pellets skittered off of the metal lockers filling the room with tinny rattle the gun spun out of the mage grasp landing in the corner of the room amidst the carnage the orc face split in gruesome smile and he raised his rifle pressing it against the mage forehead he pulled the trigger the rifled answered with hollow click out of ammunition the mage reached out grabbing the orc massive arm and tired to grapple with the samurai jinga laughed at watkins puny fighting skills but his humor was cut short pain shot up his left arm sending sheets of fire through his nerves the agony brought the orc to his knees magic flowed from the mage hands and into jinga arm slowly the flesh began to melt off of the bones then the bones liquefied leaving behind hideous soup of putrid tissue bishop snatched up his predator from the floor and leveled it at watkins it bucked in his hands as he pulled the trigger one of the rounds flew high starling the mage the other slammed into his shoulder watkins released what was left of jinga arm the mage twisted away from the shot and the orc slammed to the floor staggered by the round impact the mage wobbled as he rushed for cover behind the row of lockers the runners heard the opening of door and the sound of watkins footsteps receding into he night the shattered remains of an entire team of elite aztechnology leopard troops lay scattered around the room the runners did not have time to gloat over their success bishop was too concerned about jinga the orc clawed at the remains of his ruined arm the destruction had stopped midway up his forearm but blood continued to flow from the wound bishop centered his thoughts and focused his remaining shamanistic powers on healing spell to staunch the flow of blood from jinga arm the detective ripped the fake security uniform off and tore strips of cloth to use as makeshift bandages their combined effort finally succeeded in stopping the flow of blood from the orc arm the two runners helped the orc to his feet he nearly collapsed as the pain from his wounded leg slashed up his spine gritting his teeth jinga staggered forward leaning on bishop for support deveaux stepped around the row of lockers careful of an ambush by the mage he kicked open the door it slammed open to reveal crumpled body at first the detective though it might be watkins but after kneeling down to examine it he discovered it was mr kramer the man they were supposed to extract from the employ of the aztechnology he checked for pulse but found none kramer was bound and gagged trussed up like christmas present clean finger sized hole marred his otherwise normal face the edges of the wound were cauterized as if by laser the wound probably came from custom weapon designed to dispatch its victim quickly and quietly waving away the faint smell of burnt flesh deveaux motioned for the runners to proceed half dragging jinga bishop fuzz trotted out of the building following the detective into the relative cover of the manicured trees surrounding the complex main building jinga let out loan moan at each step bishop felt badly for his friend the pain from the mage spell must have been excruciating the runners squatted just inside the line of trees watching for signs of more pursuit if the bodies in the office were discovered the entire complex would go on alert it seemed that the plan so far had been to limit the knowledge of the breakin in order to deal with it without it becoming widely known it would not look good if the public discovered the ease with which group of shadowrunners was able to breach the lofty aztechnology security net and come very near to escaping with valuable data this worked in the runners favor as long as the alert was limited they had chance of slipping out past the normal security precautions trying to make it out with the maxitaxi as planned was out of the question if watkins was still alive he would have that exit blocked the gate where the runners had entered was probably being watched as well their only choice was to throw out all of their plans and try to out think their pursuers the unpredictability might be enough to give the runners the edge while bishop tended to the injured orc deveaux tried to recall as much as he could about the maps he had used to plan the original assault he struggled to remember as many details as possible he knew for sure that the stand of trees that they were hiding in surrounded the entire complex broken only by occasional foot paths and wider breaks allowing traffic to pass through the walls surrounding the complex were tall but not impassable they were designed to keep unwanted visitors out by delaying them long enough for guards to arrive and deal with the problem jinga was the big problem in his condition he would never be able to make it over the wall without help and bishop and deveaux were far too week to aid the heavy orc over the wall getting past the wall was the hardest part of escaping once out the runners could easily lose themselves in the crowds outside the complex even though it was late in the evening seattle never slept throngs of people passed up and down the streets surrounding the aztechnology willing to fulfill all of the corps employees needs and desires sub cultures dedicated to sating people dark sides inevitably sprang up around large arcologies allowing the residents to express their baser instincts without fear of becoming entangled in the corporation regulations it had been much the same during the previous century with military bases surrounded by bars and brothels suddenly deveaux got an idea he called bishop over and explained the plan as quickly as he could after finishing his whispered instruction the detective rushed off into the trees heading for the south wall as he watched the detective disappear into the darkness he checked jinga condition the orc breathing was more regular but his face was pale almost the color of aged ivory his eyes were closed and his jaw was set against the pain fuzz decided to let the orc rest for moment before they had to set out toward the south wall by the time they got there fuzz hoped deveaux would have completed his part of the plan and the runners would be on their way out of the complex after pausing just long enough for jinga to catch his breath bishop urged him forward they wended their way through the trees careful not to stray on to any of the paths set aside for the corp workers recreation finally the wall came into view it was eight feet tall and topped with decorative looking spikes bishop knew that the spikes were for more than show the could easily pierce careless intruder as the runners neared the wall the trees grew more sparse he area directly bordering the wall was devoid of vegetation making it difficult to find cover the only thing left to do was wait bishop prayed to his totem that they were in the right place the wall was several city blocks long and deveaux could choose almost any part of it to breach if they were lucky it would be close to their position jinga was near the end of his endurance minutes passed seeming to take an eternity the silence was broken only by the orc labored breathing every so often bishop caught snatch of sound from the other side of the wall the sound of people shouting mingled with the rush of traffic passing along the street outside for an instant bishop thought he could hear the shouts grow just bit more insistent but he dismissed it as his imagination the shaman attention was drawn back to the injured orc by renewed series of moans if deveaux did nt act soon the orc might not live long enough to enjoy his share of the take just when bishop had resigned himself to the orc death the sound of screams burst from the other side of the wall the curses were soon followed by the sound of revving engine the engine bellowed deep growl the growl of large truck the sound moved closer eliciting more curses form the gathered crowd smile spread across bishop face the sound could only mean one thing deveaux had found their ticket out bishop hefted the big orc to his feet and waited for deveaux to complete his plan just as bishop was able to steady jinga the wall several meters away exploded in spray of ferrocrete the nose of heavy transport truck emerged through the rubble like an armadillo burrowing through dirt the detective was perched in the cab motioning to the other runners with his pistol let go folks lone star is gon na be here any time bishop helped jinga up into the cab of the truck and quickly followed him in before bishop could even swing the door shut deveaux threw the truck into reverse and gunned the engine the truck rumbled away from the wall sending up another cloud of ferrocrete dust horns sounded as the truck backed into the traffic passing the compound but the detective ignored them concentrating on keeping an eye out for pursuit soon the sound of the sirens faded into the distance leaving the cab of the truck strangely silent the two runners eyed the motionless orc their faces filled with concern is he gon na make it bishop deveaux normally jovial manner was missing honestly do nt know rick bishop shook his head am out of spells and his is pretty shocky if we do nt get him to body shop he is flat lined the closest is seattle general but that the first place they are gon na look is he gon na make it to hmo he gon na have to without another word deveaux headed the truck toward hmo the few extra blocks seemed to add an eternity to the trip finally the building came into sight deveaux drove the truck up onto the pavement right up to the door get him out got ta loose this monster the detective sped off with the truck as soon as bishop had jinga free the shaman dragged the orc inside and shouted for help doctors materialized everywhere taking jinga from bishops arms one especially burly human lifted the orc on to gurney and began rolling him into the back room of the ward his disappeared though pair of swinging doors surrounded by frantic group of doctors bishop eyed the crowd in the lobby of the hmo and slipped into the restroom he entered one of the stalls and sat down on the toilet the last bit of energy flowed out of him as his adrenaline rush ebbed the fatigue brought on by the spells and the mission tumbled down on bishop shoulders all at once he almost swooned he sat there for what seemed like hours until he heard the door of the restroom open excuse me are you the one who brought in the orc bishop sprang to his feet and his hand flew to the gun stuffed in his waistband he pushed open the door of the stall and peered out doctor in soiled scrubs stood in the doorway with look of consolation on his face did you bring in the orc he asked again yes bishop answered how is he the doctor paused for moment am sorry but we were unable to save his hand after another pause he continued he is stable now but the tissue damage was to extensive to reconstruct the limb we had to remove it below the elbow relief washed over bishop one look at jinga arm had told bishop that it was nt salvageable but he was alive knowing jinga he would see this as chance to pick up one of the deadlier prosthesis on the black market bishop knew that the orc was going to be fine but he was going to be hell on fire to finish what he had started on watkins however that was going to be another run in the shadows the end
