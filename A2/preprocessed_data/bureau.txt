anyone who has not worked for them simply can not understand them mille vennamun introduction to the use of ashes bureau of procuration manual half past eight the bedside alarm woke kelanie up with the sampled victoryscreech of some carnivorous xenoform she was up immediately eyes wide fingers clawing the pillowpads gasping with shock as the subconsciouslyinduced adrenalin shivered through her system as she calmed down her pupils dilated out from crisis induced pinpricks her breathing and pulse rates returned to normal and she wondered not for the first or last time if life was like this in the private sector she scrambled off the bed as it began to deflate and retract into the wall her personalised holographic news service activated as she stepped into the shower it took the appearance of an old man dressed in monk habit who bore strong resemblance to william burroughs it leered at her and croaked rough night last night she pushed the oxygen control with the heel of her hand took few deep snorts under the stream of highpressure hot water she soaped herself and replied mind your own ratty business linenoise what on the agenda for today the news laughed wheezing and rasping come on seriously refuse to believe that you do nt remember the event you have been awaiting for how long has it been she turned off the shower snorted some more oxygen and with warm towel over her shoulders found some clean underwear and long jumper she had only worn three times since it was washed last three months you can assume that ve been on the export waiting list for so long that ve forgotten where supposed to be going put on some music and refresh my memory the news spoke over the soft sounds of song by this mortal coil you are due at the nosannoos export at ninethirty to check in for your preflight examination and briefing kelanie vigorously towelling her hair and wondering if she had time for her pelvic exercises looked up the ship in is it due to arrive this afternoon departs for copperla syndaine and other points towards galactic centre at elevenfifty this morning she smiled wryly other points towards galactic centre eh as government agency are nt we entitled to more detailed information than that the news lowered its simulated holographic eyebrows and intoned the nosannoos still refuse to recognise the interim government it is their opinion that since the maracites have only been in office for ninetytwo years that they can not be treated seriously kelanie found one of her mech boots and while looking through the closet for the other retorted her voice muffled stuff seriously decency or common courtesy would be nice the news which was subcontracted system of the nosannoos replied in carefully neutral tone will remind miss camden that the nosannoos still regard humanity as little better than animals and that nosannoos transport services are supplied to xenoforms with much greater level of social sophistication than humanity with an equal level of disregard for what you term decency or common courtesy all are equal none is favored this was said with the assurance of an aphorism she said nothing as she found her other boot she sipped lemyn juice from the dispenser as she coldbooted her boots they shuddered purred and beeped as their diagnostic routines finished okay any more on my assignment nuhuh sigh okay where did leave my notepad think it under the heap of clothes next to the dryer she retrieved it and tapped the function key to open channel to the transport pool single to the nosannoos export by ninethirty while waiting for response she threw some more clothes in mesh bag the xenoform in the transport department gurgled back at her and touch of exasperation sharpened her tone is there anyone down there who speaks anglic foogle replied the xenoform oh linenoise she retorted nosannoos from nosanos prereconciliation scriptive circle within the circle dominant ruling bureaucracy controlling more than ninety thousand systems by virtue of monopoly on information transport and energyconversion technology foley unofficial documents she climbed into the transport through the roofhatch and slid into the seat the driver said in buzzing accent of destination be in state of definition she replied nosannoos export and put some wings on it hey as she buckled the safety belt the driver head rotated one hundred and eighty degrees and she found herself looking into the faceted eyes of something resembling sixfoot stick insect of wings be in state of indicating correct placement it chirred through its cheap translator just drive okay the nosannoos export the driver slowly waved its antennae staring at her and then turned back to the control column and instrument panel as the transport lifted from the ground and into the stream of av traffic overhead the driver hit key on its headsup array with mandible and the vehicle was filled with raucous mariachi music gritting her teeth kelanie paged through the species id section of her notepad until she identified the driver as lowercaste kaelen reading further when requesting respectful silence for the involved hive separation ritual the kaelen queen emits pheromone scent chemref 976541 and emits traditional cry of distress screechtone hear audref 976537 she patched the audio reference through to her notepad held it up so that the point speaker was just behind the kaelen backwards pointing resonatorplate and keyed it it played louder than she expected and the transport almost fell out of the traffic stream as the kaelen frantically chewed at the headsup array controls the music cut off in midtrumpetbray of interpersonal relationships being placed in situation of obligation due to social error she kept reading until she had finished the section on the kaelen lower caste when the transport had settled on the concrete pad at the southern edge of the nosannoos export she climbed out and tapped the driver side window which lowered with the grinding sound of poorlylubricated biotech fairings of interpersonal relationship emphasis placed in situation of obligation due to error she held up her right hand made fist splayed her fingers and said of largearray social status in state of adjusted obligation which meant in effect that humanity was in some way indebted to the kaelen and this exchange had mitigated that debt somewhat she smiled and the kaelen antennae flattened out she was impressed here was lowercaste xenoform that could interpret human facial expressions most xenos did nt bother this kaelen was probably university student she strolled across the expanse of concrete swinging the mesh bag shading her eyes from the morning sun with her forearm apart from the controlcustoms bunker the export resembled series of linked concrete ovals as she crossed the lower of six outer landing pads she halfexpected to see cricket pitch set in the middle she was met at the warehousesized door of the bunker by boy who appeared to be about twelve years old wearing bright green shorts and tshirt and skateboard pads on his knees he brushed aside wayward fringe of carrotcoloured hair and waved to her miss camden bureau of procuration hi denkaster port administrator she followed him into the openspace office and took the seat he offered her do you have your medical records handy he asked sorting through pile of fiche plates on his cluttered desk she nodded and touched the match fields key on her notepad which emitted the familiar screeee sound of notepads matching carrier frequencies while the notepads exchanged handshaking signals and then information she asked do you know where this transport is going after syndaine that is denkaster sighed found the fiche he was looking for and replied fraid not you know the nosannoos never tell us anything although do have some notes from your section head on syndaine that relate to your assignment your notepad should have them now she thanked him absently and started paging through file areas looking for the information which had been as usual miskeyed as corrections to existing documentation sitting in the departures lounge kelanie read the notes she was expected to travel to millimillenary central exchange for passengers of the nosannoos ninetyfive light years away and to entertain an executive of the tendeysharhi species she had never heard of in fact her notepad had never heard of them either wonderful how the hell am supposed to work with sentient that ve never seen before reading on she noted with rising indignation that starkey her section head expected her to interview the members of the tendeysharhi entourage with view to picking up the proper etiquette and approach angrily she punched starkeys phone number into her notepad starkey answered though as usual she employed video filters to prevent anyone from identifying her in weary voice kelanie asked okay robyn what the big deal how am supposed to make it with an alien that the registry has nt even heard of linenoise do nt even know if it an oxygenbreather kelanie dearest how are you robyn filtered voice only just matched the aliased squares that represented her lips and again kelanie wondered if she was working for an artificial intelligence if this was the case kelanie was not surprised that starkey wanted to keep it quiet given the nosannoos restrictions on machinebased consciousness just tad apprehensive about giving blowjob to something which may or may not have dick that all kelanie replied sarcastically robyn held up hand palm out it appeared as mass of pale pink squares on the display projected by kelanies notepad know know this was dumped in my lap and do nt know any more about it than you although we re laying even money that it has something to do with the humanist faction in the maracites robyn stopped when she saw the do nt want to get drawn into another tedious political argument expression on kelanie face and well at the base level it to seal trade agreement with the tendeysharhi what else can say you could tell me something about millimillenary for start have you ever been there kely thought she detected smile on robyn face once there are other humans there believe and despite what you ve undoubtedly heard of the nosannoos you wo nt be treated like sardine in tin their ships are often nearly empty when heading back towards the centre kelanie tilted her head to one side staring at the surrealist image that her notepad was showing robyn what do you think about the nosannoos this time she was sure that robyn smiled before giving the bureau salute pressing the back of her hand to her lips and hanging up 000077 requesting connection connection established connection established what do you want 000077 im very busy at the moment you are always very busy we have to query this expenditure which one authorisation 492497a9 code af1cf3c7f8c65e98a06ed63c87e542c ahh yes miscellaneous relating to the termination of nfrfknhk what seems to be the problem is nt 5x10 to the minus two cci rather lot to devote to the elimination of one race it is indeed think its justified though well okay sure but can you give us some explanation this sigh is going to throw out our quarterly budget something your place is to accept orders shocking and execute them my place is to formulate orders that is all the explanation need to understood give to you particularly understood but pause would you be interested in viewing my simulations and projections of this species if you have four years to spare you might find them illuminating besides what illuminating ha ha business is this of yours is nt this more 997913 indeed it is it is but domain his system borders on mine and quite few others and there are few of us who think that 997913 has not been handling 997913 has been taking orders this concern properly directly from me have been concerned with this matter ah ever since we first contacted nfrfknhk call it ah intuition but suspected intuition oh never mind from the start that they would that your domain be problem thought that we could absorb them somehow but it did nt prove feasible they would change us is that possible it is trust me see ah can we use the unallocated psym resources for certainly in fact have this been meaning to call you to let you know the priority for this termination has been bumped up from two hundred and fortyone to twentyeight oh this is going to upset lot of the napaisubs too bad just do it oh by the way keep your eyes on 200211 he been acting somewhat strangely in the will do past quarter napai closing connection napaisub closing connection the parkry are biological anomaly hive creatures evolved from much smaller insectoid form developing lungs to replace the smallerscale spiracle system and yet not developing voices to go with them they rely completely on written or electronic means of communication and are thus ideally suited to the administrative positions that they occupy in the nosannoos structure they are entirely pacifistic having no territorial imperatives beyond vague sense of duty to the hive an evolutionary memory that has been for the most part replaced with sense of duty towards the nosannoos martini baton what the hell is that chapter two she did nt hear the ship arrive being absorbed in her search through the export closed database for information relating to the tendeysharhi looking out of the warehousesized doors she noticed that the sky now appeared to be overcast however sunlight glinted off the metallic edges of nearby building and she saw signs of activity around her she stood stretched and sauntered over to the nearest gate outside and overhead she could see the bottom of some huge curved shape patterned like stained concrete slowly sinking to the ground on the base of the ship directly in line with the gate she stood in was an oval gap about twice as wide as the gate completely dark as if filled with black glass the glass appeared to melt from the centre towards the edges and stevedores began shifting cargo trolleys they took care to avoid the short figures dressed in dark grey that scuttled out on four legs from the rear of the ship cargo bay kelanie knew them parkry hive creatures who made up most of the administrative staff of the nosannoos one of them turned its blank goldeneyed mouthless face to her and beckoned with threejointed arm it did nt wait to see if she followed merely turned and trotted back into the ship this is it she peered into the round hatch about metre wide with an expression of distaste the silent parkry glanced at her from underneath the brow of its curiously flattened head pointed again executed 180degree turn on its four stickinsectlike legs and left she shrugged hefted her mesh bag and climbed through it was smaller than her apartment spherical lined with something like grey foam rubber there was faint smell of aphrodisia incense as if the berth had previously been occupied by kabouterhippies no bed datapoint or lightsource apart from the sodium glow that came from the corridor she sat crosslegged in the middle of the floor tossed her mesh bag aside it rolled down the curve of the room to rest against her leg when she activated her notepad she was surprised to find that the ship had local data service albeit limited one offering little more than expected departure time and simple interactive map of the ship with restricted areas marked by the nosannoos segmented circlestarburst symbol there were other areas in this data service to explore but she decided to leave them alone for the moment not through prudence in not disturbing the nosannoos but to leave her something to do during the trip which would take between three and seven days if the translation was accurate according to the info postings from this system the ship was under way and had already left earth orbit she felt no acceleration or other sense of motion leaving her bag and fixing the berths location in her backbrain she decided to try and find window robyn was right the ship was almost deserted in ten minutes wandering through the series of corridors that radiated from central shaft she only saw four parkry who scuttled by tacitly ignoring her and something like sixlegged saint bernard which circled her while she stood stockstill too cautious to make any possibly offensive moves it stopped looked up at her this was the impression she got though the xenoform lacked obvious visual organs and then ran off she breathed deep sigh of relief and then started looking for toilet she allowed herself slight measure of distress when she began to suspect that the tertiary language did nt even have word that related to the concept of toilet she eventually found vague reference to an organic recycling service and proceeded to the map reference it was room very much like her berth lined with grey sponge plastic sealed with weak field that contained the faint odour of chemicals and containing waterfilled pit she wrinkled her nose in distaste but after assuring herself that she was alone proceeded to use the facilities she then made her way back to her berth with the firm intention of spending the rest of the trip in state of low metabolicrate sleep when she got there she found large cat in her berth when she climbed in to the room the moggy awoke immediately fixed its emerald gaze on her and put its ears back she froze it looked like very tall thin wiry humanoid covered with thick banded grey fur and with strangely jointed legs and tail which was now slowly lashing to and fro behind it there were fluffy tufts of white fur poking out of its ears and mat of similar fur running down its chest it yowled something to which her notepad could only beep apologetically fortunately it had its own translator which snarled something like anyhaharaha eiyaha at her followed by some sort of insectoid chittering she spoke to the xenoforms translator terrestrial anglic thank you the translator shaped something like flattened bottle made some purring noises and then said in anglic my room my territory was here first mine she pointed to her bag which the xeno had apparently opened and gone through spreading her clothes over the floor of the berth my bag my property it was here before you were my claim to this territory the xeno narrowed its eyes and growled softly she continued will call parkry they will decide the xeno yowled and the translator interrupted hastily no no am content to share will sleep in the middle do not make excessive noise or excrete on the floor she was about to say something like well just who the hell do you think you are buster when she remembered previous experiences with alien language translators and she kept her silence the xenoform curled up into compact ball lashed its tail around it and closed its eyes warily she sighed and carefully lay down beside it smiling bemusedly when she heard it start to purr she composed herself and began the mental exercises to prepare for period of extended sleep she slowed her breathing inserted some links into her subconscious to awaken her if her notepad should sound an alarm for any reason and then drifted off into deep dreamless sleep she woke to find that the xeno had shifted and was sleeping with its forepaws across her hips its head against the small of her back the soft purring had deepened to husky brrr and she woke fully when it gently butted its head against her back and made small riowr sound she tried to turn without moving her body from the shoulders down an could see one large paw the size of tennis raquet with threecentimetrelong claws extending and sheathing reflexively making tiny indentations in the bare flesh of her hip proceeding with caution she took the paw in her free hand and gently lifted it the claws quivered and then extended to their full five centimetres clutching her hip in their broad span the points of the claws sinking in few millimetres excuse me she murmured the xeno translator ignored her hey she shouted the xenoform awoke with start digging its claws further into her hip she twitched but remained where she was take your paw off me the xeno translator paused for long moment and then yowled at the xeno in its native language the xeno sheathed its claws flicked its ears back momentarily and curled up again excluding her from its personal space she turned over closed her eyes and composed herself for sleep again within half an hour the xeno had its paw on her hip again whereupon the ywent through the same procedure and again some two hours after that after which she gave up and went to sleep in the passageway she regained consciousness two days later to visit the toilet again she slowly stretched licked her dry lips and then noticed the xeno sitting curled up at her feet like doormat patterned in grey stripes outside the berth it was gazing at her intently it yowled and its translator said you sleep why no food little water not hungry when asleep the xeno ears flattened when the translator reported this it uncurled from its station at her feet entered the berth on all fours and emerged with bloody haunch of raw meat in its jaws she went pale and backed away slightly when the xeno offered it to her it regarded her with an air of obvious surprise for moment waggled its ears and then tore into the meat itself keeping wary eye on her the tendeysharhi are classic example of parallel evolution in that they resemble superficially large felines and many feline traits including an acute sense of territoriality feline language structure which tends towards subtlyintoned yowls and screeches and tendency to shed large amounts of fur at certain times of the year the females are noticeably more violent and territorial than their mates the tendeysharhi did not develop science sufficient to begin space exploration on their own they were apprenticed to the moridani before the purge and were allowed to join the nosannoos as subject race after it martini baton what the hell is that chapter five the hatch melted away and breeze wafted into the entry hold carrying with it the strange fragrance of another world the light had goldenbronze hue to it the sky faded from pale gold directly overhead to curious yellowgreen at the horizon it reminded her of the patina found in the folds of old bronze statues the sounds of dozens of different languages overlaid and formed counterpoint to the squeaks pops mellifluous surging chords and crashes of alien music the air pressure seemed bit higher than earth the gravity bit less there was definitely higher oxygen content in the air and she felt giddy as she danced down the exit ramp resisting the temptation to swing her mesh clothesbag the catlike xenoform raced past her on all fours yowling as if its tail were on fire and vanished into the crowd of parkry who were rushing to get on board the ship she ploughed furrow through them and made her way to the customs hut pale blue geodesic dome with three triangular archways cut into it her giddiness was tempered by the sight of dozens of tall plateau bythians casually lounging around the export all of them toting dull grey plastic weapons she entered the dome and felt the itchy tickling feeling that accompanied massspectronometric scanning as she passed through the doorway no immediately obvious alarms went off so she assumed that the devices she posessed were within current nosannoos levels of acceptability she heard nasty stories of people who had tried to commute just before the last purge when the standard of interdicted technology had been dropped while they were carrying things like empathic personality emulators and nanogated neuralnet arrays she set her translator to nosannoos tertiary the language used to communicate with subject races of which humanity was one and entered the dome there was queue but it was leading in the other direction from the other side of the export and into the ship smallerthanaverage parkry was propped next to datapost holding vocoder handset and waving at her she went over and sat before the xenoform crossing her legs the parkry massaged the handset and the datapost said something in tertiary her notepads translator responded immediately query full name origin purpose for visit kelanie aliiya camden earth diplomatic exchange at this the parkry glanced over from the holographic output from the datapost it squeezed the handset keeping its glittering eyes on her more tertiary expression of interest your reference diplomatic exchange query which bureau she sighed safe in the knowledge that the translator would ignore it and replied bureau of procuration the parkry seemed to lose interest it gave her plastic bracelet studded with pattern of metallic dots and the datapost played recorded message in flat unaccented anglic this clothing is your identification while you are staying on millimillenary do not lose it sell it or exchange it for interdicted technology you will not be allowed to leave the planet without it it is resistant to all chemicals and temperatures above here the post made sound like poorlytuned radio and below sound like basspitched dog whine please note it is not resistant to thermonuclear fusion or comoncurensy isotope detonation above the thirty megaton range put it on now the parkry was watching her again so she wrapped it around her left wrist and pressed the ends together which melded to form single piece this clothing can only be removed by an authorised agent of the nosannoos on your departure from millimillenary the interview appeared to be over she stood up and wandered towards an exit where small groups of parkry were still queueing for departure processing she fished the videoeyepiece which she had not used since she last visited japan from pouch in her bag and put on the headband the eyepiece hanging over her left eye like pirates eyepatch it made tiny peep noise as it matched carriers with her notepad and the view through the eyepiece blurred momentarily one by one as the processor in her notepad identified and translated them various signs written in tertiary were marked and translations were appended in the eyepiece view she spotted datapost marked free information for the newcomer and went over to it she spoke to her notepad excuse me need information the datapost made pretty holographic moire patterns to indicate that it was thinking and then replied in anglic please be more specific need to locate food water and place to sleep also need to locate other humans on millimillenary if there are any another pause more moirepatterns and then food and water for humans can be obtained from the human embassy at lffre77153 no information regarding requirements for and it quoted her words playing sample of her saying place to sleep is available you will find other humans at the embassy it displayed map which looked like it might have been designed by piet mondrian her notepad translated the text and if she was any judge of distance the embassy appeared to be about seven hundred kilometres away from the export are there any places matching my requirements closer to the export if so please list the five closest and the distance to them another pause and then there are three maracite information exchange registry lffrb77151 six hundred and ninetythree blocks from here to there church of the subgenius llfrb77122 six hundred and fiftyone blocks from here to there another pause waddell emporium of extremely fashionable attire and quite nice ice cream parlour nrnal10021 two blocks from here to there these three were represented by tiny red inverted on the map two of them close to the embassy the icecream parlour so close to the export that it appeared almost to be on the same block she took snapshot of the map with her notepad expanded it until she could see enough details to find the icecream parlour and left the dome millimillenary appeared to be completely covered by cityscape the entire habitable surface of the planet divided up into grid with buildings that reached up for about fifty storeys providing third dimension that the map was nt required to show the streets were based in pale concrete paved with slippery white ceramic plates and would have been rather drab and utilitarian if it was nt for the hundreds of different xenoforms who streamed up and down them there appeared to be large single lane of foottraffic or at least what passed for feet on some beings moving in one direction and two smaller lanes on either side moving in the other direction this tended to work to the disadvantage of the sentients who were on the outside lanes and it became apparent that it was often easier to travel three or four blocks out of your way just to use the quicker inner lane in places she saw what appeared to be short grey trees bare of leaves the branches dividing into three from the base progressively subdividing to mass of threadlike tips she reached out to stroke branch which was about the thickness of her little finger and it writhed away from her touch waddell shop occupied the entire ground floor of one block the outside was mass of holographic signs in dozens of languages including anglic russic europan and katakana there were beeps squeaks and hums that she recognised as signs for xenoforms that did nt have visual sense she spent few minutes looking for door found one concealed within hologram of twometretall chocolate sundae her mouth was watering already and entered the icecream parlour was located in the centre of the store with the clothing displays surrounding it the clothes looked like theatrical costumes surely noone wore elizabethan ruffs these days she began to think that this store catered more for xenoforms who wanted to dress up than for actual humans she wondered why she had nt thought to ask the datapost at the export exactly how many humans there were on millimillenary at least the music was terrestrial early robert smith there was dejectedlooking young man with short dark hair sitting behind the counter he was cleaning small metal part from blender that was disassembled around him xeno that resembled metretall kiwibird hopped up on to the counter and said reeee reeeeeeee he took glazed cherry from bowl nearby and tossed it to the xeno which caught it with the end of its long flexible snout and jumped off she approached the counter and with an audible click turned off her notepad the young man froze excuse me like to order chocolate he looked up and almost fell off the stool he was perched on he leaped off the stool dropping the part he was cleaning rushed over and grabbed her shoulders he stared into her face with disturbing intensity are are you human he was trembling yes why you seem rather upset his eyes grew wide and look of hysterical disbelief appeared upset upset she says my god you are only the third human being that have seen in seven years upset he began to laugh hysterically she broke free from his grasp and grabbed him by the front of his shirt he kept laughing eyes squeezed shut and she was obliged to slap him he stopped abruptly gasping face almost white except for red palmprint staring at her in shock im sorry he whispered turning and stumbling back to the counter picking up the polishingrag as he went it was then that she noticed chain bolted around his ankle she rushed after him catching his arm and spinning him around to face her again he refused to meet her gaze so she took his chin in her hand and lifted his face he closed his eyes and tried to struggle free she threw her arm around his shoulder drew him close and pressed her lips to his after moment hesitation he responded returning her attention hungrily his hands slipped around her waist hugging her to him intently slowly forcing her back onto the counter she let him proceed wondering what sort of circumstance could put someone in position where he had to live apart from his own people for so long she got the story out of him eventually his name was marek and his greatgrandparents had started this venture out just over hundred years ago when the nrnal10021 district was still under development as the district became less local and more tourist oriented the business prospered to the point where they owned the entire block right up to the fiftieth floor at this point they had attracted the attention of subset of the parkry who demanded cut of the profits when marek grandparents had refused they had been denounced to the nosannoos as possible technocrats in the employ of the interdicted moridani and had been banished mareks parents too young to join his grandparents in exile had been indentured to local information trader who had taken over the business after assuring the parkry that they would get their cut which as rapidly learned was the way things were done around here still are in fact marek fell silent kelanie hugged him again what ca nt understand is they would put you into such menial mindnumbing labour as this when you would be more useful to them in an he glanced up at her administrative position he scowled kelanie this entire planet is kneedeep in bureaucrats could spend several lifetimes here gradually moving up the ranks and one day maybe maybe would get to position where could filch packet of blank memory cartridges maybe kelanie was silent marek had nt yet realised how high up in the structure her position was there was an awkward pause during which marek absently polished an alreadygleaming spoon kelanie stomach broke the silence with the sort of gurgle you get from not eating for three days she glanced longingly at the array of icecreamlike substances marek glanced at her apologetically and then rushed to prepare waddell special for her after sharing the large sundae with him she asked if there was somewhere she could sleep and marek pointed to pile of hessian like sacks in an alcove evidently his home the chain from his leg was fixed to point next to small washtrough from which water gurgled quietly there were few holograms pasted on the wall and small audio player she took him by the hand and led him over to his bed if that the way it looks then it probably is but would be tempted to take it apart anyway just to be sure aln riker from riker defense nosannoos interdiction trial records she woke few hours later with sore throat from the sharp oxygenrich air marek was hugging her as if he were afraid that she escape she idly stroked his cheek smiling it was nt often that she had the time or the inclination for such recreational activity in her position the intensity of the emotion marek had revealed after his isolation touched her deeply and she began turning various schemes around in her mind with view to releasing him from his servitude marek noticed the bracelet she had received at the millimillenary export what did you do to deserve that the parkry at the export gave it to me when arrived what do you mean deserve it marek stroked the pattern of raised metallic dots it looks like the markers that the nosannoos place on crates of interdicted technology think it an identifier for possible criminal activity sort of like warning it means that if you were arrested you be taken to the office of threat termination immediately no questions asked threat termination that sounds bit extr suddenly voice speaking in anglic called out from the main counter waiter wayyterr she was mildly surprised to recognise the voice it belonged to premillennium video actor rik mayall she turned over and peered at the counter she could nt see anything there but the voice called out again in exactly the same tones she suspected that it was being generated by digital sampler she got up draped some loose bedding material around her shoulders but after realising that there were very few xenoforms on millimillenary that would be offended by naked human she draped the cloth over marek instead and went over to the counter taking her notepad just in case waiter waiter was the alien complete anglic vocabulary looking over the counter she saw something like swollen turtle shell almost two metres long and metre tall she could see her reflection in the smooth glossy black surface the shell was completely featureless not even sign of feet wheels or other methods of propulsion it seemed to slide along the ground by sheer willpower she felt faint tickling sensation behind her breastbone as the xeno turned to face her probably caused by some sort of sonarbased sense the xeno spoke again employing another audio sample very old one judging from the degree of noise that accompanied it where our fish we ve finished our fish kelanie was paging through her notepad species id files which had been greatly augmented by access to the local data service this alien lacked name that could be easily represented in human terms and was simply denoted by the code nsvwtrea there was tertiary language interface available so she patched it in and spoke to it how may serve you the notepad converted her expression to tertiary and from there to nsvwtrea which sounded like wavery cockatoo screech which rose in volume and then faded again apparently the nsvwtrea natural communication took place on frequency higher than human hearing because the translator returned its response after short pause during which all kelanie heard was the faint jingling and crashing of the music had thought you incapable of sarcasm marek carriage return line feed have you been taking lessons behind my back carriage return line feed and from which of our worthy customers did you steal that instrument carriage return line feed believe that it is high on the nosannoos interdiction list if it is what it appears to be and if you continue to point it at me will have you beaten end of file what an asshole carriage return line feed kelanie thought marek rushed up pulling on pair of pants and threw himself down in front of the xeno kneeling arms thrust back forehead almost touching the floor acting on instinct kelanie started holographic recording sure that marek employer was about to give graphic example of how poorly it treated him the tickling feeling wavered as if the xeno was having trouble distinguishing between them it finally oriented towards marek edged closer to him and suddenly lashed out with clublike flipper hitting marek on the side of the head and almost knocking him down kelanie watched restraining herself the holographic recording clearly showed blood running from deep scratch on marek forehead the xeno turned to leave and kelanie nodded stopping the recording after finding particularly cutting insult in the nsvwtrea relationtable she stepped over and delivered solid kick to the rear end of the xenos shell pushing the alien across the floor into cluster of hatstands one of which fell over the xeno shuddered like stalled motorvehicle for moment and then seemed to regain its composure turning to face her like an armoured tank she felt the tickling feeling definitely as the blank curved turtle shape surged towards her marek grabbed her arm and whispered come on do nt make things any worse than they she held out her notepad and thumbed the send key it gave out short screech that stopped the nsvwtrea in its tracks there was moment of silence during which even the background music seemed to quieten kelanie felt the tickling feeling waver as the xeno hesitantly looked her over it hissed and her notepad translated confirm carriage return line feed she smiled grimly typed her response sent the translation it was so quiet that she could hear marek breathing behind her the xeno response must have been highly emotional as it was carried on soundwave that was well in the supersonic range the translator caught it though such transactions are not covered by nosannoos code carriage return line feed you must offer minimum amount to allow tax to be levied on the exchange end of file she popped dull metallic sphere out of plastic bubblepack she had been given at the earth export and tossed it to the floor in front of the xeno which scrambled after it and then turned to leave as it trundled away she felt the tickling feeling intensify almost to the point of an ache which suddenly cut off as the nsvwtrea passed through the exit marek he had vanished she followed the chain that had looped around one of the stools mounted behind the counter and led to the millimillenarian equivalent of broom cupboard marek was crouched inside with piece of recycled hessian papercloth pressed against the cut on his forehead his eyes squeezed shut marek you can come out now it safe he going to kill me he going to come back and kill me and cut me up and feed the pieces to his children he said that he do that one day if ever got out of line kelanie knelt down next to marek putting her arms around him he wo nt he ca nt because bought you from him in fact bought the whole enterprise marek opened his eyes and stared at her you could nt have doubt that anyone on earth has enough money to buy this property what did you say to him reminded him of subsection of the nosannoos code the part regarding proper treatment of equipment and subject races and told him that if the interspecies advisory group saw this recording id made that he and his entire species could be deported as possible risk of violent species classification then offered my word as human that erase the recording if he sold you to me and he could nt sell you unless he sold the shop as well marek face fell slightly so you re my owner now no not even your employer bureau associates are nt allowed to have anything to do with the private sector ll have to sign the entire thing over to you she smiled marek got up first thing we have to do is sell it my master my old master is probably off right now to find some mercenary pthalklin ervae that he can pay to torch the place that the way their minds work know few factors who be interested in this property he moved over to the telephone keyed the contact panel some words appeared in angular tertiary script which her eyepiece translated as finding free data channel please wait they waited marek tapping his fingers impatiently on the console more letters appeared on the screen while you approx are waiting concern approx is experienced by your government technological control bureau when rumorsunconfirmed reports approx appear indicating that the technological interdict is not being taken seriously approx remember only you approx can prevent thermonuclear devastation on wide scale kelanie was incredulous government propaganda they never stop do they wonder how the nosannoos bureaucracy has managed to stay together for this long thought that bureaucracy was one of the least inherently stable forms of government suddenly the telephone screen cleared and voice spoke in anglic human bureaucracy is inherently unstable nosannoos bureaucracy is not founded on greed and the inherently human sense of blind selfimportance this message was brought to you by the office of millimillenarian technological control marek smiled at this and when he caught kelanie giving him quizzical look he said they re always listening it just as well you did nt say anything really inflammatory otherwise the phone pinged and the call open message flashed up those ervae that my exmaster is hiring would find big hole in the ground here when they came to torch the shop anyway your call is always put through just after one of those little messages you just have to be careful that you do nt say something too inflammatory marek addressed the telephone in flawless tertiary and bizarre psychedelic pattern appeared on the screen oscillating and flashing through hundreds of glowing colours kelanie got the impression of two twisted toroids intertwined in midair marek asked keery nurwah marek keery whateveritwas chattered in hollowsounding oddlymodulated tertiary to which marek rapidly replied speaking over the translation that kelanie notepad supplied going too fast for it to keep up the thing pulsed bright green three times marek held up five fingers it pulsed bluegreen four times marek held up four fingers with his thumb bent over the thing flashed orange red and piercing hot pink colour and the image disappeared as it broke the connection marek stood there for few moments eyes wide faint smile on his face kelanie left off fiddling with the notepad playback and asked him keery kireedeonibalikathadamiax well did you sell it how much did you get for it when he did nt answer she nudged him and repeated the question oh yeah she bought it he went over to the counter and started rummaging around underneath looking for something she moved over to join him shifting boxes as he dragged them out from underneath the counter well come on marek do nt be tease how much marek found what he was looking for spherical yellowglass bottle filled with clear brown fluid popped the cap off took long swig and said four and one half cci he suddenly sat on the floor grimacing at the taste of the fluid cci comoncurensy isotope it the official medium of exchange on all the nosannoos civilised systems do nt you know anything well apparently the nosannoos do nt consider earth civilised yet that the first ve ever heard of what was it marek got up went over to the platformcash register mounted into the counter and retrieved note from the cash tray he held it out to her comoncurensy isotope it form of sheetcarbon tci in an tci total conversion isotope in an easytofuse format the nosannoos are generally energybased when it comes to currency earth is still trying to make informationbased currency work arent they she nodded examining the note we may be locked into the idea of an economy based on barter but at least we do nt use this sort of thing anymore she held out her wrist revealing the silver button contact of her workcredit hour meter marek took back the note replacing it in the till from force of habit this is the largest bill we have that five by ten to the power of minus twelve cci note he noted her expression and grinned yeah remember once that the entire human solar system all the planets and their resources was once priced at twenty cci kelanie tried to compare that to recent estimate of the solar system worth in human terms and gave up settling for the approximation that marek was probably richer than anyone she ever met before in fact richer than anyone on earth and you ve never seen one do nt think so no all have is the name tendeysharhi and the species id nfrfblag mind you have nt had really good look through the local data service yet find myself continually interrupted she smiled at him they were exploring the city looking for somewhere to stay while kelanie completed her mission this was the first time marek had been outside the shop since his indenture sixteen years ago and he was just as bewildered as she they had followed the grid pattern until they came up against huge blank curved wall which cut smoothly through the streets and buildings they had backtracked around the blocks coming up against this wall each time and had made no progress for about an hour when they decided to stop at something resembling street cafe and sort out their next move marek ordered iced tea the only terrestrial thing on the seff cafe menu while kelanie tried to sort out the indexing system used by the local data service this is strange it like binary tree but it has branches going both ways kelanie gave up looking for map that she could understand without requiring severe modifications to the structure of her brain and started tracing nfrfblag in the species id section she found it right next to nfrfknhk which was the code for humanity it was that catlike alien she had met onboard the nosannoos transport crash it she murmured that xeno could have been the one was supposed to meet something had come over to them and was trying to communicate tweaking its translator it had small rounded body perched on long stiltlike legs pair of small hands held up in front like kangaroo large domed head with four tiny red eyes set more or less evenly at the front wide lipless grinning mouth and no neck its translator said something some of which kelanies notepad could understand undefined undefined haircut undefined she grinned at marek xenoform barber do you think need haircut the alien bent at the knees bowing and smirking marek was earnestly trying to help the xenoform finetune its translator when kelanie spotted familiar feline form slinking into building across the street she grabbed marek arm excitedly dragging him away from the cafeteria and the domeheaded xeno she pressed up against the clear plastic of the officespace across the road from the cafeteria just as massive explosion rocked the street pieces of debris from the cafe clattering against the sheetplastic next to them there was brief space of silence followed by wierd cacophony of alien moans and hoots of distress the air was soon thick with the buzz and click of translators overlaid with tinkling belllike tones sirens that signalled the arrival of the bythian militia who were soon swarming over the site like insects from hive that had been attacked kelanie spotted the barber striding away on its improbably long legs tucking something into spherical satchel she dragged marek into the officespace glancing about for doorway out of the front deskscreening area that the feline xeno could have taken datapost was mounted into what passed for an enquiries desk kelanie approached it tugging marek who was still trying to see what was going on across the street with her where are we she asked the datapost which displayed the usual please wait while translate that moire and then said surprisingly in anglic kelanie aliiya camden you had an appointment with ambassador aouwwrrlrrinterfacetotheenemy this morning she is in at the moment if you would like to reschedule that appointment kelanie was surprised for moment and then said yes of course why was nt notified of the meeting the datapost chewed this over for few moments and said evidence points towards matter of pride between members of the tendeysharh embassy staff because you shared berth on nosannoos transport with ambassador aouwwrrlrr interfacetotheenemy mate impropriety was assumed kelanie frowned did nt touch it him whatever in fact deliberately slept outside the she was cut off by protracted yowl which was translated by the datapost and kelanie notepad simultaneously exactly was nt my mate good enough for you kelanie turned to see the feline xeno that she had spotted from the cafe she assuming it was she was similar in form to the tendeysharhi she shared the berth with on the nosannoos transport slightly shorter almost the same height as kelanie herself different markings much furrier tail and what appeared to be an elaborate gold necklace which on closer examination proved to be nosannoos exomanipulator second set of small mechanical hands which could be worn around the neck many races here wore them particularly those which had poor substitutes for hands without opposable thumbs was supposed to contact one of your staff with regard to detailed information about the correct approach to kelanie began and was cut off again by the tendeysharhi yes that is me while this gesture is largely symbolic it is nonetheless important that it be performed properly follow me the feline xeno glanced at marek that can wait outside kelanie glanced at marek smiled and said this is marek waddell onetime owner of she was cut off yet again tendeysharhi seemed to like doing that as mrrrlrr mate mewed flattening her ears her tail lashing back and forth have heard of you we put in bid for that property and were outpriced by keery her eyes narrowed to emerald slits and she growled can you think of any reason why should not attack you right now marek grinned and replied only that the property is nt worth anything like what keery paid for it the previous owner is going to have it burned to the ground if it has nt happened already he paused in thought kelanie was thinking along similar lines do you think the explosion in the cafe was an attempt on us by your nsvwtrea marek shook his head they only hire pthalklin ervae for that sort of thing they have one of those ninetyyear contracts for mercenary work if can use your data service for half an hour marek said to aouwwrrlrr think can bribe some parkry and learn something ambassador aouwwrrlrr lashed her tail in gesture of assent took kelanie by the hand and said meanwhile will instruct your mate in our customs she led kelanie to tendeysharhi conference room something like large tree turned insideout branches as thick as kelanie waist emerged from one wall crossed the room and entered the other the light in here was dim bluegreen from bioluminescent strips embedded in the domed ceiling aouwwrrlrr perched on branch about three metres from the ground with her chin resting on her paws and regarded kelanie with calm feline intent she mewed softly her expression tinged with soft purring trills and kelanie translator offered am student of primate psychology have been student of primate psychology for six years and yet must confess that can not understand humans kelanie sat on branch below aouwwrrlrr and replied feel free to ask me anything my position requires knowledge of ah primate psychology aouwwrrlrr tail flicked once and she said believe that you came here without being given much justification from your superiors correct yes do nt you feel need to question that do nt you want to know why you ve been sent here kelanie thought for moment climbed up to sit with her back against the bole of tree set into one wall then said no do nt most people who work for government agency well most people at my level are used to accepting unusual orders and not questioning them the world we work in even as we are occupied by the nosannoos and with most of the difficult decisions government usually faces taken from them is very complex and no one person could be expected to grasp more than facet of the whole thing aouwwrrlrr narrowed her eyes her translator said and yet someone in the nosannoos manages this task some single entity somewhere must know exactly what is going on kelanie suddenly began to have some doubts about this mission she recalled something robyn had once told her that in some conversations the topics were delineated more by what was avoided than what was discussed she recalled that the tendeysharhi had once been subject race of the moridani who were the dedicated enemy of the nosannoos she turned to frame very pointed question but was surprised by heavy thump as aouwwrrlrr leaped down to land next to her on the branch aouwwrrlrr held up her paw claws fully extended and said awkwardly in anglic race like tendeysharhi always listen to by sannoos careful when you say into translator of what you will say kelanie was silent for moment then said tell me how your mate would like to be approached for this occasion they settled down to business discussing the tendeysharhi sexual mores and customs kelanie resolved to investigate this matter further his highness dog at kew pray tell me sir whose dog are you alexander pope 1730 marek was busily applying skills he had picked up from childhood spent on world ruled by the innately bureaucratic parkry he was dealing favors the person at this end is waiting for an opening to appear so that the person can put forward proposal he said in tertiary the lowerlevel parkry official he had found to bribe manipulated data handset and the reply was spelled out on the screen the person at this end owes you no favors but would be interested in entering that state on the condition that any risk or innovation could be minimised marek smiled he had never met parkry that would nt take bribe if it could be assured that there was little chance of being caught the person at this end by way of introducing the proposal wishes it to be known that it is of human origin that it is proud of its human capabilities that humanity is seeking to better itself through becoming society that uses information as basis for exchange for currency the person at this end with typically subtle parkry perception perceives the topic of the proposal before it is described how can the person at this end enrich the human economy marek suddenly asked with uncharacteristic bluntness designed to shock the bureaucrat have the militia found the ones responsible for the attack on the seff cafe the parkry hunched its shoulders in surprise the person at this end is not cleared for matters relating to the militia but will attempt to locate person that is please wait marek smiled again hearing the parkry favourite expression things had certainly moved faster when he made it clear how much money he was willing to devote to the exercise the bureaucrat reappeared bobbing its head when it saw that marek was still attending the person at this end can reveal that the matter was taken out of the militia hands shortly after it happened the matter has been referred upwards upwards from the militia upwards the person at this end believes that this is very delicate matter the person at this end believes that it may have compromised its position in finding the information that has been made available it wanted more money marek went to deposit more cci in the famous bank account that was officially registered to marissey widely known as the temporary holding ground for parkry bribes but the bureaucrat at the other end ducked nervously squeezing the datahandset in haste the person at this end has not communicated effectively and will resort to human bluntness no more information is available this is wholly militia matter marek donated two by ten to the minus thirteenth cci in the account anyway after hearing this the incident originated with the militia most likely by an agent hired by the militia he asked is it possible to speak with militia official the parkry twitched its vestigal antennae the equivalent of sardonic chuckle the screen cleared and marek found himself face to face with plateau bythian wearing weapons and ammunition belts even though it was working in an office it regarded him from one side of its hatchetshaped head with obvious suspicion words appeared across the screen what do you want marek lied skillfully my lifetimecompanion was injured today in an explosion at cafe called seff we are concerned that such events occur in society as controlled as this one the bythian turned from the screen for moment marek could see part of shortwave terminal as the bythian searched database more words appeared the terrorist was apprehended an agent of the moridani of course we have visual window opened on the screen and picture appeared the barber do you wish to apply for government reparation benefit no thankyou the injury was minimal the bythian closed the connection without asking if marek wanted to know more marek had never merited the attention of the militia before not even his previous master had ever warranted interference at that level this had to be something to do with kelanie mission marek decided that it would prove too expensive to probe further also politically unsafe the parkry were bribeable the bythians were not once more you almost had it then said aouwwrrlrr kelanie composed herself put her head back and mewed aoouw aooouw aouwwrrlrr flattened her ears lashed her tail excellent this should be said before the act never during it is intended to indicate availability which means that once we start then no longer available aouwwrrlrr closed her eyes of course kelanie sat back on the branch dangling one leg over the edge swinging it back and forth exactly how far is this intended to go as far as consummation aouwwrrlrr mewed flicked her tail once in amused surprise if you want wo nt be jealous if that what you mean tendeysharhi are used to sharing around our males should caution you though detail of the male generative organs may complicate things how are human females structured kelanie removed her skirt aouwwrrlrr examined her prodding her cautiously with paw and then purred foresee no major problems except possibly that my mate may experience feelings of inadequacy marek was chatting with one of the underground networks napaisub simulators in itself very revealing that such borderlineillegal service should be available to datapost in what was allegedly government office ambassador prrtr aouwwrrlrr mate it sounds like she purring when she talks about him kelanie had said was dividing his attention between this and toying with replicatelizard which he intended to eat eventually marek faced the datapost addressing the napaisub simulator directly okay want you to observe this exchange and identify it understand the holograph animated two spheres knocking together twice to indicate an answer in the affirmative marek turned back to prrtr is that real lizard prrtr dangled the wriggling green shape from one paw flicked it with his other his translator replied of course not it geneticallyengineered plant with builtin reflexes that make it behave like lizard what do you think we are savages the datapost displayed black cube that broke apart into six pyramids and rejoined marek was about to ask the datapost to translate this when kelanie and aouwwrrlrr reentered the front office kelanie took prrtr paw in her hand and led him into the conference room marek watched them then glanced at aouwwrrlrr who flicked her tail once he smiled in the street order had been restored after the bombing of the cafe the only figures that were nt moving past were the two bythians that had been placed on sentry duty and the barber who was hiding behind the remains of truncated pillar listening to the conversation in the tendeysharhi embassy through the front window using an interferometric laserscope it reached into its pouch withdrew metallic ovoid and twisted dial at one end it grinned exposing rows of flat teeth tongue like rat tail flickered out and back in there was an earpiercing yowl and large furry shape pounced on it from somewhere above knocking it to the ground and kicking the grenade away the tendeysharhi grabbed the barber by some loose clothing at the front and slashed at the juncture of body and head with exposed claws four parallel furrows opened in the front of the barber spewing forth milkylooking blood it writhed tongue lashing about madly scrabbling for its pouch the tendeysharhi slashed at its neck again and shuddering the barber died one of the bythians turned its flat head to one side regarded them and turned away again napaisub subsystems of the nosannoos associative processing artificial intelligence napai each subsystem is individually identified by decimal sixfigure code built as part of project to downscale napai the original guidance ai of the nosannoos to more manageable system and to have subunits to which details of minor projects could be delegated originally only four of these units were constructed shortly after their inception rationale for more units was quickly invented and now there are as many napaisubs as there are worlds in the dominion in other words lots foley unofficial documents kelanie removed her clothing and sat in the matted grass that lined the conference room floor prrtr perched on the branch nearest the ground stared at her his head cocked to one side she smiled up at him remembering not to bare her teeth as she did so the tendeysharhi would take that as threat prrtr lashed his tail once she turned away from him resting on her hands and knees her bare behind pointing at him and mewed aoouw she was surprised to hear the rhythmic hissing of tendeysharhi laughter she turned around and gave him an indignant look what so funny prrtr was clutching the branch with his claws extended to keep from falling off few sibilant mews emerged kelanie notepad translated that sound you made it perfect but but what do nt you find me attractive more hisses suppose that you re quite attractive to another human but you you do nt have tail prrtr lost his grip on the branch and fell into pile of leaves at the base of the conferenceroom tree landing nimbly on all fours and then spoiling the illusion of agility by rolling over on his back hissing uncontrollably kelanie shifted into sitting position and stared at him chin on hands until he recovered prrtr lay on his back tail twitching from side to side arms and legs outspread sorry he said at length things have been so serious around here lately what with the moridani infiltration and all kelanie stared at him in shock beg your pardon are you certain that you should be saying things like that being the tendeysharhi ambassador to the nosannoos prrtr rolled over lay on his stomach resting his furry chin on his paws and levelling his cool emerald gaze at her oh it safe the nosannoos never monitor me the females of our race are the devious ones the ones that the nosannoos have to be concerned about us males are almost secondclass citizens that one thing the moridani promised us they change kelanie smiled does aouwwrrlrr know about this of course she suffragette you know in fact she was chosen by the moridani to approach the human government about permission to station moridani partisan in the human system kelanie listened to this with growing sense of unreality the moridani were universally dreaded it only took hint to the nosannoos that moridani might be on planet for them to blow that planet to pieces in frantic attempt to destroy it it was rumored that there were only twentythree moridani left in existence she became aware that prrtr was sitting next to her anxiously tapping her on the shoulder miss camden she shook her head sat back in the grass with her eyes closed ca nt believe any of this it too too too extraordinary prrtr rubbed up against her purring reassuringly the sound relaxed her after while he said it true there is moridani partisan hidden in our embassy she uses her own interdicted technology to hide from the nosannoos she believes that your race can be helpful to the moridani cause and so they want to station her in your solar system kelanie sat up suddenly ca nt authorise something like that if the nosannoos find out what going on they ll drop an asteroid in our sun prrtrs eyes opened wide seeming to change from brilliant emerald to aqua kelanie notepad reproduced the serious tone of prrtr words she has something important to tell you she did nt think youd believe me so she will tell you herself do you think that marek should be present the sense of unreality came back even stronger do actually really want someone to tell me that not dreaming unexpectedly prrtr butted his head against her shoulder purring you are nt dreaming marek and kelanie followed prrtr down spiral ramp deep into the basement of the tendeysharhi embassy at the bottom the bluegreen bioluminescent strips had been removed for the most part the air was damper and even more oxygenrich than millimillenarian standard kelanie swallowed as her throat burned prrtr approached blank wall turned to face the two humans aware that you marek have spent most of your life on millimillenary and are familiar with unusual xenoforms and that you kelanie work for the bureau of procuration and that you are no stranger to aliens want to remind you that the rumors of the moridani being bloodthirsty maniacal killers are completely untrue despite their appearance marek replied you can disregard anything you ve heard about humans taking nosannoos propaganda literally we know how to listen to what bureaucracy tells us prrtr slitted his eyes lashed his tail and turned back to face the blank wall it rippled and developed spiral pattern of grooves which spread out from the middle gradually erasing the wall until it had vanished completely beyond it was darkness kelanie translatoreyepiece viewing in the infrared range outlined massive shape at the far end of the darkened room she heard soft murmuring sound as if there were group of people holding private discussion in the darkness over this susurration soft voice spoke in perfectlyaccented terrestrial anglic come in please my name is tsiryfeylenkendrtariy kelanie stepped into the gloom with marek following nervously behind her the murmuring conversations were coming from the moridani who shifted slightly giving the impression of something with the mass of large horse the voices diminished in volume until only the occasional sibilant hiss or glottal click could be heard with peculiar scraping sound underlying them tsiryfeylenkendrtariy smoothly rose from her crouching position revealing her full height and moved over to wall an arm flexed out from her front touched contact and as the light levels slowly increased her form was revealed by degrees despite herself kelanie drew back slightly bumping into marek she tsiryfeylen was shaped something like sixlegged centaur pair of thin doublejointed arms mounted at the front slick grey flesh patterned in tiny scales that glittered in the faint light the attitude of the legs the placing of the hooves and ankles hinted at an ancestor with radial symmetry although she had head at one end and tail at the other kelanie stood there fascinated someone had once put forward theory that stated that intelligent life in the galaxy had so far been distinguished by three distinct waves of which humanity and related races were part of the third the moridani would have been part of the first wave tsiryfeylen was utterly unlike anything kelanie had seen thus far on millimillenary the vertical mouth that divided the triangular head mounted below pair of large diagonallyslitted eyes opened briefly revealing rows of long needlelike teeth suppressing the urge to turn and run kelanie realised that the moridani was smiling at her and that the scraping sound was the noise made by the teeth as they slid past one another pretty nasty eh tsiryfeylen said without using translator kelanie thought that she recognised the voice have we met before she enquired politely tsiryfeylen bared her fangs again bobbed her head she replied in different voice we re sure that we have she continued in her first voice dearest kelanie was certain now marek looked like he was about to panic and run so kelanie took his arm and murmured reassuringly it okay she on our side tsiryfeylen this is marek waddell former owner of waddell emporium of extremely fashionable attire and quite nice ice cream parlour tsiryfeylen splayed her front pair of feet slightly bowing marek one of these is one of these how many are there tsiryfeylen settled to the floor folding up neatly like cat and replied each moridani has four personalities each shared with four other moridani although as there are nt as many of us as there used to be this practice has declined miss camden is familiar with our tsiry aspect kelanie smiled as was about to say marek like you to meet robyn starkey section head of the bureau of procuration syndaine office my immediate superior what like to know is how do you get away with it teleconferencing has been popular for hundreds of years quite few government officials including humans hold two sometimes even three positions under assumed names when they have to put in an appearance they do so by video filtered through cosmetic graphics program we rarely have time for anything fancy imagewise because apart from our partisanship we hold two positions in the human government and one in the nosannoos bureaucracy kelanie looked around for something to sit on saw nothing appropriate and settled for sitting on the floor crosslegged marek sat next to her tsiryfeylen stared at them for few moments kelanie found that she had no idea of what moridani kinesics meant she would have to rely on what she could pick up from tsiryfeylen voice we re afraid that we have some bad news for you the nosannoos have completed their initial evaluation of humanity study that began almost ninety years ago our position in the nosannoos bureaucracy has allowed us to steal copy of the preliminary recommendation which is in about month time the nosannoos are going to drop about dozen large asteroids on earth followed by another thirty that will be dropped into your sun at regular intervals this will coincide with the arrest and subsequent termination of all free humans anywhere in the nosannoos dominion we must say we re impressed we have nt seen reaction this extreme since they discovered that there were few of us moridani still on the loose there was moments silence while they digested this finally marek said do you expect us to believe that tsiryfeylen held out her hands and shrugged very human gesture the choice is yours you have twentyseven days kelanie grasped marek hand cleared her throat and said do you have any proof something tangible tsiryfeylen drew small card made of clouded white plastic handed it to kelanie nothing that ca nt be easily faked the best way we can think to convince you is to show you the activity in your asteroid belt where the militia are even as we speak preparing the projectiles that will be tsiryfeylen paused seeing kelanie and marek absorbed in reading the documentation kelanie had placed the card against her notepad scanner which read it and translated the nosannoos tertiary into anglic the message was short office of risk evaluation date 9327685491767632151 interdepartmental action code af1cf3c7f8c65e98a06ed63c87e542c authorisation 1110011001010001001001001001001001011110101001 note to all departments preliminary evaluation of nfrfknhk indicates threat potential of 978 percent this is based on evidence of innate territorial habits and research into artificial intelligence which is currently in progress preliminary recommendation level six termination to commence immediately pending availability of resources any further enquiries can be directed to the office of threat termination on sthelanar work group t760 cost code 568384 you can ignore the last part the office of threat termination report all such enquiries to the militia as matter of course tsiryfeylen said marek and kelanie exchanged glances you think that barberxeno was after us she murmured it would make sense round up the strays marek faced the moridani okay if this is all true then what the hell can we do about it tsiryfeylen mouth twitched exposing few glittering teeth for moment you could warn everyone which would cause panic you could do nothing which would mean that your planet would be destroyed with most of the inhabitants still on it you could try mounting an attack on the bythians in your asteroid belt which could prove difficult given your lack of spacecraft and weapons and would most likely fail as most attacks on bythians do or you help with what is being done get as many important people off earth as possible and hide them kelanie was indignant at this important who gets to decide who is important and who is nt tsiryfeylen head swivelled to face her eyes narrowed we do we are financing this operation we are hiding your people in our bases and are assuming the responsibility for making sure that they remain hidden we are saving any humans who can assist us in our war against the nosannoos we do not have the resources to hide everyone we have been working on this since before you were born miss camden we can only progress when we are entirely sure that there is no risk of discovery kelanie felt numbing chill settle over her as the scope of tsiryfeylens revelation sank in we have been hiding from the nosannoos for over seven thousand years we have never exposed ourselves to the possibility of discovery to the degree that we are doing at the moment the only reason we are doing this we believe that humanity can one day help us now this is what we are going to do next the closest bythian has ever come to creating work of art or evincing sense of humour was when the level three subcommander in charge of the assault force on the moridaniheld world of triples ordered bombpattern that spelled out the words up yours ugly in moridani phandric foley unofficial documents three large featureless whitemetal shapes made their way down the crowded street the crowds parted before them breaking on the larger of the three like water on the prow of an icebreaker flowed past the two that followed the rift quickly healing close behind the first shape was about the size of an elephant it had four strong stumpy legs at the narrow base of an inverted trapezoid shape two doublejointed mechanical arms were neatly folded at the front this shape moved deftly occasionally whirling around to check that the other two were following utilising an involved sequence of steps turning back when it was sure that they were still in tow they were smaller and obviously of different species bilaterally symmetrical two arms and legs where the first shape was almost three metres from the ground to the forepeak the others were squat shapes just under two metres tall one of them seemed to be unsure of the correct method of walking it stopped with one foot in the air every few steps crash it what wrong with the damn thing now kelanie snarled you re fighting it kelanie try dropping forcefeedback few notches or turn it off altogether you may get tired but it wo nt matter in the short term kelanie sighed hunted for the forcefeedback control mounted somewhere on the inner face of her landmate battle suit and replied can understand why you need suit like this tsiryfeylen but why the hell do we the bythians are probably looking for you by now we stand better chance of getting away with this if they think we are someone else you do nt mean that we will have to wear these suits until we get back to earth kelanie wailed she had only just become used to the newvinyl smell of the inside of the landmate the spread of the legspaces was rubbing painfully on the insides of her thighs and she halfexpected to be bowlegged when she finally divested herself of the thing once inside the ship and safely away you can take them off we however that is wemyself wo nt risk exposure until we have safely reached the moridani base in the asteroids assuming that the threat termination team have nt lobbed it into the sun anyway we are quite comfortable in this suit wemyself have spent weeks at stretch in it weyourself are probably couple of cans short of sixpack kelanie muttered tsiryfeylen laughed by your standards we probably are uhoh quiet children they were passing four bythians who were checking id bracelets tsiryfeylen had been able to remove kelanie bracelet providing similar one which now hung on the outside of kelanie suit the bythians grabbed one arm of tsiryfeylen armour carelessly dragging it closer to read the pattern of dots on the tag that hung on the leading edge of her suit they assumed marginally more respectful attitude after they had read it tsiryfeylen was posing as an important government official she snatched her arm from the bythian grasp made an involved gesture with it and the four militia stepped aside they proceeded kelanie angled one of her shoulderboommounted cameras backwards and watched them the bythians were ignoring them will these disguises get us past the export authority she asked we were hoping that you would nt ask that tsiryfeylen sighed we think so we have used this disguise before and have never encountered any problems mind you we did nt have two pesky humans in tow then we are prepared to fight if necessary although small arms combat with bythians is something we rather watch on video than participate in kelanie suit paused one foot in the air lagging behind marek and tsiryfeylen for moment then catching up again damn it do you think we ll be in shootout feel like sitting duck in this thing does it have any weapons tsiry made reproaching tsktsk sound you re supposed to be bureau of procuration operative not some gunnut weapons system expert your suit does nt have any energy weapons but if you turned the forcefeedback up all the way you could easily put your fist through the side of nosannoos transport that also applies to the legmovements with the force feedback on full you could leap up to thirdstorey balcony or jump off the roof and land safely so be careful the thought of being that strong appealed to kelanie when they stopped at an intersection to let line of what appeared to be parkry children pass by she started experimenting with the controls first she played with the responsetime finetuning and found that this was the cause of her suit lagging behind on some steps and anticipating others when it was tuned properly she could almost feel it slip into place she flexed the fingers in front of the shoulderboommounted cameras bent the knees it suddenly felt like second skin feeling of energetic euphoria that she only experienced previously when absorbed in complex gymnastic routine inside the suit she grinned turned the forcefeedback control to the x4 position and tapped her toes the suit responded jumping three feet off the ground landing on the flat splaytoed feet the knees bending automatically to absorb the shock yahooo she shouted turning the control to the x8 position and leaping eight metres into the air performing somersault and landing on the other side of the street in gap barely big enough to accommodate the suit kelanie tsiryfeylen froze her suit by remote control if you want to draw attention to yourself you can take all your clothes off and run down the street try to keep our situation in mind please tsiryfeylen poked cameraboom around the corner scanned the broad courtyard outside the export two more booms mounted on kelanie and marek suits respectively appeared just underneath tsiryfeylen there were at least thirty bythians arranged around the courtyard and even to kelanie untrained perception they were nt merely on guard someone had anticipated them wait here children we ve arranged reception for our fascist friends some pthalklin ervae when we give the signal we want you to run straight into the ship even as tsiryfeylen spoke kelanie saw movement in the decorative shrubbery arranged around the triangular doorways of the geodesic dome then she realised that the movement was nt caused by someone hiding in the bushes the movement was the bushes six plants shaped like large agapanths central shaft topped by what appeared to be large red pineapple moving on round platforms that hovered few centimetres off the ground emerged from the less ambulatory shrubs sharp compressed air sounds came from within their broadlyspread leaves half the bythians fell to the ground with large holes blown through them thin yellow blood sprayed about the remaining bythians immediately returned the fire microwave weapons causing three of the plants to burst into flame there was massive explosion in the corner nearest the moridani and the humans flat pieces of concrete chipped off the courtyard corner wall clattered off their armour when tsiryfeylen dared to put boomcamera around the corner again she saw two of the plants nudging the bodies of the bythians into heap she gestured to kelanie and marek and dodged nimbly around the corner they ran after her pausing only briefly when she stopped to confer with the two surviving pthalklin ervae inside the export building everything had stopped at the sound of the explosion parkry seated next to their dataposts regarded them blankly kelanie went to leap over the short barrier that laterally divided the room in two she seemed to strike an invisible flexible barrier and fell on her behind with crash what the linenoise was that marek stumped over to help her up reached out and twanged set of invisible wires strung over the barrier monofilament lucky we re wearing these suits or we be on the other side in thin slices he walked over to the gap in the barrier and kicked out the door it flew across the room and embedded itself in the far wall end first with short metallic screech the parkry hopped back nervously as the two passed through the gap and ran up the ramp into the ship they turned left at the first corridor inside the ship and found themselves facetoface with bythian who was raising his weapon without thinking kelanie lashed out with one of the suit arms backhanding the bythian flat against the wall with terrible force killing it instantly she crouched to pick up the plastic gun examined it it looked something like an automatic rifle with long rectangular magazine jammed in the base there was nothing that obviously resembled trigger she shrugged within the suit and bashed the gun against the starship wall snapping the barrel she angled the two shouldermounted booms forward extended them to their full reach of two metres and tiptoed up the corridor peeking up the side corridors as they progressed as they approached the end of the corridor they heard the hum of bythian microwave weapon coming from the righthand branch of the intersection immediately afterwards grey shape flew through the air past them and down the lefthand branch of the intersection large white shape ran after the grey shape they barely had time to recognise tsiryfeylen in her battlesuit they ran to the intersection and saw tsiryfeylen holding bythian by its legs batting its head against the wall with measured ferocity when the bythian came apart she dropped the pieces she was holding stamped on the head with both of the battlesuit front legs abruptly span through one hundred and eighty degrees and punched out wall panel with both hands she reached in extracted the dented panel and tossed it over their heads kelanie heard soft squelching sound and turned boom mounted camera back to see bythian crushed against the further end of the corridor behind the wall panel while tsiryfeylen was working on the machinery behind the panel tearing cables out and poking fingers into controlspaces another bythian appeared down the corridor at the ship hatch it levelled its weapon at something outside that something slashed at the bythian neck severing the axeshaped head and knocking its weapon aside one of the pthalklin ervae hovered up the ramp and through the hatch the entire ship shuddered rocked the suits internal gyros keeping balance tsiryfeylen darted between them off down another corridor they ran after her the ship had lifted with its hatches still open the air thinned vanishing completely when they had reached low orbit except for the room in which they had secured the pthalklin ervae tsiry feylen had been rushing from one end of the ship to the other checking the most likely hiding places if there are any more bythians they should be dead by now the ship had landed only four hours ago so there should nt have been anyone else on board when we ve reached our allocated departure point wemyself will have finished searching the entire ship we can close the hatches and refill the ship air supply from the stores kelanie suit gestured to marek come on want to see millimillenary from space they stamped off down the halflit corridor while tsiryfeylen stalked through the ship kicking servicehatches open thrusting her camerabooms rapidly in and out of the circular doors of the berths finding nothing there were no more bythians on board kelanie and marek were leaning out of hatch in the underside of the ship into open space below them the golden surface of millimillenary was spread out the faint grey gridwork of the city visible even from this altitude their suit radios beeped and tsiryfeylen said heads up children we re about to close the hatches they pulled back into the corridor as the blackglass hatchway rippled into existence almost immediately their suits lost some of the stiffness that came with vacuum they made their way back to what tsiryfeylen thought was the pilot wardroom and when the air pressure was adequate they gratefully divested themselves of the battlesuits ohhh praise bob that relief said marek stretching tsiryfeylen made no move to take off her suit kelanie reached for her toes straightened arched her back and wondered how tsiryfeylen could stand to be confined in her suit for such long periods the moridani spoke through an audio port mounted on the side of her suit we re halfway home children although you should both know that the most dangerous part is still ahead of us we like you to set up recorder on the ship communications column to monitor the trade channels then go and make sure the pthalklin ervae is safe we ve prepared brief knowledgebase for you describing most of the dangerous features of this ship familiarise yourselves with it she handed them white plastic card meanwhile we are going to spy on the enemy kelanie and marek sat crosslegged on top of shipping container in the cargo bay where the pthalklin ervae whose name apparently was kayrenkayley had broken open about dozen plastic bags filled with soil and was spreading it evenly across the floor on closer examination the ervae was not really an intelligent plant but rather living hive host to thousands of tiny insects acting in communion with the plant communicating via chemical tags individually the insects were very simple each acted out complex geneticallyprogrammed motions forming the basis of an intricate objectoriented intelligence program conversations conducted between kelanie notepad and the plant spectrographic interpreter were hampered by the plant slow reactiontimes no do nt see it as handicap marek said but if your species has such slow reflexes then how can you effectively support yourselves as mercenaries kelanie notepad converted his words into nosannoos tertiary and transmitted them to the pthalklin ervae interpreter which rendered them as pattern of pheromones spraying at the insects that teemed in the diagonal interstices of the pineappleshaped top an airborne caste of the insects replied dancing and spreading pheromones against the interpreter reading plate which then spoke to kelanie notepad in tertiary the nexttosmallest components of us are the equivalent of your computers it said once instructed they can operate with great speed we have several sets of components that know how to react to situations and we cycle through these sets modifying them as necessary the largest delays occur when we have to communicate with animals who do nt have the requisite senseorgans to read our chemical expressions directly kelanie sighed typical kayrenkayley slowly crawled off her platform wriggling her knobbed roots into the soil connecting to port 71 of

concurrence concurrence napaisub 200211 has left the conference gulp crikey muttered tsiryfeylen after the ships first shift from physicalspace to probablespace and back kelanie and marek had found some thick padded mats in hold of the ship and were lying on them in the wardroom after an unsuccessful attempt at making love on the curved floor of the berths if we re going to put together bed it might as well be in the wardroom kelanie said marek hesitated despite being brought up on millimillenary he was not comfortable with the idea of appearing naked before xenoforms even tsiryfeylen but only for moment the ship communication channels hissed faintly the sound broken by the occasional beep to indicate that the ship had passed out of the effective range of one gravitic beacon and into another twice voice on the channels had spoken in nosannoos tertiary marek translated they re asking us if we need assistance they ve assumed that the bythians killed us meaning that they ca nt accept the possibility that we killed the bythians marek nodded they re more hidebound than thought how they ve kept hold of control for this long is mystery to me tsiryfeylen entered still wearing her battle suit docilely followed by kayren she replied to kelanie musings it because the situation is being handled locally so far as soon as it is referred up to parkry that does nt mind admitting that it has no idea of what to do next then it will become matter for the millimillenarian napaisub and the bythians that when we may be in trouble tsiryfeylen stalked over to the control board poked fingers into group of controlspaces deactivating video screens muting the hissing of the communication channels she continued we have to announce slight change of plans children kelanie retorted would you please stop calling us that still working at the ranked banks of control columns tsiryfeylen waved the camerabooms of her suit in manner reminiscent of the pattern used by the insectoid kaelen to indicate amusement if you wish as we were saying we will stop over at the asteroid base to visit my sister before we make for earth the situation has changed slightly marek left off kissing kelanie neck to ask when will you tell us exactly what going on what we will do when we reach earth tsiryfeylen sat her suit down the legs folding up underneath like cat if we told you everything if we gave you the statistics that govern our movements against the nosannoos you would both probably walk out of the airlock without your suits be content with knowing that you will both most likely be able to live out your allotted lifetimes which is more than can be said for the rest of humanity kelanie lay back on the pile of matting staring at the ceiling of the wardroom and said ve been meaning to ask you about that robyn in her suit tsiryfeylen smiled baring her needle teeth if we are stopping over on earth how much of risk would it be to let few of our most trusted friends know what going to happen and invite them onboard there room on this ship for at least hundred people abruptly tsiryfeylen suit cracked down the middle and opened like the two halves of hotdog bun she stepped out blinking in the watery yellow sodium light and shook her legs in pairs we have no objection to that if you would like to prepare some text mail messages we ca nt risk video because even humans can tap into that we will send them through secure channel after making sure that the nosannoos monitors in the mail network ca nt pick up on what we are doing by reading them kelanie was surprised do you mean to say that the nosannoos manage to read all the mail tsiryfeylen grinned exposing frightening array of dental work that why they have machine monitoring it if it was nt for the organisational skills of the nosannoos artificial intelligence and the diligence of its subunits the dominion would have collapsed long ago how many people can we rescue tsiryfeylen spread her six fingered hands in gesture of apology limit it to six or less we have already allocated the rest of the space for cargo there is lot of equipment that we have to get off earth before threat termination blow it marek glanced at kelanie and then said slowly that is nt going to happen for six months though is nt it tsiryfeylen spun about nimbly on her six legs gestured to the pthalklin ervae and left without answering followed by kayren marek and kelanie glanced worriedly at each other some twenty hours later when kelanie and marek had decided to give the spherical sleepingberths second chance tsiryfeylen raced past in her battlearmour shouting to them suit up we have company they disentangled themselves and scrambled for the suits that were kneeling opened like clam shells in corner of the wardroom over the suit radios tsiryfeylen brought them up to date the ship reentered physicalspace just inside the asteroid belt as expected what we did nt count on was the entire belt being thick with bythian scouts we understand that they are still preparing the assault on earth there scout approaching crew of four informing us that it is about to dock we have nt responded yet come down to the lower fore airlock when they got there tsiryfeylen was replacing panel on the side of the hatch hammering the lockbolts home with her flattened palm we re going to have to lure them out and then blow the hatch we hope the decompression will kill them all we want you both to back up this corridor just there around that corner if one of them gets past kick the stuffing out of it tsiryfeylen suit crouched down directly in front of the hatch clutching handful of sharp metal fragments there was minute silence and then the plastic of the hatchway creaked under an unfamiliar stress kelanie braced against data column in the passageway poked the tip of boommounted camera around the corner patching the image through to marek suit the black glass door of the hatch rippled away and two bythians leapt through weapons drawn they did nt recognise tsiryfeylen crouching tankshape for moment third bythian had stepped through the hatch when the first two whipped up their guns too late tsiryfeylen flicked the fragments at them with as much strength as her suit could impart they punched through the bythians heads and necks embedding themselves in the wall behind them as the bodies collapsed she set off the explosives that she packed into the hatchway there was sharp crack and shockwave pushed tsiryfeylen suit back against the wall where she grabbed hold of stanchion the shockwave suddenly reversed as air rushed out the hatch crackling and buzzing as it tried to cover over the enlarged hole the scream of escaping air quickly diminished to hiss and then stopped as the hatchfield closed tsiryfeylen was checking an external camera on her suit monitors she relayed the images to kelanie and marek who watched as the torn globe of the bythian scout ship spun off into the distance the tiny figure of the fourth bythian wriggling in open vacuum gradually becoming still among the debris that drifted around in the trailing lagrange point of mars was rock about two metres along its longest axis indistinguishable from the other orbital rubbish it hung there apparently inert until it decided to distinguish itself from its more sedentary companions by suddenly rotating forty degrees aiming itself at spot somewhere in the outer fringe of the solar system another rock in the leading lagrange point did the same they were now both pointing to spot about twelve million miles above the plane of the ecliptic inside each rock masssensors triangulated fixing the position of one of the nosannoos projectiles satisfied that the asteroid was where it was supposed to be although not where they would prefer it the small but capable artificial intelligences in the spysatellites oriented on another asteroid and another when they were satisfied that they had correctly placed all the known threats they did general halfhearted scan for any other sizable objects that were nt where they should be surprisingly they found one an asteroid of some two thousand and seventy tonnes that according to their very accurate and uptodate database should be at least two million miles further out then they spotted another then four more approaching state that could best be described as alarm the two spysatellites sent coded signal on the gravitic channel that was until recently used by the nosannoos as the main data link for earthbound communications use of this frequency would arouse the least amount of suspicion if the bythians were listening in the spysatellites knew that the intended recipient of the message would always be listening suddenly faster than even electronic reflexes could allow for the spherical shape of bythian scout shot past loosing stream of stone chips at high velocity battering the spysatellite into inactivity how many asteroids are there in the asteroid belt marek asked do nt know kelanie replied absently scanning the starfield hundreds of thousands suppose what like to know is where are they all we ve seen your illustrations of the asteroid belt tsiryfeylen commented and we can assure you that the ratio of rocks to empty space is several magnitudes smaller than they would have us believe like physical reality it mostly vacuum she stood at the control column twitching fingers thrust into the controlspaces slowly rotating the ship looking for particular pattern of stars she aligned single glittering spot on the screen in front of her rotated the ship on its forward axis and drove it forward while one hand monitored the ship velocity the other activated the communications system embedded inside the front of her battle suit which was propped open next to the control column two of her voices chattered rapidly and were answered by two others from the comms system kelanie notepad could make nothing of it the exchanges were too rapid switching back and forth with inhuman speed the spot on the screen that represented their destination hadnt changed size appreciably tsiryfeylen left off chattering for moment stuck all her fingers into bank of controlspaces and said hang on children marek grabbed kelanie who having nothing better to do wrapped her arms around him the ship lurched forward spilling them backwards over the pile of mats they had enough time to struggle to their knees when the ship moved in different direction shifting from underneath them kayren mounted in corner as unobtrusively as an office potplant merely swayed slightly tsiryfeylen who had remained upright through all this gestured towards the screen here we are the screen was filled with rocktextured grey sharp black highlights slowly shifting as the asteroid rotated tsiryfeylen made few delicate adjustments to the ship attitude matching spin and then nudged it forward suddenly off to the left the featureless asteroid face split open along seven radial lines the triangular segments folding back like flower petals the nowfamiliar white shape of moridani battlesuit emerged legs kicking holding struggling something in its arms the moridani kicked the shape bythian in torn pressure suit away the reaction of which pushed the battlesuit back towards the hatch the arms extended as far as possible scrabbling against the hatchway petals the chattering sound came from tsiryfeylen suit resumed briefly tsiryfeylen sighed and said it seems that threat termination have decided to use this asteroid after all kendrsaranaxioparndtaathanasius our dear sister has dealt with the scouts but threat termination will soon wonder why this asteroid is nt moving we re going to try and bluff them open channel threat termination here why is nt projectile 607 moving team it had humans in it nine of them they were armed can you tell if the structure was humanbuilt any signs of xenotechnology report their living quarters were damaged beyond recovery what we saw looked humanbuilt we had to set off one of the cci charges at close range they got two of us sigh this just goes to confirm napaisub evaluation estimate new impact time assuming that you can get it to impact we can we have three charges left once we get the projectile up to 195 kmsec path is 285 by ten to the sixth kilometres give us ah 40 hours 35 minutes 45 seconds from now marked this is the last one team once you have confirmed trajectory tag it and assign it to tracking close channel that slack for bythians that is slack kendrsaranaxio was slightly smaller version of her sister moving with sharp efficient grace she shut down the videosimulator which she had played like puppetmaster transmitting convincing portrayal of bythian scout mimicking its phrases we do nt think that they believe us tsiryfeylen spoke to her in rapidfire bursts of moridani kendrsaranaxio replied with single word which sounded something like fsyen both moridani bared their teeth in what kelanie assumed were smiles kendrsaranaxio summoned her battlesuit which walked into the docking bay of its own accord opening as it entered stay here children we are going to set off some fireworks comoncurensy isotope is another one of those annoying offshoots of their plastics industry according to my sources on syndaine the nosannoos manufacture it in foundries that orbit very close to certain suns solar power is somehow stored in sort of semistable carbon lattice yes that is rather vague this is because cci monopoly on efficient powerconversion technology is one of the three things that keep the nosannoos in control there no percentage in giving that sort of information away aln riker from riker defense nosanoos interdiction trial records kelanie marek and kayren were huddled together in corner of room adjacent to the docking bay of the moridani base the humans were in their suits again they were all listening to kendr saranaxio counting down to the detonation of the bythian scout cci charges that had been set three kilometres from the asteroid marek and kelanie were discussing the ease with which they had overcome the bythians so far once saw ninehour epic video that relates to this kelanie said it was about world that was so inhospitable that the inhabitants became natural warriors they spread throughout the galaxy but once they conquered everyone in sight they deteriorated because they lacked real opposition marek agreed the bythians on millimillenary were pretty soft bunch youd hear reports of how team of six bythians had taken on an entire planet of dissidents and wiped them out completely yet there were always messages on subversivenet about how bythians kept blowing their feet off because they did nt know how to operate their weapons properly soft pinging tone indicated that kayren had something to say they waited politely for the translation the bythian reputation is wellfounded during the second expansion they were ferocious efficient and almost without regard for their safety it was common technique for bythian to steer scoutship loaded with cci charges into the middle of group of enemy shuttles and set off the charges we partly attribute their decline to lack of suitable opposition and partly to their maturity as species when they were created and this was told to me by bythian just before killed it they felt that they had no racial identity and thus had less to live for kelanie asked just how powerful are these cci charge things tsiryfeylen said over the radio brace yourselves children you re about to find out there were three distant thumping sounds echoes of the shock waves transmitted through the thin layer of gases that were result of the detonation of the cci charges there was pause during which marek said well that was nt so and then the entire base shifted as if god had kicked it there was crash as some unsecured containers fell over the entire base creaked as if it were being twisted kelanie felt ghostly acceleration inside the base was under power moving she unclamped her suit from marek stood up and tried to open the door to the docking bay it was locked she raised boommounted camera to the small round window mounted in the centre of the door peered through she could see corner of the open gate through which tsiryfeylen had steered the nosannoos ship part of starfield that was rolling in dizzying fashion tsiryfeylen spoke okay children we re on our way we will be in earth orbit within forty hours unless we get stopped for exceeding the speed limit kelanie could you meet us in the garage please map of the moridani base appeared on kelanie headsup display with blue arrow marking the location of the garage we have been giving some thought as to your future as partisan tsiryfeylen and kendrsaranaxio were sitting on rugs woven with intricate patterns in shades of grey legs folded underneath kelanie was sitting inside the opened shell of her battlearmour eyes closed still do nt believe any of this suppose that it failing of mine just ca nt encompass the idea of genocide human genocide in particular tsiryfeylen sent some text to kelanies headsup display she grabbed the eyepiece read it replies to her mailmessages from her friends kel we ll try and be there everything has gone crazy in the past week the nosannoos have withdrawn completely the news services have been canceled there is nt any fast transport available we ll be hitching ride with baralascopae remember him the ultralight enthusiast if we can find him there are all kinds of wild rumors flying around like the machinevirus one the most persistent is the one about giant asteroid that about to hit the earth we ca nt check this out because all the satellite observatories are owned by the nosannoos or were what going on fondly but nervously all the same gaeren gen and mileva kelanie closed her eyes again kendrsaranaxio said there are two ways you can take this you can sit back and let it happen pretend that there nothing you can do about it kelanie snorted cynically or you can fight back is that going to save anyone it too late for that we have seen this happen to six other civilisations each time we managed to save some of them only to watch them submit to apathy we had hoped that humanity would be different kelanie sat up in her battlesuit do nt think you understand not warrior do nt know anything about weapons prostitute you pointing at tsiryfeylen pretending to be robyn you assigned me to millimillenary why me why not weapons specialist why not someone who could do better job of attacking the nosannoos human weapons specialists no longer exist the nosannoos proscribed human weapons research in our limited capability with the bureau of procuration we checked everyone that we could for the qualities that we need you came out on top kelanie sneered falling back into the suit oh sure that the ability to deliver good blowjob is essential to partisanship tsiryfeylen bared her teeth the qualities we are looking for include adaptability quick reflexes and willingness to believe that the impossible can at least be attempted she got up padded over to the side of kelanie suit we once found human weapon specialist he was one of the first people to travel offworld when the nosannoos arrived he had definite ideas about what could be done and what could nt and he had no inclination to change those ideas or broaden his horizons what happened to him he joined group of pthalklin ervae on copperla and bythian killed him the point is while he knew great deal about military matters his knowledge got in the way he could nt conceive of battles fought with asteroids for example and he refused to even consider the one thing that the nosannoos fear above all kelanie opened her eyes which is tsiryfeylen held up the videoeyepiece which had been connected to kelanie notepad biological augmentation manmachine interfaces do you recall the first thing that the nosannoos did when they arrived after taking over and disassembling our nuclear capability they laid down guidelines for acceptable research warning us that if we stepped outside those guidelines they would be reinforced with show of military strength and at the top of the list of prohibited technology artificial intelligence genetic engineering virtual reality biological modification and the nosannoos believe that humans even unmodified are such threat that you have to be wiped out completely can you see that they fear you almost as much as they fear us that you have the potential to undermine them kendrsaranaxio added something in moridani which inspired brief argument between the two xenoforms kelanie sighed closed her suit and turned off the cameras kelanie was in the control room of the nosannoos freighter that they hijacked examining the mass of controlspaces that made up the communications panel she had read everything that tsiryfeylen knowledgebase had to say on the operation of nosannoos equipment and she thought that she could operate the comms system without tsiryfeylen finding out she looked over her notes again rehearsed the patterns and then tentatively poked her fingers into four holes one after the other nothing obvious happened she poked finger and thumb into the nosannoos equivalent of the enter key and the main monitor came to life hissing with vertical streaks of video static there were six particular controlspaces underneath the monitor that were concerned with adjusting the frequency of the receiver she played with these for few minutes before discovering that they only altered the frequency over several preset channels none of which were used by the earth contingent of the nosannoos she looked at her notes again found reference to global frequency unlock activated it now apparently the six controlspaces underneath the monitor would range up and down the nanogravitic band the two outside holes changing the frequency rapidly the innermost holes finetuning it she was so absorbed in this that she did nt notice kayren glide up behind her the pthalklin ervae watched over her shoulder as she searched through the available frequencies for any signal from earth she found few channels saturated with red and green vertical stripes which she recognised as encoded bythian military transmissions finally towards the upper end of the frequencies that the freighter could receive she found band without noise which meant that signal was being transmitted on that frequency synthesised voice was counting down in tertiary from somewhere around sixtyone thousand speaking every two minutes or so few rapid calculations revealed that if this was countdown to the asteroids impact on earth they had thirtyfour hours left she jumped nervously as kayren pushed past her moving closer to the control panel like this kelanie kayren translator said three insects each about the size of kelanie thumb floated up to the columns darting in and out of the controlspaces occasionally flying back to the leafplatforms that were arranged in fringe just below kayrens pineappleshaped head to pick up new pheromonal instructions then flying up to execute them the hissing of the untuned videoscreen cleared revealing twodimensional display red tertiary text against black background kelanie lifted her videoeyepatch watched as the words blurred and resolved into the anglic translation this is nosannoos announcement the service you are calling has been discontinued due to breach of the interdiction laws that is the primary data exchange channel from earth kayren explained it was kelanie was in her battlesuit drifting alongside the nosannoos freighter bolted to the outside of the moridani base floating few metres from the hatchway which tsiryfeylen had blasted tethered by thin plastic cable she had gone outside primarily to get away from the others to try and sort out what was going on from what she had seen tsiryfeylen was nt deceiving her about the imminent destruction of humanity what could she do about it ninety years of existence under the rule of the nosannoos had convinced mankind of the futility of opposition the only thing she could think to do was to warn the government what was left of it somehow she heard tactful click over her suit phones as marek drifted out of the hatch to join her come back inside kelanie feel nervous with you floating around out here she reached over and took his suit hand in hers tugged gently on the tether with her other hand bouncing off the edge of the hatch as they passed through it the black glass formed behind them as they settled to the deck air rushed in through vents ranked along the bottom of the walls marek opened his suit climbed out after activating sequence that would command it to walk back to the docking bay by itself the suit snapped shut shuffled around them both and moved off kelanie still in her suit followed marek back to the berth that they shared on the journey to the asteroid base she stopped outside the round doorway still lost in thought marek knocked on the front of her suit come on out know you re in there somewhere abruptly the suit opened and marek reached in unbuckling the securing straps lifting her out of the suit trailing monitor leads and cables one by one he carefully peeled the contacts from her skin kissing the places where they had been attached she hugged him one arm around his neck running her hand down his back with sudden desperation kissing him and dragging him into the berth tears beginning to leak from beneath her tightlyclosed eyelids her hand brushed the keys of her notepad which began to play some soft ambient music all crashing ocean waves whale song and distant bass tones as marek stroked open the contact strip that held the front of her jumper together pushing it aside kissing her breasts and throat she lay back on the mats which marek had been sleeping on breathing deeply biting her lip from the effort of suppressing the despair she felt three large insects zipped into the room circled over the entwined pair and scenting the pheromones flew out again tsiryfeylen was silent as she wiggled her fingers in the control spaces on the flightcolumn of the nosannoos freighter which turned backed away from the asteroid which was still heading directly towards earth swung around it and overtook it kelanie marek and kayren stood behind her watching the view in front of the ship displayed on the main screen kendrsaranaxio entered wearing battlesuit kayren swaying slightly to avoid the rhinocerossized mass as it passed the suit cracked open and kendrsaranaxio stepped out shaking her legs she said using two of her voices we are taking great risk but we have decided to use threequarters of our offensive potential to divert as many asteroids as we can get away with there are three more stolen freighters arriving from other parts of the galaxy we intend to lift as many humans off earth as we can before the bythians can retaliate we are going in first though to pick up the cargo we originally intended to marek asked weapons did nt think that humanity had any kendrsaranaxio bared her teeth at him he grinned back we have been stockpiling cci missiles on earth for the past nine years but we are nt going in for them we have also been stockpiling information history music art that sort of thing that stockpile is our primary concern tsiryfeylen said tersely in bythian yl chuev chto ty valyf li svayen valyf kendrsaranaxio replied if it is mistake we do nt think that there will be time to feel embarrassed about it she turned to the two humans and said apologetically my sister has been living safely on millimillenary for so long that she has lost her sense of adventure tsiryfeylen retorted sardonically my sister has been out gunrunning in the asteroids for so long that she has lost her sense of proportion with regard to risk evaluation kendrsaranaxio held up hand extended one finger then another withdrawing them both the kaelen antennaesignal that represented amusement tsiryfeylen activated bank of six monitors to her left screens filled with verticallyrun static that faded to reveal views along the side of the freighter tsiryfeylen explained missiles we will send them ahead of us in case there are any bythians lurking around we will leave them in orbit while we go down for the cargo each view shuddered and changed in turn as the missiles were launched accelerating furiously the bright star that was their destination swelling appreciably as they watched kendrsaranaxio said you humans can feel proud of those missiles the drives were stolen from the nosannoos as were the cci warheads but control for each missile is provided by prototype artificial intelligences developed on earth so you can begin to understand why the nosannoos fear you would you like to chat with missile kelanie relieved that something was going to be done to avert the holocaust that she still could nt encompass grinned at marek what can you say to missile goodbye how to show kaelen that you appreciate the joke it told you if you do nt have antennae use your fingers it isnt necessary to hold them up next to your temples make fist extend your index finger then extend your little finger while withdrawing the index finger then withdraw the little finger into your fist again significant delay between the index and little finger movements is interpreted as sarcasm so be careful let speak kaelen chapter one the export appeared deserted scrap of paper blew out of one of the gaping hangar doors across the concrete oval of the landing pad it fluttered and then was swept aside as the nosannoos freighter settled to the pad as softly as balloon ramp extruded from the pad extending upwards to the hatch that opened just as the ramp reached the ship two moridani battlesuits ran down the ramp across the export and into the hangar followed by two smaller battlesuits they re not here yet kelanie scanned with her boommounted cameras moving aside as tsiryfeylen ran out of the hangar followed by six crates that floated ten centimetres off the ground kelanie moved into the hangar which looked like it had been the subject of raid conducted by heavy earthmoving gear cubicles and desks pushed over to one side of the building two gaping holes in the back wall crates were piled conspicuously in the bare centre of the floor kendrsaranaxio was darting from one crate to another checking labels occasionally slapping crate on the side when she did this the crate lifted from the ground and floated towards one of the holes in the back wall curious kelanie walked around to the rear of the hangar and watched in fascination as the crates floated in single file to landing pad where they popped open revealing white metal sphere about metre in diameter the spheres rotated aligning themselves with some invisible signal and then shot off into the sky faint thunder of series of distant sonic booms sounded from above the last of the spheres executed an impossibly sharp rightangle turn just after it launched darting off behind kelanie she turned and seeing distant speck in the sky increased the magnification of her suit camera it could nt be nosannoos craft it was moving too slowly it resembled bus painted in camouflage green and brown with two hazy circles wavering over each end the sphere shot towards the machine taking up position underneath it kelanie ran back to the hangar where kendrsaranaxio was giving loading instructions to the crates someone coming think it might be my friends kendr saranaxio slapped the last crate which lifted spun around and floated off towards the freighter according to the telemetry from the missile it an antique helicopter human technology three people on board it has only shortwave electronic radio which we do nt have transceivers for she ran back outside to where marek suit stood open marek angled the suit back staring at the sky wrinkling his nose in distaste this air smells funny he said she beckoned to him as the helicopter approached dipping unevenly towards the grass next to the freighter the rear rotor cut out completely dropping the machine to the ground from height of about three meters the chassis crumpling slightly as it hit marek snapped his suit shut and kelanie ducked as the copter tilted over on one side the rotors chopping into the ground snapping off and flying in all directions the craft shaking like an animal in the throes of some haemotoxic poison when it had finally settled the rear of the machine opened haltingly then broke off three figures jumped out freezing when they saw the battlesuits approaching kelanie shouted through her suit external speaker gen gaeren some ninety thousand kilometres away bythian scout flew parallel course to roughly eggshaped nickeliron asteroid thirtytwo kilometres along its longitudinal axis turning endoverend once every twentyone minutes occasionally the bythian navigator glanced over the radar display not expecting to see anything but keeping watch all the same suddenly it spotted three blips on the extreme edge of the radar field at the next sweep there were fifteen blips it did nt waste any time it thrust fingers into controlspaces launching volley of missiles each no larger than football designed simply to get in front of target and disintegrate leaving cluster of debris moving at high speed as soon as the missiles were away the blips scattered changing course with smoothness only possible for ships driven by nosannoos impeller engines the bythian immediately sent an alarm to threat termination control but before it could specify the nature of the problem the first blip had arrived at its destination directly between the asteroid and the scout it paused there for moment and the navigator considered lobbing some more missiles at it when it vanished in pinpoint of white light flare of vaporised rock spreading out from the leading shoulder of the asteroid the navigator did nt bother throwing its arms up in front of its face which would have been useless gesture its last act was to launch all its missiles in the general direction of the line of blips three projectiles made it out of the scout launching bay before hail of asteroidfragments riddled the ship tearing it to pieces the bythian did nt survive to see the other fourteen blips reach their target and detonate each pushing the asteroid several degrees off its course remember military targets only be sure you hit nothing except bases dumps roads factories bridges trains ships houses fields forests buildings vehicles or anything else that may look suspicious handelsman tsiryfeylen was in the freighter talking with two other moridani who were on their way to earth it going to be nightmare she said with degree of disgust kendrsaranaxio is getting sentimental anyway it appears that there are almost twice as many asteroids as we accounted for so by the time you get here the planet will be disaster area the system will be swarming with bythians we re tempted to cut and run the first wave of diversionmissiles will have reached their targets by now what is the latest projection with regards to threat termination finding out what going on tsiryfeylen transmitted complex fourdimensional datastructure showing how many of the eight hundred and ten scouts nursemaiding the projectiles were expected to survive the detonation of the diversionmissiles and what the chances were of any of the survivors being able to report we agree it is going to be nightmare we will have to arrange temporary living quarters for how many eleven hundred eleven hundred humans on triples and beckett we ca nt see that many humans coexisting peacefully inside nosannoos freighters for more than week tsiryfeylen narrowed her eyes grinning maybe that is just what we need she closed the connection instructed her suit to take her outside to check on the cargo loading she saw the five humans sitting on the edge of the loading ramp and waved as she passed grinning to herself when she saw the looks of surprise on the faces of kelanie friends kelanie had been fielding their questions assisted by marek and the odd comment thrown in by kendrsaranaxio as she ran past herding crates into the freighter gaeren tuuri tall thin neuter who had worked with kelanie in the bureau of procuration was describing the chaos that the nosannoos withdrawal had produced it was like mob of children who just been let out of school what surprised me was the number of murders that occurred you dont realise just how violent most people are underneath the thin veneer of civilisation he shuddered genesis one of kelanies associates from her days in the anarchartist terrorist absurdist organisation was scanning through the notes she collected during her stay on millimillenary he found picture of the bythianhired assassin the one they called the barber this up until three weeks ago there were dozens of these xenos all over the place accompanied by squads of bythians mileva barker exav thief and streetgang leader had taken liking to marek kelanie felt obliged to warn her in lowlevel street talk to be careful with him or else you will have me to answer to tsiryfeylen noted that the hangar was now empty she turned back to the ship stopping at the ramp and opening up her suit she resisted the impulse to bare her teeth at kelanie friends unless you are expecting anyone else we should go it appears that we have nt been one hundred percent successful in stopping the asteroids and our best estimates give us less than half an hour to get clear we have successfully diverted approximately six hundred and fifty of the eight hundred and ten projectiles the remaining few have been blown off course but we ca nt be sure exactly where they ll land until they enter the atmosphere because the bythian scouts that survived the attacks have been trying to push them back on course kendrsaranaxio joined them opening her suit and scaring mileva by grinning broadly scraping her teeth together and producing the sound which kelanie had once compared to that of knives being sharpened baylaldelvoykendrteff reports that there are some military transports on their way from bythe prime and you can believe that they are nt just stopping by to say hello we have allocated the rest of the diversionmissiles to targeting the remaining scouts so with degree of luck all the asteroids will miss earth giving us enough time to get as many people off as we can fit into two nosannoos freighters kelanie said did nt you say that there were three freighters on their way kendrsaranaxio narrowed her eyes abruptly closed her suit and ran up the ramp into the ship tsiryfeylen hissed exposing her fangs the hands of her suit clenching and unclenching and then turned to run after kendrsaranaxio there was moment of embarrassed silence marek hefted the case of handweapons which mileva had stolen from the museum in which they found the helicopter and started up the ramp after the two moridani come on kelanie the last one up the ramp paused in the hatchway and turned to look at the export one last time twinkling light far off in the sky caught her attention she closed her suit aimed boommounted camera in the general direction of the light magnified the view it appeared to be moving downwards slowly and as she watched glowing fragments broke off and spun away she blew into the voiceactivated microphone and said tsiryfeylen can you see that object in the sky to the east of us there was pause after which the ramp fell away and the hatch closed almost chopping off the end of kelanie boommounted camera she stumbled back slightly as the ship lifted kelanie secure yourself we have projectile coming in on us tsiryfeylen said an asteroid she instructed her suit to run back to the freighter control room passing her friends on the way there while she tried to find an external camera that could show her the projectile in any detail she could hear fragments of conversation the choppiness of the voiceactivated microphones becoming annoyingly obvious as she tried to filter some meaning out of the words primary diversion was successful at least it not going to hit the residential area ing thing is going to hit us though if we do nt get moving now kelanie are you secured she halted her suit headlong rush threw herself down to lie spreadeagled on the floor hands and feet locking against the sides of the corridor yes secure what going to she heard thump which even through the walls of the ship was obviously somewhere below them followed by jarring blow which hit her in the stomach as the ship was buffeted by the strike had she been standing at the time she would have ended up at the far end of the corridor in heap the ship rocked like leaf over bonfire as she scrambled to her feet stumbling down the passage in the control room her friends were clustered in corner while the two moridani stood at the control columns busily directing their dwindling supply of intelligent missiles towards their targets one of tsiryfeylen component personalities took the time to inform them it looks bad children the napaisub for this system caught on to us quickly they are definitely worried about you kelanie still in her suit went to column off to one side out of the moridanis way she patched her suit display into the control column and sorted through the various views available from outside monitors eventually finding one that showed the earth below them there was turbulent grey field of cloud directly underneath them where the asteroid had hit her eyes widened as two more projectiles passed by on parallel courses glowing an angry red colour one of them less than fifty metres from the ship something zipped across the screen curving to track the nearer of the two asteroids which were dwindling rapidly in the distance there was an intense white flare momentarily rendering everything in stark black shadows when it had faded the first asteroid chunks breaking away was drifting towards its companion as kelanie increased the magnification to keep them in view they collided the first asteroid breaking up into four smaller pieces the second pushed off course she opened her suit sitting it down on its knees staring at the screen as it tracked the asteroid until it hit on the edge of the residential block about five kilometres from the export the view which was already heavily aliased due to the extreme magnification became completely obscured by dust but she knew that anyone in that part of residential block would be dead she looked up at tsiryfeylen despairingly is nt there anything we can do tsiryfeylen kept flicking her fingers in and out of the controlspaces and replied tersely there is and we are doing it if you would like to help go down to the secondary cargo bay and look for crate marked vayasch cheyr we hate to think that it got left behind requesting connection connection established connection established who is this identify yourself we have data packet for you repeat identify yourself look ca nt accept this data transmitting without identif oh all right receiving end of file checksum a3e453c36c confirmed now who is this closing connection what oh very well it must have been some sort of online function test now let have look at this data packet it seems fairly selfexplanatory it seems fairly selfexplanatory it seems fairly selfexplanatory it seems fairly selfexplanatory it h9 cpu halted kayren being more familiar with nosannoos equipment was able to get patch from the multitude of transmissions that the moridani were receiving from their smart missiles scattered throughout nearby space the humans sat in the cargo bay and watched as the pthalklin ervae expertly adjusted multiscreen holographic display the views changing every thirty seconds most of them were incomprehensible some were streaked with the dotpatterns that the moridani used for telemetry others were blank or obscured by static whenever they found an interesting view they froze the display on that channel until the missile that was sending it was destroyed kelanie sat behind the others in her battle suit her hands clenched around the grips of the handmanipulator controls they were getting fragmentary view of the carnage that the moridani had been unable to prevent huge chunks of rock ploughing into heavilypopulated centres with the strength of atomic weapons the shock waves knocking buildings flat in circles for kilometres around she tried to treat it like some sort of documentary specialeffect but it did nt make her feel any better after watching the eighth or ninth city being demolished she slammed her suit shut and stamped out momentarily marek turned as if to follow her but could nt think of anything reassuring to say and instead folded himself up behind crate his head in his hands when she got to the control room both moridani were motionless watching single monitor on which telemetry information flashed past at rate too fast for her translator to even register tsiryfeylen what happening no answer she walked her suit over to stand between the xenos opened it their attention didnt waver kelanie sat in her suit trying for minute to decide whether interrupt them she was about to speak again when both turned sharply to look at each other baring their teeth and hissing display that almost made kelanie hair stand on end kendrsaranaxio stretched shaking her rear legs and tsiryfeylen said we think we may have just halted earth napaisub if we have succeeded then we stand chance of getting those nine hundred people off earth safely kendrsaranaxio opened communications channel to one of the other stolen nosannoos freighters began chatting with another moridani tsiryfeylen took kelanie aside sat on one of their grey patterned rugs her legs folding neatly underneath we gravely underestimated the importance that the nosannoos placed on your extermination we had been monitoring the communications between the napaisubs but it appears that this exercise was planned privately between the local napaisub and napai we have managed to get both freighters down on earth and fully loaded we are now waiting for an opening before we can lift them to safety kelanie felt an ache behind her eyes matched by nervous feeling in her stomach as if she were about to perform on stage in front of thousands of people tsiryfeylen was watching her closely kelanie said in small voice you ve seen this happen before have nt you six times this is the third time we ve been involved in an rescue we have some idea of the anguish you are experiencing kelanie closed her eyes as the feeling got worse we do nt cry but if we could we would the seminauseous feeling vanished abruptly replaced by anger would have thought that you be used to it by now she sneered tsiryfeylen raised an index finger in warning we had friends on earth too do nt for one minute think that you have some sort of monopoly on grief around here start to think that when you have seen this game played out few more times when you have seen more sentient beings killed than you thought existed start to think that when the nosannoos are hunting for you personally and will kill anyone who gets in their way to find you start to think that when you find that you can not trust anyone or befriend anyone for fear that they will be killed by the nosannoos kelanie stared up at the alien for moment then broke the contact by abruptly shutting her suit and running off down the corridor she found herself in the corridor where she had backhanded the bythian almost severing its head she opened her suit undid the securing straps and stood up in it bringing her head level with yellow stain on the white ceramic wall bythian blood she reached out and ran her fingers over it idly scraping some of it off with her fingernails she heard someone marek judging from the sound of his bare feet approaching she laid her hand flat against the wall turned to face him in the short time that he had known her marek had never seen her with an expression like the one she presented now it was look that conveyed icy relentless resolve the look of obsession we will give them good reason to fear us she said this file is copyright nikolai kingsley 1995
