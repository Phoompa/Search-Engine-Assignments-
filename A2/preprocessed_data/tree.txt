the marina was full of its usual saturday morning noises on this particularly halcyon august day there had been spell of heavy rain the week before and with the skies clear and temperature high vacationers and lakegoers were abundant small troupe of gulls were making their way across the fairway catching many an unwary fish who ventured too close to the surface the ten oclock sun cast its rays into the water causing the few bellyup fish on the surface to glisten the sailboat masts pierced the sky and the speedboat engines chortled in the morning air boaters were washing their vessels readying for lovely cruise on lake erie few children accompanied by their parents seemed calmed by the lakes hypnotic serenity kevin drove by the dock which held his parent boat nope his parents were nt there yet just as he figured when his parents go boating they usually do nt arrive at the marina until about noon you wan na drive around for while kevin asked his girlfriend sloane yeah let go up to east harbor she replied pushing the long brown hair out of her face with that kevin maneuvered the car out of the marina and onto the main raod sloane hit the power button on the radio which caused the speakers to emit an upbeat tune sloane was lightly entertained by the scrolling trees and lake backfront as they drove the shore looks picture perfect today you want me to get my camera out he mocked her half serious no just saying it pretty you know smiling kevin pulled the car onto the side of the road okay now where my camera he said as he groped along the back seat of his latemodel sports car finding it they quickly left the car and went over to the trees they were in roadside cemetary about fifty yards from the lake its sort of pretty in wierd sort of way sloane commented on her surroundings yeah kevin replied fiddling with his minolta why do nt you go over there he pointed toward an old oak stump about eight feet high whose branches had long fallen off it stood just beyond the last and oldest footstone like lighthouse on rocky beach with the light blue sky and tranquil shoreline both readily in view it would be great backdrop now turn around and smile he called out to her she was in perfect focus in the viewfinder next to the massive stump an occasional boat dotted the lake kev cmere this is nt tree he was momentarily confused what do you mean it is nt tree he went to see what she was rambling about look she was right it was large intricately carved granite replica of tree with elaborate bark lines and even small bird nest accurately depicted on top from relatively close distance even five or six yards it looked like venerable old tree closer inspection revealed small cross emblazoned on its south side and an inconspicuous epitaph on the bottom in small letters it said ledge 18521891 it pretty must have cost lot sloane said almost as good as kennedy memorial with the burning torch kevin sort of thought about what his headstone would one day read but quickly dismissed the thought who cares ll never be around to see it what sloane asked nothing let get something to eat hungry
