aligned together in sublime row few small snowswept pines dot the surrounding area in clusters of two or three the dry earth underneath holds the burlap from which they were wrapped now exposed to the wintry stillness the trees are illuminated by tall iron street lamps from the parking lot where cars lay like toys behind the fence the dark chocolate forest lays in black watercolor smear blending into the indigo december sky freezing rain pelts down with dismal syncopation the northern wind bangs against the gigantic leafless elm trees on the hill to the left their spidery limbs lay still and are veiled in the misty air the rainwater can be heard dripping into the sewers by the cars atop the hilly grass the snow is matted from rain and footprints it is this setting that jane gillcrest and ed thompson arrived for midnight sledding excursion jane had shown visible excitement in that she get chance to be with her friend in such neoromantic locale ed just wanted to relive his childhood glory as king of the toboggans they had no problem getting out of the house at eleventhirty on weeknight it was winter break just few days before christmas and as such neither of them had any pressing plans for the next morning except maybe get few lastminute gifts for the family which was to be expected the drive there was uneventful they had spent most of the time admiring some of the local christmas decorations that the ex hippies the yuppies and the future muppies had placed outside of their respective adobes standing atop sharp incline jane studied the gully it formed at the bottom where the thirty foot slope met the flat field you know do nt think there enough snow down there to cushion our sled her face bore thoughtful expression ed was already sitting down on his side of the sled waiting for her to board do nt worry about it it fine he said and almost added besides you ll be in front he patted the front of the sled and she reluctantly sat down in deference that last one was kinda close too the rain had hardened their clothes and beat into their faces when ed pushed them off the top his wet baseball cap barely covered his ears and was equally useless in keeping the rain off his head for brief moment they could see the entire forest surrounding the large white field that lay before them as the plastic tub dipped downward ed felt the euphoric feeling of complete loss of bodily control and heard jane let out fusillade of intense shouts her hands were bonded to the legs of his jeans those few seconds after breaking the precipice felt like suspended eternity to ed and the wetness that was about him took on sudden freshness the wind blowing in his face along with jane long golden hair was suddenly affable and carefree the sled glided down the hill almost completely without sound yet it seemed to scream with thunder not unlike jane vocal chords ed let out whoop when they careened to the bottom the sled hit the ditch with sudden force which flung them mercilessly from the sled breaking both of their screams with rude abruptness jane landed facedown in the snow and ed managed to become wedged between the hard ground and the nowcapsized sled they sat there for brief moment in the aftermath the cadence of constant rainfall in their ears jane shook herself up and surveyed the outcome of the debacle ooow my back is killing me oooow ed kept still under the sled fatuously feigning an injury hey eddie get up jane fumbled over to his body and tugged on his jacket eddie you okay eddie she looked down at his face ed let his mouth form slow grin and let out sheepish yeah let get back to the car do nt know about you but freezin jane agreed and the two of them limped back to the parking lot their spirits dwindling as the realization of their coldness crept over them when they got to ed car he had trouble getting the key to turn and they stood there shaking in the cold geesh this really helps things he thought cmon ed get that damn key in there finally get in he told her as he opened her door he threw the sled in the back seat atop his school books and snow scraper and started the car it took while for the car to warm up in the cold temperature and so ed had to refrain from turning on the heater god freezing my knees are just shaking he said jane admitted that they were but it looks cute she said with smile hate that word why she asked him because it sounds like something you call stuffed animal you know dog cute teddy bear cute but not cute he smiled at her she laughed in her characteristic style and said okay you re not cute at all when the windshield was defogged to ed level of satisfaction he turned on the lights and heater and pulled out of the parking lot it was down in the valley they drove up narrow road overlooking the slushy slopes and dark forest passing the pine conglomeration and left pinewood park they were silent for ways mesmerized by the windshield wipers which on slow speed perfectly swept the droplets of rain off the windshield in constant rhythmic fashion getting closer to jane house in the residential area of town ed took in his surroundings the midnight road the comfortable houses and the pine trees as they were climbing particularly big hill he saw milky white light expanding through the fog at the crest of the hill the moonlike glow outlined every detail on the top patch of road including the gravel and broken glass on the berm the pines near the road were showered with an energy like country sunrise it slowly rose until it momentarily blinded them then dividing into two distinct circles without flash or fanfare the smoky vapors disappeared and the roadside put its nighttime cloak back on as the passing car drove by jane that the best thing like about driving at night she was slightly startled by the abrupt break in the silence what is when you see the light from car overhill it beautiful it really is think it sort of universal symbol like beacon of hope does that mean anything or am just rambling no go on she looked interested that was an especially gratifying one he seemed to take his time inching along getting bigger and the hill was real big too with another moment of thought he continued it almost letdown when you see the car jane reached over to his hand that was beautiful gee thanks it was just something thought of oh hell feel sick jane my clothes are still wet how about yours not too bad ve got more vents on my side she directed some of the air vents on the dash toward ed thanks when you re sick the wet feels bad tugging at you wonder if have ryes syndrome jane laughed no silly that happens when you take aspirin when you have fever but it only happens to people our age teenagers ed felt slightly nervous and this was apparent in the way he spoke feeling really sick my stomach hurts and my heads pounding my bosses nephew died couple of months ago from ryes she was only sixteen younger than us she looked at him with compassion and said suck on an orange it ll clean out your system know how you feel even water feels like it has film on it so do nt have any that because of all the chemicals they pump into it yeah pepsi okay because it so carbonated and you cant taste the gunk just wan na get better the roads were slick from the freezing rain and clumps of snow and so he had to drive slowly they were following the yellow strobe of salt truck now and it looked like it was heading toward jane development funny ed thought he not putting down any salt soon police cruiser pulled out of side street onto the road heading in the opposite direction and the salt truck put its salt release on full ed did nt appreciate it very much lookit those jerks salt going all over the place it going to ruin my paint job the salt crystals whisked under his tires and crackled underneath the car ed was relived to pull into jane driveway and off the trail of the truck goodnight honey she said and gave him kiss get some rest you look awful so that why you like me is nt it he joked of course call me tomorrow bye he watched her run up to her door and get in half uninterested because of the throbbing in his body he pulled out of the drive at top speed and guided his car down the road passing the city hall on the way home he could nt help notice the elaborate christmas lights his ohio town had put up this year the multicolored lights shone through the misty night making the air cheery and bright hey it rhymes he thought too bad noone else is out tonight to see this he drove on driving down the hilly backroads of his city passing one of the white shoebox houses he looked at it front light which looked like the light on the heritage house food cartons at home it looked like some kind of beacon on the little whitewashed wooden pole the light refracted through the glass in several directions beacon he thought like the car lights he forgot about his physical pain and slowed down looking at the quaint house with its humble light in the front yard he thought about their sled trip and how fun it was it was like art he mused even the greatest artists never accomplished all that they wanted to or did they sure did nt finish doing everything ve wanted to there really is limited time to doing things god know that you ca nt have it all but guess this is the first time that realized that you ca nt even have substantial amount of it that depressing as hell ed thompson but it probably true so heaven must be eternal art or something and one thing is sure of life you re going to die and guess that when everything is complete ed continued towards home following the midnight road
