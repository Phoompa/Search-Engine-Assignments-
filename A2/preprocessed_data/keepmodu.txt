rpgnet aolcom dec 11993 odnaar keep by david millstein introduction odnaar keep is an adventure designed for the 2nd edition advanced dungeons and dragons roleplaying game it has numerous extremely difficult opponents and the party members should be of no less then twelfth level with suggested maximum of sixteenth good party would have around eighty combined levels or so there should be at least two mages two fighters and cleric is suggested dungeon master background approximately four centuries ago there lived rather famed and later feared barbarian fighter named kyarr battlewood after while his renown was so great that people began following him and he soon amassed an army kyarr erected large keep to house it naming it odnaar after his barbarian clan but power corrupted kyarr his army began pillaging nearby villages then towns and even launched shortlived war against neighboring country until it was apparent battlewood would be defeated as an addition to his army battlewood reputedly attempted capturing young red dragon they managed to bring it back to the keep but it escaped causing great havoc and then something happened terrifying shriek was heard and furious storm raged across the countryside legend says that the dragon summoned some thing from another world and that it decimated kyarr and his army all give odnaar keep safe distance only very small number of either stupid or brave adventurers have dared enter and as expected have nt been heard from since what actually happened may be even worse the dragon that battlewood army captured flameburst was an intelligent one and though fairly young was well studied in dark things flameburst had recently learned of rituals to contact the outer planes of existence when he was captured when he was captured he burst free from his prison and entered kyarr tower there infuriated by the barbarian general attempt at imprisonment summoned pit fiend baatezu from the nine hells the fiend immediately demolished battlewood army and took up residence in his tower flameburst served as guardian and coruler of the empty keep currently the two are working on dark ceremony that will free from hell the chromatic dragon known as tiamat an evil being of great death and destruction with the help of her cleric thewyar they near the completion player background the pcs are assumed to be in the area perhaps as rest between adventures or maybe looking for work either way they come to the small town of turen as they come to the town square read the following the monotony of the warm summer day is broken by feminine voice shouting from turen town square you follow it the town square is filled with large crowd of perhaps fifty people in the center on raised dais stands an elven woman dressed in brown leathers short sword at her waist and large brown sack next to her but you must believe me she cries ah but we do believe ya answers villager shouts of agreement look we all saw the battle it was nt but two days ago now but we ai nt never been to the keep and there ai nt nothin makin us go ya hear the woman sinks her face into her hand when she looks up you note she been crying but there is an evil in that keep you all know that and soon it ll be powerful enough to kill you all we can still stop it you know it powerful no dragon simply attacks another for spite villager angry raises his hand in fist how do ya know so much about wyrms eh maybe yer in league with em never can trust pointear that what say few cries of approval though no one else argues his remark no one vocally agrees either then can not help any of you it saddens me to see there are no heroes left in this world my work has apparently been for naught losing my companions on the dangerous journey here was worthless too presume apparently so think may give myself to the creatures in the keep just to prove myself you realize not what destruction your cowardice will bring now would be an opportune time for the pcs to offer their services she will be flushed with happiness and brings them to local tavern the orc princess read the following the orc princess is rowdy place and the title fits as well when first entering your eyes are immediately drawn to the crude painting of an orc with flowing blond hair wearing long blue gown she carries several flowers in her hand and gives toothless smile the patrons are either guzzling beer armwrestling talking or sleeping the woman who introduces herself as salana nightblade tells the pcs to mingle while she finds table and orders meals the following are some encounters the pcs may have in the bar krugek the undefeated krugek is an uglylooking halforc who is sitting at table surrounded by onlookers he is rude man and is the current champion of an armwrestling game that been going on since last night the rules the rules of the game are simple contestant makes wager of at least gold piece and adds it to the purse which is currently at 15gp the

1d10 and consult the following for rumors concerning the keep the keep has become nesting ground for orcs who will guard it to the death false it protected by powerful antimagic spell so powerful that mages are actually injured when they come near it false an extremely evil monster has made it home in the tower true that sneak attack by the red dragon on that gold last night was because the gold was going towards the keep true there is gateway in the lower reaches of the keep that leads to another dimension false kyarr battlewood has managed to keep himself alive through dark magics and is amassing an army of undead false the entire treasure of the keep is still there untouched by anyone for whoever dares to go in there true the keep is now the domain of powerful lich named saadir he is transforming nearby orcs into undead soldiers for his army false though saadir is flameburst true name powerful highpriest of evil dragons is operating with an evil monster in the keep tower true 10 the gods themselves have taken up residence at the keep as way of spying on the mortal world false hey you thin wiry man is standing in corner and calls over the character with the lowest intelligence he asks if that character would like to make some easy cash the man explains that all he has to do is when no one is looking sneak behind the bar counter and get his ring which is in brown box this is trick the man whose name is jolen knows that box has the barkeeper emergency funds and is armed with trap that fires dart at whoever opens it causing 1d4 points of damage failure to save vs paralyzation results in paralysis for 1d6 rounds long enough for the innkeeper to throw the character out of the inn after little bit salana calls the characters over to the table and says the following suppose should tell you my story am salana nightblade of the quiarn elves have made it my duty to protect the wilderness from corruption by the forces of evil as hobby also study dragons about week ago first heard about odnaar keep in case you do nt know let me tell you odnaar keep was founded by powerful barbarian named battlewood about four hundred years ago he amassed huge army that was the fear of the land they attempted to imprison red dragon but it broke free and apparently destroyed him and his army now legend says that there is powerful evil that dwells in the tower at the keep possibly force other then the red dragon if that even still there now when heard of it crossreferenced the site of the red dragon capture and various sightings and other information and have deduced hat it is the dragon known as flameburst fought him once number of years ago when staying at village few hundred miles from here learned from jhem gold dragon acquaintance of mine that flameburst was very intelligent but was driven by severe megalomania he is obsessed with power and for decades had been trying to contact the outer worlds believe that he may of contacted something when he escaped from battlewood and that that is what decimated his army and is the source of these legends if that is so this force must be stopped there no telling what destruction will may be unleashed if they are nt are you with me the pcs should agree if they do salana allows them to ask any questions here answers to one they might ask any way to help us only this this is map obtained from the body of fairly powerful cleric that was found with his head torn off about mile from here once the pcs get up to leave turen salana says some more now last night huge battle erupted although the townsfolk do nt know know who and why it happened as was there was traveling here with some companions that met along the way and we made camp to await jhem who was going to help us convince the townsfolk to help us all of sudden saw her flying towards us coming from the direction of the keep tell you never in all my years have seen dragon so frightened and to see jhem like that she appeared to be flying stuttered as if wounded already but saw no wounds then flameburst appeared who been in hot pursuit of jhem that beast breathed it flame with jhem back turned the poor girl never had chance as it caused great damage saw jhem burning slam into the ground with mighty force but before could do anything flameburst swooped by and breathed upon our party just out of spite do not believe he recognized me was the only survivor the others were killed think we should investigate jhem body first there is something of ours that need proceed with the journey soon you come to clearing obviously not natural in origin smashed trees lay everywhere shattered into thousands of little splinters at the middle of the clearing is heartbreaking sight huge hulking gold dragon it can only be dragon lies still it back burned black tens of little insects swarm over it body under it seeps out gigantic puddle of drying gold dragonblood it is turned so that it rump is facing you and you get good view of the damage cause from flameburst breath as the pcs begin to investigate salana walks around to the other side as you come closer to the dead creature you hear loud shriek the voice can only be salana you run to the other side of the corpse to find salana mouth wide open and she is pointing downward jhem head is gone hundreds of little maggots are thriving on the dragonmeat have the pcs make an intelligence check at anyone succeeding notices the ending of several large cuts on the bottom of the dragon you realize this should nt be since salana said that it was killed only by flameburst breath the only way to get better view of the cuts is to roll jhem over salana will suggest this if the players do nt combined str of at least 50 is required to turn jhem over if they accomplish this feat read there is loud thump as the dragon rolls onto its back the drying dragonblood sloshes off it stomach slowly like molasses the entire bottom of jhem is covered in two to three foot long gashes aside from the expected blood in the gashes there is strange crusty purplish material around them this is the dried poison of the pit fiend see npcs also the entire stomach is brown the results of the beginning of the disease that the fiend gave to jhem if for whatever reason the crust comes into contact with liquid like water or the stillnot dried dragonblood it will become the poison that pit fiend has it can either be ingested through the mouth or will take effect 1d10 rounds if left on the person salana will be even more surprised she kneels down next to the body resting her head against it this is this is horrible wanted to come to jhem to take magical necklace she wore since she said should take it if anything ever befell her but why would her head be removed and what caused these wounds those are not the wounds caused by dragon claws we must make haste to the keep and they will do so it is about days travel to odnaar keep through deep forest part of the day and plains for the rest salana will prefer to rest as little as possible but will finally agree after about half days walking once they make camp run event you are all about to settle in for the night when you suddenly feel large gust of wind from the west running up to the edge of the hill you are camping on you see gigantic silhouette of some huge winged horned creature flying through the air the shape swoops down above an herd of grazing cattle the cattle let out childish cries and whimpers and begin running in all different directions suddenly an enormous pillar of flame launches out from the shape making the night seem like the morning it also lets you see what the shape is dragon red dragon to be exact and very large one salana whispers flameburst get down get down or he ll see us as you duck down the flame ends and the remaining cattle scared of the huge bonfire burning their fellows run straight towards flameburst the dragon gives them hellish grin scoops about seven of them up and swoops off to the west you stay down for full minute before the shape disappears protected by the darkness of the night salana walks back to camp silently and calls you over returning to the camp you see that salana has next to her large sack embroidered in gold brought along some powerful magical items that will help us but was waiting to know if we definitely need them now know that we do it is magical bag larger on the inside then on the out salana reaches in pulling out long majestic two handed sword with an ivory hilt carved into the shape of winged muscled men it is covered with runes small shield completely metallic and cool to the touch blue potion golden suit of plate mail perfect in every way and single arrow with black feathers covered in arcane runes these are powerful items that ve gathered its taken me long time to get them all so please distribute them among those that can use them best do not know what they do except for the potion imbibing it grants the drinker the breath of blue dragon out of her bag of holding salana has produced the following in order sword versus evil creatures small shield versus red dragon breath potion of blue dragon breath suit of plate mail an arrow of evil dragon slaying 2d10 hp dmg to one the party can now rest and continue on their way odnaar keep the pcs along with salana now come to the entrance of odnaar keep once within sight do not roll for random encounters as thewyar flameburst and the fiend have managed to scare or kill everything nearby read you now come to what can only be the entrance to odnaar keep it is surrounded with twelvefoot stone circular wall which surprisingly is crumbling in few places weeds creep over it though like mother arms around her child the only apparent entrance in is through front gate long since rusted to brittleness next to the gate is large stone engraved with the following in form of old common odnaar keep home of the army of lord battlewood bringer of death the gate can easily be smashed open by anyone with strength of 12 or more careful inspection shows that there are two skeletons near the gate buried by centuries of dust and dirt the following is the listing of areas for odnaar keep use the map of the keep each number corresponding with its description here if the pcs enter the tower skip to that section every ten minutes there cumulative 10 chance they ll meet thewyar and 1d10 gnoll followers area south entrance you stand at the entrance to odnaar keep on either sides of you for about thirty feet are buildings caved in on many sides very far down though you see large stone tower in state of disrepair right in front of the tower is huge dark hole cold breeze runs through the air area barracks these are the buildings to the left of the pcs they used to house the soldiers this is large building apparently used to house great number of people most of the ceiling has caved in and everything looks burned skeletons lie everywhere you can make out number of beds some of which have burned skeletons in them if the pcs decide to search the place they may things of interest to be found are chest holding beautiful battle axe large box under bed locked containing 568 gp large iron key see area 17 pit tunnel area guard outpost these were made to see if an advancing army was approaching skeleton lies in each anyone entering must make dexterity check or smash through the rotted floor taking 1d4 hit points of damage area well it first looks like small circular hole when approached read this hole is apparently well as you bend down to look inside you suddenly realize the odd slant of the ground here and teeter over the edge anyone failing dexterity check falls 20 to the bottom of the well at the bottom is about two feet of water coming in from now defunct pipe that led to sincedried up underground lake the fall disturbs zombie the zombie was originally an adventurer killed by thewyar changed into zombie and thrown down here he is particularly rancid one as he has become bloated and even more rotted from his constant exposure to water zombie ac mv smashed legs hd hp 16 at dmg 18 al thac0 19 xp 65 the zombie carries short sword rusted so that it has penalty it wears suit of ring mail rusted to nothingness the only way out of the well is either through three successful dexterity checks at or by surface member throwing down rope event disagreement suddenly there is the sound of beating wings and loud rush of air you recognize the huge shape of flameburst emerge from the night sky and swoop down to the roof of the tower light goes on in the top of the room sending yellow rays through the window holes there is low grumbling as the dragon whispers something loud hellish voice responds in fact it sounds as if ten different people speak at once no no you worthless scum require more bejienroot not hooves grass it will be too late by the time you figure out what to do the dragon nostrils flare up mock me not gathaur you are but pawn in the queen scheme shall get your damned bejienroot only because have the knowledge that she ll dine on you once we free her the voice replies perhaps she ll find your scaled hide more to her liking flameburst let out bah and swoops away from the tower over your heads he want me to be his slave we ll see about that the dragon lets out billowing blast of red fire and it hits nearby building which explodes into fire the dragon flies off into the night and the light goes out in the tower what just occurred is that gathaur the pit fiend has been gathering ingredients for the summoning ritual flameburst has been out looking for bejienroot an ingredient but returned with the wrong one by accident they argued and in fit of rage flameburst set fire to the stables the party has ten rounds to explore it before it burns to the ground area stables this is where kyarr kept the army horses it in pretty good condition for wooden building if they pcs enter after saadir has burned it keep count for how many rounds it been burning at the end of the tenth round it collapses to the ground causing 2d10 points of damage otherwise every round in here while it burns means player must make dexterity check at or be hit by burning wood for 2d4 points of damage this building looks like it was used to hold something large rotted wood fence surrounds it there are number of oddly shaped skeletons in front of it anyone making wisdom check recognizes them as horse skeletons if they enter read entering the building you find what appears to of once been horse stalls it quite possible you re in stable more skeletons lie around in the stall immediately to your right there is large chest it is badly burned and skeleton is draped over it as if protecting it this chest was used by soldier to hide his belongings anyone opening it without disarming or checking for traps receives 1d6 points of damage from noxious gas and must save vs breath weapon or faint for 1d6 rounds inside the chest is 56 gp long sword vs dragons suit of plate mail there is also torn and battered brown book written in old common anyone making wisdom check or with the ancient languages proficiency can read it it is the journal of yuarr bladestrike highranking fighterpriest in kyarrs army most of it is daily things such as various holidays of his patron deity odin the last entry is important read journal fear this is the last time write to you at this moment the huge red beast that we captured for lord battlewood which had barricaded itself in the room we built for it has flown out of the whole it created and is killing our men as for the chanting heard earlier it may be something just came out of the pit it is tall thing it horrible claws wings it using magic my god we re all being slaughtered odin save us please allfather do nt let it it coming this way must quickly hide you and arm the chest pray will be able to returnit just broke the door down my fate is surely sealed pray it does nt find my father weapon nightsbane there may be way to stop the beast its name it name was run event event dragon fury suddenly the familiar sound of beating wings returns disrupting your reading loud bellow shakes the foundations of the building think not scum suddenly the roof of the building tears away and the starry night sky and moons shine down upon you but blocking the light is flameburst holding the roof in his hands he flies lower fools you obviously have nt learned of what happens to those who enter the keep uninvited flameburst drops the roof onto the party putting out the fire but causing 2d8 point of damage to anyone inside making dexterity check at halves the damage flameburst now flies off and enters his lair the diary is now lost in the rubble characters should search for it so use the following to determine if its found everyone has base chance of 30 add 10 for every point of dexterity above 13 subtract 10 for every point below add for every point of intelligence for every point above 13 and subtract five for every point below add 10 for those with infravision if found they learn that the red beast true name is saadir area armory this stone building has stood fairly well over the last few centuries it is easy to tell that this building was an armory of some sort crushed breastplates and wooden molds lie across the floor in one part of the wall is what looks to be forge the door is shut loud monotonous banging comes from inside inside of the forge is slightly different form of zombie originally traveling mage assaulted by thewyar

horrid sight the rotted body of man appears to be stuck in the forge it left foot chained to the wall it still moving even though it right arm is facing the wrong way and constantly banging on the wall until you opened it it looks up at you lets out load moan and begins chanting something it will cast it wizard lock first then attack with it other spells when lowered below hp hell attack using

interest in the building area prison entrance this wooden door set in the ground leads to the keep prison it is wizard locked once opened the pcs see stairway leading down into darkness area 10 warden room this is where iiaar oldhammer the warden lived all rooms in the prison are devoid of any light so the pcs will need torches or some other form of light the stairway winds down into large once luxurious room large brown desk is near one side of the wall various yellowed papers covering it bed is pushed up against another wall there is large wooden chest in the corner but it was apparently smashed open and everything taken out there is yellowed scroll pinned northern door with knife iiaar and the keep mage vtaar firehand knew of the slaughter going on upstairs and did there best to prevent anything coming down here and barricaded themselves in here with the prisoners they succeeded there are no encounters including thewyar here accept for listed ones attempts to read the scroll should be handled as per the diary it reads if you are of lord battlewood army or are he please forgive our cowardice we are too fearful of the consequences of the beasts on the surface and have decided to stay here until my magic detects no evil the prisoners have agreed to our plan hopefully our food and water supply will last us signed iiaar oldhammer prison warden vtaar firehand keep mage the door is also wizard locked area 11 mage room this room is originally where vtaar lived and worked but later iiaar moved in you enter another room similar to the previous there is another northern door wide open with etched wording in the stone above it two beds are pushed next to each other here long wooden table is in the middle of the room various potions line it also laying on red velvet pillow are two wands one red one blue both covered in runes there is large porcelain bowl on the table filled with gold pieces iiaar and vtaar lived here after flameburst and gathaur attack the wands belonged to vtaar the red wand is wand of magic missiles with 12 charges left it fires four magic missiles per charge each doing 1d41 points of damage the command word is harm the blue wand is wand of healing with 14 charges left each charge heals 1d81 points of damage the command word is heal the porcelain bowl contains 421 gp area 12 main prison this rectangular stone room is very cold half of it is separated by great number of iron bars part of which are door the cell contains at least twenty skeletons all huddled together few laid out on the other side of the cell hands across their chests leaning against the bars is another skeleton draped in torn purple robes it neck is broken in the east side of the wall is an open door leading into more darkness this is the prison where criminals were held the prisoners were given one ration daily of minimal food as iiaar and vtaar wanted the food for themselves one day when vtaar went to give them their food they had already been driven mad and they grabbed him and broke his neck this angered iiaar who decided to kill them all he first went into the solitary confinement room area 13 but fell into the pit and died of starvation and cold the prisoners slowly died off resulting in cannibalism the skeleton of vtaar wears ring of protection it holds flask containing potion of healing pouch with gem worth 200 gp and longdead mouse that died feeding on some of his herbs century ago inside the cell next to skeleton is vtaars quarterstaff if the players enter the cell sudden transparent form appears over one of the skeletons it is dressed in long tattered garments floats few inches off the ground and simply stares at the pcs unless they have vtaar wands in which case it floats right up to them staring the carrier in the eye spectre ac mv 15 fl 30 hd 73 hp 37 at dmg 18 sa energy drain sd or better to hit al le thac0 13 ml 15 the spectre was one of the inmates who murdered three soldiers and was imprisoned out of all of the inmates he hated being here the most and was rewarded with an undead life upon his death if the pcs approach the other doorway read suddenly the spectre floats in front of the doorway and says in an ancientsounding voice there is great treasure and emotion in that room ive had long time to brood over it as long time as had to wait here you wo nt enter without solving my riddle am child and am an elder destroy mountains and keeps and grant power to dragons am yearned after by some hated by others and none can escape my grasp the correct answer is age the spectre will allow any by if they answer correctly except for anyone with vtaar wands saying he may only pass if the wands are thrown down the pit giving the wrong answer results in the spectre shouting join me and it lifts up the pc dropping him into the cell whose door is wizard locked area 13 solitary confinement hole this was where highly dangerous criminal was kept they were fed every two days usually diseased dog meat or feces and rancid water dropped to the floor this room smells of death and decay which is surprising considering the age of the keep there is no light at all and even your own barely penetrates it as you enter you suddenly realize that there is hole in the center of the floor about four feet in diameter all pcs must make dexterity check at to avoid falling into the 30 pit at the bottom of the pit are two skeletons now intermingled with each other one is of the last confined here crazy murderer sentenced to three months here the other is iiaar who fell into the pit accidentally iiaar was armed with sword and quickly slew the madman but eventually starved and froze to death anyone falling down here will be able to take iiaars short sword his chain mail and his cloak anyone falling down here will realize that the circular stone walls are perfectly smooth and climbing out is impossible the only way out is by using rope there is rope in the far corner of the room but it is only 20 long as iiaar was forced to cut some of it to tie up some prisoners once anyone in the pit must secretly make an intelligence check at if succeeding the pc will find number of loose bricks revealing narrow tunnel that leads to flameburst lair also as note every day spent in the pit lowers all ability scores saving throws armor class and thac0s by due to the cramped quarters ability scores never go below one and only physical ones plus charisma are effected it takes an equal amount of time to gain things back once the players attempt to leave the spectre will fly in attempting to shove character into the pit it will then fight until lowered to 10 or less hit points in which case it will retreat into the shadows area 14 the tower the outside of the crumbling blackstoned tower is surrounded by an iron fence rusting away large piles of dirt frequent the outside and hiding behind pile that is right near the two wooden doors is zombie golem programed to kill anyone not approved by thewyar thewyar has approved his gnolls or himself he did nt think of flameburst or gathaur as they rarely touch ground if the pcs can bring either here the golem will attack those first somehow sensing the greater danger zombie golem ac2 mv hd 18 hp 60 at dmg 3d63d6 al thac0 xp 17000 ml 20 if the pcs enter the tower skip ahead to the tower area 15 north entrance this entrance was used by the many merchants and soldiers entering and leaving the city as you come to this section of the northern wall you can make out at least ten eleven or human skeletons and several demihuman ones blocking the iron gates from closing is lone covered wagon it cloth torn and flapping in the wind blocking your view inside is large flap of cloth if the pcs enter the wagon read hundreds of rusted items are strewn across the rotting wood the skeletons of two humans are here along with fresher corpse of apparently bandit there is look of terror frozen on his face and his entire chest has been torn out he lies in dried pool of blood various insects are feeding on him the merchants who owned this wagon were attempting to leave when flameburst and gathaur rampaged but some angered soldiers killed them first the bandit is week dead and came to the keep unknowing of it legends seeking easy loot gathaur was out on rare midnight excursion found him killed him and threw him in the wagon search by the pcs will reveal 367 gp gems worth 400 gp each daggers shield suit of chain mail everything else is worthless now run event event recognition and death the nowfamiliar sound of flameburst wings breaks the sound of the breeze blowing and you all huddle closer inside the wagon so as to avoid his evil eyes but suddenly the beast terrifying face dripping greenish saliva unto the ground appears in front of the back entrance of the wagon grinning with it long yellowed fangs thought recognized you pointear your cursed treeluck may of saved you and your companions but your death is now unpreventable die foolish one flameburst breathes his weapon blowing the wagon apart and hitting salana straighton players may make dexterity roll at to avoid it but regardless take 1d62 damage from debris the red dragon swoops into the huge

his hoard the huge hole in the ground is at least thirty feet in diameter thousands of tiny splinters of wood and rock surround it there is tiny ladder leading down into darkness this ladder leads to area 17 thewyar uses it when going to talk to flameburst if pcs do nt use the ladder it is 20 drop area 17 pit tunnel the ladder leads down to long tunnel about twenty feet high it was not manmade but rather smashed through about fifty feet ahead you see large opening into room that gives off golden light flameburst has made this bigger over the years to accommodate his size he has also set up number of traps to stop any one from continuing if the pcs continue down the tunnel they will see statue about thirty feet from the opening of large insectoid creature wielding swords in each hand do not reveal it is statue yet the pcs activate magic mouth spell which says halt intruders you are entering the tomb of lord battlewood and to continue will bring the wrath of his faithful guardian demand you turn back and leave if the pcs continue the statue keeps repeating the message about 20 from the entrance there is trap rigged to bring stone part of the ceiling upon the party the wall

grate in the wall located about 20 from the ground though any falling character takes damage as if falling 10 since he is party cushioned by the hoard if encountered flameburst will not fight in his lair although not accessible by anyone high up there is large removable block of stone that flameburst puts all the various things needed for the summoning he does nt want these thixtwana or his hoard damaged so he will attempt to lead the pcs out of his lair there is 45 percent chance flameburst activates one of his traps as he wo nt be slowly flying through the tunnel but hastily swooping out if the pcs take any loot without releasing thixtwana the mage will tell flameburst when he returns in hopes of being released event the sacrifice at some time after the pcs explore the keep preferably after exploring the lair the following occurs the sound of flameburst wings is heard and you now instinctively take cover the dragon disappears down the large pit in front of the tower clanking noises

longer it will stick to your clothes for day on the wall directly in front of you is large rusty metal carving large circle with five tubes running out of it anyone making wisdom check recognizes it as symbol of tiamat the fiveheaded dragon there is 50 chance 1d4 of thewyar gnolls are here there is 50 chance for each one that they ll either be sleeping or awake most likely fighting with each other see the npc roster for their stats area 21 trapped room this room was set up by thewyar with the reluctant help of thixtwana to take care of looters permanent illusion has been set up making it look like the room is filled with gold pieces in actuality these are worthless wood chips found in one of the ruins that were put here further in the center of the room is large stone with glass covering on top inside the covering appears to be huge red ruby part of the illusion your mouths drop open in surprise when you enter this room though small there are large piles of gold pieces everywhere but most striking is the large stone in the center of the room on top of it is glass case inside the case sits the largest most perfect ruby you ve ever seen the case is engraved in common it reads the ruby of hcoutton od captured by lord battlewood if the glass case is touched the pcs are actually pushing down on the stone this causes the entire floor to give way dropping the characters 10 into area 26 area 23 stairway these stairs lead up to level area 24 elevator you open the door and enter very small room about 10 high and big enough to fit about six people only if they squish together there is lever built into the wall in the up position this room is actually an elevator that leads to the sublevel area 25 it is activated by depressing the lever which puts into motion series of hidden pulleys and chains magic mouth has been placed on the lever and anyone touching it activates it stop how do we know you should continue answer this question what stands perfectly still yet takes the lives of many what can have pieces broken off and not be harmed what reaches for the heavens above what is an obstacle to every traveler the correct answer is mountain if not given the correct answer stinking cloud spell is activated when the keep was nt abandoned bell also rang in the guards room gnoll room but this was broken long ago sublevel this is the bottom level of the tower area 25 keep treasury this room is where the treasury of the keep was once help flameburst took much of it for himself but there is still some left this room is very dark and the smell of stagnant water attacks your nostrils pools of the aforementioned water are everywhere and it drips down from the stone ceiling various weeds and fungi grow in the corners the floor here is cracked as if some great weight was here long ago door is in the east wall several piles of coins lie here though looking nothing like the treasure they are due to the surroundings you notice few other objects in the piles what left of the treasury is 987 gp three potions of extrahealing twohanded sword and golden circlet laced with six rubies worth 2100 gp lurking in the corner is krudd gnoll who did not want to serve thewyar with his friends when they came to the keep he made run for it and found his way down here he is terrified of thewyar flameburst and gathaur and made no attempt to call for help when the elevator accidentally was set to go back up he managed to survive off rats and bugs but is going insane he will leap onto pc screaming home home and stay with the pc until he is brought home which is forest fifty miles from here if pc makes charisma check krudd will calm down and explain what happened he ll join the party and gladly fight thewyar and his gnoll comrades but will be paralyzed in fear at the sight of either flameburst or gathaur krudd the gnoll ac mv hd hp 14 thac0 19 at dmg 28 2d4 axe al cn size xp 35 ml 11 if the pcs took the elevator here the ancient

store food and water in the event of siege flameburst ate all the food long ago but simply smashed apart the water jugs the climate has prevented them from ever evaporating the party can also enter from 21 this is an yet another large stone room but the signs of possible struggle are evident the entire floor is covered with water in which numerous plant life has taken up residence the room is very humid and moist and insects bite at your flesh thousands of shards of glass lie in the water in the back of the room are what looked like might off once been wooden shelves though they have all fallen over each other and are rotted and mosscovered door is in the north wall large part of the water in the northwestern corner is purely black as your boots touch the water sending ripples through

the floor empties it into an underground cavern where it was absorbed though sewage is long gone the odor has not left pcs smaller then and succeeding in four successful dexterity or climbing proficiency checks can enter area 30 somewhere in the drain is zombie originally an adventurer seeking treasure the adventurer was very clean elf and thewyar placed him here for irony as the elf would be doomed to be forever dirty use the stats from area the zombie carries dagger you enter this tiny room and momentarily fall to your knees from the stench it is perhaps the worst odor any of you have ever experienced in your lives and you recognize it for what it is bodily waste after your eyes stop tearing you notice the various piles of what must of been waste now whitishgray dust the stone walls are stained an odd blackish color in the middle of the ceiling is mediumsized round hole the end of metallic pipe or something in the middle of the floor directly below the pipe is rusted metal grate the entire room is slanted so as to give you the impression the grate is drain of some sort as you walk farther into the room you notice that the doorway is nt built for door but rather large metal slab which is currently raised up metal crowbar is lying next to the doorway event the ritual commences run this after the pcs explore area 25 gathaur flameburst and thewyar now begin the foul ceremony to summon tiamat from now on the aforementioned three will be located in area chanting and casting along with them is thixtwana and five of thewyar gnolls any remaining ones are assigned to guard the keep also from now on hellish chanting noises and screams can be heard coming from the top of the tower suddenly the infernal voices you heard before speak rattling the tower as they do so we hath gathered here upon this tower to commence the summoning of you the dark queen the chromatic dragon tiamat astorium kithtsorius mokerium asmodeusi malbolge dis nikari the thunderous voice of flameburst joins in my queen summon thee from thine stygian prison my queen give you mortal shell to inhabit my queen freedom shall be yours once again mis queenius doth summonis prisonis stygian the

secondincommands room but now the orc high priest thewyar dwells here if the dm wishes it so and event has not yet occurred there is 20 chance he ll be here getting ready for the summoning 1d4 gnoll guards will be outside his door you enter the room and smell like the one from downstairs is recognized though less potent the room is fairly large but whoever uses it has not or does nt need to taken advantage of the all the space there is large bed against one wall unmade and soiled window hole is in one of the walls giving you good view of the keep and it environs hanging on the wall is large metallic carving of round circle with five tubes coming out of it it is slightly rusted and there is brownish stain on it on night table next to the bed are two books on top of each other the bottom one is large about 18 inches long and obviously read often the second is much smaller leather bound book well worn as you examine that book you notice the carving is represented on the cover of the larger book pcs have the same chance to recognize the carving as symbol of tiamat as for the one in area 20 the large book is prayer book to tiamat written in orcish it is worth 500 gp to any sage simply out of interest it worth 800 gp to anyone interested in tiamat sage would want it for knowledge any worshipper of tiamat would most probably attack the holder on sight if the holder did nt worship her paladin gains 200 xp for destroying the book which adds to the evil in this world the small book is thewyar journal also in orcish after reading it the pc will realize thewyar is an orcish high priest of tiamat the chromatic dragon and feared and followed by many humanoid races the last few entries are the only ones giving vital information they are undated today is day that will be

odin the patron deity of lord battlewood and his army thewyar has made it into temple of tiamat there is 45 chance gnoll will be here praying anyone making an intelligence check will notice the words temple of odin carved above the doors you notice the door to this room has an odd symbol carved on it of large circle with five tubes growing out of it entering you are shocked the same symbol is here except in the form of tall tinted glass sculpture of crude make twelve red velvet pillows lie in rows on the stone floor directly in front of the symbol there is small fire flickering in the fireplace heating metal pot which contains bright red liquid in which is floating red object flat as piece of paper you note that above the sculpture however there are the words odin our father our guidance our sword anyone breaking the sculpture open will find five basketballsized eggs they are dragon eggs of white red black blue and green great wyrms each donated an egg to make the sculpture fairly typical to tiamat prayer sculptures each egg has had power word kill cast on it sacrificing the unborn dragons inside each is worth 6000 gp the sculpture if somehow removed is worth 9000 gp if it is somehow shown that dragon eggs are inside it is worth 15000 gp the sculpture weighs 300 pounds area 28 summoning room this was originally guest room it was used to summon gathaur any wizard making wisdom check recognizes that powerful summoning spell was cast here if his wisdom is above 16 no check is needed your hearts skip beat when you enter this room single torch casts flickering light upon it the walls are covered in blue runes top to bottom floor and ceiling in the center is large pile of skulls from various creatures you can make out ones belonging to minotaurs gnolls umber hulks trolls dwarves humans and even hill giant good number of them have been crushed as if stepped on and the ones on top like some of the floor are severely charred burnt scraps of paper lie in flutter around the room bloodstains are horrifying apparent on some of the walls and several skulls any good pcs feel headache in this room it goes away once they leave and is result of the temporary connection with the nine hells that was here and the leftover evil residue still sticks to the walls area 29 stairway this leads to area 30 level three this is the last floor of the tower and where tiamat will be summoned area 30 the dark ritual this was originally lord battlewood chambers lavatory and office the walls were long ago destroyed along with the ceiling gathaur has been dwelling here for the past few days preparing the summoning mixing ingredients and plotting the pit fiend plans for tiamat to arrive using thixtwana as her avatar he also plans to kill flameburst soon as he is angry for being controlled by him in the first place after tiamat takes her avatar and begins rampaging he will plane shift back to the nine hells if pc sneaks up here before the summoning has started by way of the pipe in area 25 the pc will get one surprise attack gathaur will then quickly slay the pc assuming its just another mettlesome looter and continue if the pcs come up by way of stairs he will attack but first taking time to call flameburst who will arrive in 1d6 rounds if at the keep 2d10 if elsewhere if pc interrupts once the ceremony has started the gnolls all of whom will be present will attack along with flameburst the following is the description for the room the first is before the ritual starts the second after this was probably once large series of rooms but now nothing then the top of the tower the walls have been shattered all now at different heights the tallest section is only ten feet high the entire room is circular about fifty feet in diameter you have wonderful view for miles around but something takes away any enjoyment you get from it sitting with it back to you legs crossed is 12 monstrosity it has two huge black wings growing from its back along with long red warty tail slowly swinging from behind it it body is fiery red more so then flameburst and tiny scales pervert the reflecting light into reddish beam though you ca nt see it assuredly horrid face something vile and green is dripping onto the floor in front of it the thing is apparently reading what looks like an enormous book it pages made of black metal with silver scribing and each page about long thousands of white candles unlit surround it 10 granite sculpture of fiveheaded dragon is next to your opposing wall the walls are covered in blue runes you hear the thing slowly mumbling under it breath and by it terrible voice you relive that it was making the multivoiced noises from before use the basic room description as above destroying any peace of mind you may of had are the things you see here the most apparent is 12 monstrosity holding large long metallic book with black pages and white scribing it is an atrocious baneful menacing thing with hellish red skin covered with thousands of tiny fetid scales long atrocious tail drags along the floor and two long black ghastly wings protrude from it back it is drunkenly hobbling around the 20 raging fire in the center of the area chanting unutterable words in it abysmal multi sounding voice then there is flameburst standing on his hind legs near the sculpture uttering words in some unknown language his loathsome eyes look glazed over as he peers into the huge fire then there is fairly tall hideouslooking orc wearing long red robe with black specks across it he is waving his arms up in down almost worshipping the fire several gnolls each wearing white robe with red specks all stand guard along the walls each obviously terrified at the unholy goingson next to the billowing flame is large 10 tall marble slab tied to it is thixtwana naked his body is covered in bluish runes he is frantically trying to break free though it futile the battle note that thewyar and the gnoll armor classes are currently 10 due to the robes each gnoll has 50 chance of noticing the pcs in which case he ll immediately shout so and attack they are scared enough of the consequences to fight to the death flameburst will also attack right away as he is not crucial to the actual summoning though he wants to make good impression on his queen when she appears he will make sure thewyar and thixtwana are not hurt and that the bonfire is not put out gathaur will attempt to continue with the ceremony as long as he can thewyar will simply chant and conduct the ceremony as he is one who will actually bring her into this world gathaur simply helps to bring her to the point of entering our world thixtwana will scream to be released as he knows darn well what his purpose is if released he will attempt to escape down the stairs if blocked he will give up and commit suicide leaping off the tower the summoning the entire purpose of this ritual is to summon tiamat the chromatic dragon so that she can rampage and cause unknowable death and destruction to the world it takes 20 rounds to summon tiamat every round they are interrupted they lose that round of chanting and must redo it in addition to the next round use the following chart to keep track round round round 11 round 16 round round round 12 round 17 round round round 13 round 18 round round round 14 round 19 round round 10 round 15 round 20 unless the pcs take especially long rounds will of been completed by the time they come up here at the end of the 20th round thewyar will fall to his knees and the fire will suddenly turn whitehot reaching hundreds of feet into the sky read the following suddenly the chanting reaches an enormous climax the fire turns whitehot and shoots up hundreds of feet into the air but you can see something inside the fire the middle of it gives you vision of another place you see long seemingly endless plain of cracked and dusty ground then on the horizon something slowly appears and walks towards you it is dragon fiveheaded dragon each representing different color and each with it own corrupt grin of triumph and it coming closer over the image of the dragon you see the face of woman the most beautiful woman you ve ever seen she has deep black hair and eyes and black lips there is wry smile on her lips she holds out her arms and the nails are also black she and the dragonheads speak at the same time creating vile obscene sound that makes you unconsciously quiver mesmerized by the diabolical power before you complete the ritual flameburst immediately swoops next to the fire and bows down the dragon looking horribly human for moment my queen gathaur lets out dreadful malevolent laugh raising his bloated arms in pleasure thewyar begins an abominable dance pointing to thixtwana and the fire loudly chanting if thewyar is not stopped thixtwana and the stone slab will explode in one round and tiamat will be in it place her sheer weight will destroy the tower and she will first slay thewyar the gnolls and gathaur then the pcs flameburst will act as her page announcing the chromatic one has come to the world time of great death and destruction will follow make it apparent thewyar is the key to the summoning if he is stopped read the following as thewyar is at the end of his chant dousing thixtwana in strange liquid you hit killpunchwhatever him and he falls into the flames shrieking the woman face contorts her perfect teeth grow yellow additional fiery eyes appear on her face and she melds into the dragon behind her it screams no no not again you have failed me you have all failed me nooooooo one of the woman arms actually reaches out of the fire it is at least fifteen feet thick but transparent it grasps thixtwana rather it would but it apparently uncorporeal too nonetheless thixtwana lets out scream scream filled of more pain then you can ever imagine then the stone slab suddenly explodes in blast of flame sending thixtwana halfway across the area slamming into wall gathaur leaps into the air landing in front of the wavering fire and shattering part of the stone floor in the process wait he says calmly in voice filled with evil he raises deformed arm and simply points at flameburst who looks evilly at him saadir flameburst face suddenly turns to one of shock the woman raises an eyebrow slightly her face still furious saadir you will be judged flameburst begins to fly off gathaur why did you suddenly thousand tiny eyeballs encircle the dragon they disappear as soon as they came unworthy flameburst lets out childish yelp and is enveloped in black light his body rockets forward landing with thunderclap onto the ground below he is still the flame goes out in flash and the last thing you see is the fiveheaded dragon smiling oddly then it is gone leaving only the smoking skulls the fire was set upon and thewyar charred body gathaur lets out hideous bellow have other plans tiamat is not crucial to the ways of baatezu she can stay in her prison for all care he will then slay any remaining gnolls and attack the pcs for one more round chuckling the whole time he does this simply for sport the next round he steps backward and with slight bow and smile says you narrowly averted your destruction mortals there is no point in my being here any longer rest assured the blood war will have the baatezu as it victors remember that remember in the cold dark hours of the night in another world my people may of one an eternal war war in which the victors will be able to freely come here think of it as dog begins barking at something outside it folds it arms across it chest and disappears in sudden burst of fire the smell of brimstone hangs in the air and the stone is charred where he once stood gathaur has plane shifted back home but all isnt over tiamat managed to leave some of her essence in thixtwana body she gets up surrounded by bluewhite light and attacks the pcs with everything she has if the body is destroyed there is bluewhite explosion and it falls dead tiamat avatar ac mv 16 hp 90 thac0 at dmg 212 str bonus see below str see below con 17 dex 18 int 24 wis 24 cha sa spells possession see below sd 45 mr saves as

fraction of tiamat power if slain it will not rise again nor will tiamat actually be killed the avatar starts off with 1800 strength every rounds it grows feet and gains point of strength with maximum of 25 as it grows it becomes increasingly more dragonlike but will not actually become dragon in addition tiamat can attempt to possess pcs body to do so she must make successful attack roll though it wo nt cause damage then there is 65 chance shell succeed minus for every level of the intended victim if successful the victim dies hisher soul destroyed preventing any possibility of raising the new avatar will have all the powers of the old though spells are not renewed it will have the body hit points plus an additional 2d10 more in addition no matter what avatar she has it will slowly deteriorate after it operates for 30 rounds it starts losing 1d3 points off every ability score every round when something hits zero the avatar dies thus tiamats avatar will be in constant need of fresh bodies for possession if it somehow escapes the avatar will roam the countryside causing as much death and destruction as possible selecting new body and so on it will probably be stopped within week by an elite unit of soldiers or possibly some adventurers even if it not it will gradually fade in power and can not exist more than month aftermath the pcs will no doubt want to rest up and heal after the battle there will be no encounters whatsoever for the next two days as everyone and thing is scared to death that something evil still dwells at the keep although not apparent during the battle there are some things of note here carved into wall is the following to any follower of lord battlewood we are three of his most devoted followers and have managed to sneak up here to write this message know that after we survived the dragon and fiends attack we took lord battlewood body and with the help of uiaar his mage we are building great tomb for him we can not reveal the location but suffice that it is close enough to this keep be wary it will be protected from those who would do harm therefore various clues have been left in the the message was burned in the battle this is an adventure hook no doubt any pcs looking for riches would be eager to get any treasures buried with kyarr the metallic book used by gathaur is from the nine hells written by powerful being there who discovered how to summon tiamat the only way pcs can understand its contents is by asking baatezu or one versed in their languages these people are few and far between if not unique as it is 100 magic resistant any baatezu presented with it would most likely kill the person who had it and then return it in hopes of promotion paladin who destroys the book gains 800 xp for ridding the world of it it is metallic however and only great heat would destroy it in addition any good person touching it takes 3d6 points of damage and is feebleminded for 1d10 rounds any neutral is simply feebleminded and an evil person may touch it the book weighs five hundred pounds and is worth 9000 gp though only someone evil and knowledgeable in what it is would buy it someone of different alignment might but for totally different reason or the would nt take the risk of possibly touching it the statue of tiamat is worth 5000 gp also there is flameburst corpse to consider pcs can try making armor out of it selling it it worth about 20000 gp to the right buyer getting spell components from it or even cooking and eating it also after while nearby people especially the townsfolk of turen will sense the vanquished evil large band of them hundred or more will come up to the keep once they see that the pcs are indeed heroes no doubt they will be adequately rewarded the pcs may even want to stay and

case she ever came to this world to kill also very charismatic he led his fellow orcs to capture travelers and interrogate him he slowly learned about her and became shaman devoted to her tiamat was amused at this and out of sheer whim decided to allow him to worship her letting him grow in power and knowledge thewyar became very powerful shaman he thinks he highpriest and was greatly feared and respected by all humanoids near him one day flameburst who was searching for someone knowledgeable in the ritual to summon tiamat learned of thewyar by sheer chance he landed in an orc village for quick snack and saw tiamat symbol on everyone thewyar knew of the ritual as tiamat saw him growing in power and taught it to him in hopes she one day be summoned to again ravage the world thewyar has been living at the keep the last few weeks preparing for the spell out of boredom he been creating zombies from killed explorers and putting them in places that are horrible to spend all of eternity thewyar is never without the gnolls he brought with him to the keep they serve him faithfully and will fight to the death there are ten in all and 1d8 are always with him thewyar acts egotistic around most people since he is the highpriest of tiamat after all he is fairly sure of his power but she would nt mind if he got killed by kobold if he was nt the key to her freedom therefore thewyar will
