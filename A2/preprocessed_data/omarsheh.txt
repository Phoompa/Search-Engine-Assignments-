prince omar and princess sheherazade once upon time on the island of kaledan lived king who was famous all over the east wellloved by his subjects and respected even by his enemies in spite of having good and beautiful wife his life was not always happy after years of marriage they had no children and were afraid they would never know the joy of family however at long last one splendid spring morning handsome baby boy was born and his delighted parents called him omar in the language of kaledan this means shining light the years went by and omar grew into finelooking youth brave intelligent and kindhearted on his eighteenth birthday the king sent for his son omar now that you ve come of age you must find wife choose one of the many princesses you ve met and whose only dream is of marrying you father said omar respectfully ve no intention of getting married still young and rather wait till the time is ripe want to think about it for at least another year the king agreed and omar spent the year studying with the wisest and cleverest teachers in the kingdom and though he got to know number of girls he did not fall in love when twelve months had passed the young prince was again summoned to his father well son said the king anxiously when am to announce your engagement alas father still have nt met the right girl was omar reply the king lost his temper omar you must stop wasting time you re grown man now and want to see your heirs think of the future and make up your mind without delay sorry father ca nt do that just yet not in love and so ca nt get married the king who could not bear to be crossed in such an important matter went into rage he shouted for the guards and ordered them to shut the prince in an old castle in the forest in the meanwhile lovely sweetnatured princess sheherazade was maiden whose home was in china when she became sixteen years old her father insisted she marry one of the princes that flocked to court her but sheherazade was waiting to meet true love and since nothing the king her father did served to change her mind he locked the princess up in one of the palaces rather be prisoner said the princess than have husband didnt love meantime omar spent lonely sad days in the castle where he was held prisoner however two invisible genies abhu and dhabi were amusing themselves unknown to the prince by secretly watching his movements one day abhu said to his friend omar is the most handsome person in the whole world not so exclaimed dhabi the most beautiful person in the world is sheherazade the king of china daughter the genies started to argue then decided to ask lilibeth the daughter of the genie king to judge the matter lilibeth advice was this go to china cast sleeping spell over the princess and bring her to omar castle when you see them together then you ll soon see which is the most beautiful that very night abhu and dhabi flew all the way to china the two genies sent the princess to sleep and carried her to omar castle they re so lovely they seem made for each other remarked the genies gazing at the two young people together if only they could get to know each other and in the hope that they might the genies hid behind curtain and waited not long afterwards sheherazade opened her eyes and when she saw omar at her side her heart began to thump this was the man she would like to marry so she took off one of her rings and slipped it on to his finger as token of love then she went back to sleep on wakening little later omar set eyes on sheherazade and was overwhelmed by her beauty if this girl is as kind as she beautiful she would make wonderful wife said omar to himself as he gazed at her in amazement then he took off ruby ring and slipped it onto the princess finger drowsy again he fell asleep abhu and dhabi crept out from behind the curtain wideeyed they ve fallen in love said dhabi what are we to do now take sheherazde home again but if they have really fallen in love they ll move heaven and earth to meet again and so when omar awoke sheherazade had vanished confused and upset the prince asked his guards and servants if they had seen her when the king heard the story he told omar my lad you are losing your head over girl you dreamed about no she was nt dream the prince insisted this is the ring she left me omar was lovesick the king called doctors and wise men but there was nothing they could do for omar was losing his will to live and far away sheherazade was pining in sorrow the king was certain his daughter must have dreamt it all how otherwise could she have met the mysterious young man the only person who believed the princess was marzuan childhood friend and he offered to search for the missing youth sheherazade handed him omar ruby ring marzuan set out that same day but though he travelled far and wide noone could give him clue as to the young man identity in the meantime abhu and dhabi secretly followed in his tracks one day merchant told marzuan that on the island of kaledan there was lovesick prince feeling that this might be the very person he was seeking marzuan took passage on ship bound for kaledan after days of sailing terrible storm broke driving the ship onto reef where it sank clinging to floating spar marzuan held on till the storm died away then headed for the shore the beach was deserted but in the
