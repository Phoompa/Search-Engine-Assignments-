the musicians of bremen once upon time an old donkey was illtreated by his master tired of such unkindness he decided to run away and when he heard that bremen was looking for singers with the town band he decided that someone with fine braying voice like his might be accepted as he went along the road the donkey met skinny dog covered with sores come with me if you have good bark you ll find job with the band too just wait and see little later stray cat no longer able to catch mice joined them and the trio trotted hopefully on towards the town as they passed farmyard they stopped to admire an elderly cockerel who with outstretched wings was crowing to the skies you sing well they told him what are you so happy about happy muttered the cockerel with tears in his eyes they want to put me in the pot and make broth of me singing as hard as can today for tomorrow ll be gone but the donkey told him run away with us with voice like yours you ll be famous in bremen now there were four of them the way was long night fell and very frightened the four creatures found themselves in thick forest they scarcely knew whether to press on or to hide in some caves and rest suddenly in the distance they saw light amongst the trees it came from little cottage and they crept up to the window the donkey placed his front hoofs on the window ledge anxious to see the dog jumped on the donkey back the cat climbed onto the dog and the cockerel flew on top of the cat to watch what was going on inside now the cottage was the hideaway of gang of bandits who were busily celebrating their latest robbery the hungry donkey and his friends became excited when they saw the food on the table upset by the jittery crew on his back the donkey stuck his head through the window and toppled his three companions on to the lamp the light went out and the room rang with the braying of the donkey who had cut his nose on the glass the barking of the dog and the snarling of the cat the cockerel screeched along with the others taken completely by surprise the terrified bandits fled screaming the devil the devil and their abandoned meal ended up in the four friends stomachs later however just as the donkey and his companions were dropping off to sleep one of the bandits crept back to the now quiet house and went in to find out what had taken place he opened the door and with his pistol in his hand he stepped trembling towards the fire however mistaking the glow of the cat eyes for burning coals he thrust candle between them and instantly the furious cat sank its claws into the bandit face the man fell backwards on to the dog dropping his gun which went off and the animal sharp teeth sank into his leg when the donkey saw the bandit figure at the door he gave tremendous kick sending the man flying right through the doorway the cockerel greeted this feat with grim crowing sound run screamed the bandit run horrible witch in there scratched my face demon bit me on the leg and monster beat me with stick and but the other bandits were no longer listening for they had taken to their heels and fled and so the donkey the dog the cat and the cockerel took over the house without any trouble and with the booty left behind by the bandits always had food on the table and lived happy and contented for many years
