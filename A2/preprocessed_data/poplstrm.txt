the poplar and the stream once upon time woodcutter called ivan lived ln huge forest in the north of russia sturdy young man with his bare hands he built himself stout log cabin and when it was finished he thought he would look for wife his dream was of beautiful maiden tall slender and fair with blue eyes and creamy skin on sundays he roamed to distant villages looking for the girl of his dreams but the only girls he ever saw were dull and not pretty enough as it so happened the path he took to work passed close to pretty little house with green shutters often the corner of curtain would be raised and sweetfaced girl would watch the woodcutter as he went by for he had unwittingly lit the flames of love in maiden heart this young girl alled natasha she was very shy but her love for the woodcutter was so great that one day she plucked up enough courage to stop him on the path picked this basket of strawberries myself she said please eat them and think of me well she not exactly ugly said ivan to himself as he stared woodenly at natasha who was blushing to the roots of her hair do nt like strawberries he replied bluntly but thanks all the same tears sprang to natasha eyes as she watched him stride away few days later the girl again stopped ivan and held out woolen jacket saying the air will be chilly tonight when you go home this will keep you warm made it myself but ivan coldly replied what makes you think that man like me is afraid of the cold and this time at ivan refusal two tears rolled down natasha rosy cheeks and she fled sobbing into the house however natasha again watched for the woodcutter this time she held out bottle and said you can refuse liqueur that distilled from all the fruits of the forest it will but ivan broke in saying do nt like liqueurs and marched straight on however he realized he had been very rude so he turned round but natasha had gone as he walked he said to himself she has gentle eyes and she must be very kindhearted perhaps should take at least one of her gifts but the picture of his dream girl slipped into his mind so unhappy he sighed at that very moment on golden cloud appeared beautiful lady will you sing song for me rosalka one of the woodland fairies ivan stood thunderstruck sing for you for the rest of my life he exclaimed if only could and he stretched out his hand to touch the fairy but she floated out of reach amongst the branches sing then sing only the sound of your voice will ever send me to sleep so ivan happily sang all the old lullabies and love songs while the drowsy fairy urged him on sing sing cold and weary his voice getting hoarser the woodcutter sang till evening as he tried to help the fairy to fall asleep but when night fell rosalka was still demanding if you love me sing on sing as the woodcutter sang on in feeble voice he kept thinking wish had jacket to keep me warm suddenly he remembered natasha what fool am he told himself should have chosen her as my bride not this woman who asks and gives nothing in return ivan felt that only the gentlefaced natasha could fill his empty heart he fled into the darkness but he heard cruel voice call you ll never see her again all her tears for her great love have turned her into stream you ll never see her again it was dawn when ivan knocked at natasha door no one answered and the woodcutter saw with fear that close by flowed tiny sparkling stream he had never noticed before weeping sorrowfully he plunged his face into the water oh natasha how could have been so blind and love you now lifting his gaze to the sky he silently said prayer let me stay beside her forever ivan was magically turned into young poplar tree and the stream bathed its roots natasha had at last her beloved ivan by her side for ever
