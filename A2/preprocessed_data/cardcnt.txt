from ats5 internet01comppgecom thu aug 150701 1994 date wed aug 94 222501 pdt from andy smith ats5 internet01comppgecom subject accounting for the cards by valimaa accounting for the cards valimaa graphic art by rourke does nt anyone read anymore grumbled mary as she logged off the net one week 32 newsgroups and shitload of email after posting her questions and she was no closer to an answer there was rapping on her door yeah sheriff obequot is here to see you ll be there in minute she stood up hiked down her navy wool skirt and shrugged into the matching suit jacket the silver raven necklace was mary only ojibiwa accoutrement an odd contrast to her navy pumps and short bobbed hair she picked up the ledgers for the oec ojibiwa entertainment corporation containing hardcopy of the casino financial accounts the figures showed the tribe primary income fairly significant figure the amount in the ledgers unfortunately did not jibe with the amount in the bank records as the oec accountant mary found this unsettling another knock disrupted her thoughts shut off the tetris mary do nt have all day for this she opened the door and stood eyeball to eyeball with hank obequot marquette county sheriff father and chief pain in her butt he took in her clothing and raised an eyebrow the motion encapsulated threeyearold argument just cause cpas are money smart and clothes foolish you got ta copy everything she smiled tightly at him you want people to treat you like professional you have to look like one to them do nt see you trading in your sheriff uniform for buckskins sometimes words were redundant please have seat sheriff keep it official mary thought she gestured to an old armchair squeezed between her desk and brickandboard bookcase he lowered his stocky frame into it his eyebrow remained raised as she continued need to report robbery the other brow joined the first someone lift your truck tape player someone lifted 12000 from the oec he frowned hank obequot had set up the security system for the casino grumbling all the while keeping employment within the tribe kept inhouse pilfering lowtononexistent and lots of very attentive inhouse workers usually kept the customers from walking off with anything but their legit winnings nothings stirring out there not holdup right embezzlement figures out of whack accountant she nodded well if the november one statement was that far off why you wait two weeks to call me dammit mary anyone grabbed 12000 could be in brazil by now the november statement was fine she said wearily look at the books if you want they balance to the penny but the bank has set up the accounts so can download them and check them daytoday actually the bank had done that quite while ago but janine had just shown her how to access them this month when the money go missing it seemed to start around november it gone at about fifteen hundred day minus sundays at first figured there was some electronic lag and let it go few days then figured my books were off had tom from mcgraw and hudson check them out she ran her hands through her hair he was thorough dad he ran friggin audit and there is nothing wrong with the books he offered me job but no ideas on where the money went you called in an outside accountant firm yeah hell only had time and funds for two years at northern ve started up with few classes this fall now that we ve got money for more floor staff but theres still lot that do nt know so yes asked tom she started to pace also asked my advisor at northern for possible explanation asked couple of grad students in the department asked couple million faceless souls on the internet she grimaced got lots of info from that last one tribal gambling is corrupt tribal gambling is blow for native americans against the anglos accountants are corrupt her dad grinned she continued money is polluting our wayoflife native americans can bet on the redskins in the superbowl in good conscience if they declare it on their taxes from there they started to go off the subject she paused for breath what it comes down to is that fifteen hundred dollars night has gone missing these past ten days no customers marks he inserted have been in that regularly and do nt see how they could lift that kind of money past our security it not the marks its not the books who is it one of the employees or the bank perhaps but do nt think anyone at the bank would be that clumsy if they were gon na take that kind of money they hit big company the copper mines one of the fisheries hell northern university we all use northwestern union the oec is nt the kind of company where you can hide this kind of discrepancy if someone was gon na grab the money and run they would nt much care about figure juggling could be they re hitting all the places you ve mentioned could be any number of things so check both the bank the casino workers hell check the local squirrels maybe they re sneaking hundreddollar bills from the courier bag for their nests just want the oec money back he stood up ll put deputy lahti on it at her frown he held up his hands hey now mary this ai nt the only crime committed around here not by long shot ive had two drug busts hitandrun and three and since went on shift this afternoon busier day than used to have before this gambling palace opened he added pointedly guess folks have something worth breaking and entering for now he shut the door firmly behind him mary buried her head in her hands and studied the desk oak scratched polyeurothaned nice grain unhelpful should come back janine jagegiwaya no it was quick raven these days thanks to heritage kick slouched against the door she wore an armydrab jacket over leather vest and blue jeans at sixteen she could still hope that the next couple of years would make the vest more interesting god is it 730 already the buzzing from the main casino room was getting louder she thought it was just her head umhmm ve got program to finish for class next monday you kay ve been better mary moved away from the desk as quick raven ambled over the only things speedy about the kid were her fingers and her mind she was in remedial classes through fifth grade because she did nt open her mouth in class after her standardized test scores came in some sheepish administrators booted her into the giftedtalented track she was spending her senior year at the community college she gotten mary through her first hairy encounters with lotus and great plains accounting software janine got kick out of the name introduced her to internet shown her how to download the bank record say janine the girl typed bit more paused typed again tapped the enter key few times ok quick raven then quick raven looked up and grinned did you mention the computer bank access to anyone nah so no one here knows seeing the figures before december one probly not quick raven turned back to the screen no wonder no one had legged it they figured they had two more weeks and over 15000 more before she catch on she felt her stomach knot no one at the bank would assume that she was probably the last accountant in marquette michigan to rely on snail mail for her figures it had to be someone here oh shit she grumbled and left janine to terminex her homework mary walked past the kitchen into the main room of the casino the public part of the casino was situated in three rooms all decorated in the logcabingonebaroque style made popular by maurice mennifield on northern exposure the tribe had gotten someone grandmother attic full of victorianugly furniture and someone else greatuncle supply of old rifles now honorably retired to the wall racks few blankets added color to the walls and doubled as noise dampeners the green felt on the tables glowed in the light of the oil lamps authentic sea lanterns that had been wired and now swayed above waves of tourists against the west wall was bar and couple of rows of tables mary watched tray of roast beef sandwiches being carried toward them the aroma made her entire body sway when had she missed lunch few hours after skipping breakfast she snagged table and flagged down the next waitress ask chuck to send out the quickest thing on the grill wouldja andrea bout time you got out here mary we were about to drag you out of that office behind snowmobile andrea grinned and swayed towards the kitchen her highheeled lavender shoes exaggerating her naturally bouncy gait she had lot of what quick raven vest lacked and several customers watched her with warm eyes wonder where she got those new pumps mused mary enviously thought struck her andrea had access to the money pouch heck maybe everyone here could find way to get at it for two or three minutes night how long would it take to lift fifteen hundred dollars no if any of the waits or croupiers were going into her office every night one of the guards would have noticed still the room wasnt exactly hermetically sealed she never thought it would need to be internal security at the casino was based on the concept naive perhaps that no one would steal from himself the casino was tribally owned and staffed the workers were paid not wonderfully mary only made 19000 year but decently compared to tribal average well below the poverty line more importantly the profits went to the tribe they paid for education and training for better jobs the michigan ojibiwa reservation now had two electricians and plumber four native teachers were in the elementary school which met in four rooms out of new nineroom school building and several high school teachers doctor and two lawyers were enroute janine was sure to bring computer engineering degree into the tribe soon now kids at school talked about becoming engineers and cops rangers and dentists not waitresses injun tour guides and subsistence farmers most importantly they talked about doing it here not in detroit or milwaukee whoever was siphoning off the money from the oec accounts was stealing their future mary did nt really want to know who do that but she had to find out her interview with deputy issac lahti did nt satisfy either one of them how many people have access to the money he asked incredulously running his hands through his cropped red hair twentyone or so he just looked at her for long minute well there me she said and the dealers twelve of them and the person who collects the tables winnings every hour or so and the six guys who guard the back rooms and the courier pouch and the courier oh and the cashier has access in case she needs extra for some big winner or something so that twentytwo sure no one else the sixth grade class is nt allowed to use it for their monopoly games sarcastic finns added so much to mary day we ve never had trouble with pilferage before she said defensively how can you tell look the cashier and count the money every evening it goes in locked bag to the bank night deposit with two big wellarmed guards escorting the courier the bank figures and my figures have always matched before now croupier might be skimming at the table but that would nt account for the discrepancies between my count and the bank not exactly reassuring idea that would narrow it down to you the cashier the courier and the guards susan matchigisig the cashier rarely goes back to the office where we keep the money we do nt have that many really big winners do nt remember one in the past few weeks some fun casino he snorted it business ok what are the names of the others the courier is selene omashinaway but ca nt see her doing anything like this would you ve made her courier if you could what about the guards ve got six guys who rotate two nights week it usually 300 am before the money ready to go and no one wants to guard it six nights running she listed the names hesitating bit at naming her cousins matt and simon kishketawa she added quickly its every night you know the stealing if the guards are in on it they re all in on it and do nt see that matt and tyron another guard couldnt agree that snow was cold much less go in on heist together they hate each other with pure unsullied spite ll keep that in mind he sounded unconvinced now let go over the money collection procedure one more time to see if we ve missed anyone it was more like six times before he closed his notebook and said ok where can find matt kishketawa what you re gon na question him nah thought ask him to the prom but what if you spook him her whoever he looked at her quizzically look no one on the reservation knows the money missing but you me and dad and the crook most folks know barely semicomputer literate and conservative as hell when it comes to accounting procedures even if they knew daytoday records were available which most of them wo nt they ll be sure neither know about them nor use them it had taken janine the better part of month to get her to try it if word gets out that you re asking about missing 12000 the crook sure to run and we ll never see the money again uhhuh so you want me to investigate robbery without letting anyone know it exists sounds fun he looked glum but he did nt argue with her logic so why am gon na be here and nosy oh do nt know you could play blackjack the chief would have six fits he not too enthused about this whole operation you know know believe me know he made it really clear that we should nt endorse it figures could be like here because interested in one of the workers romanticlike he looked nonchalantly at his closed notebook you maybe it would explain why we be going off to discuss things his windburned face grew slightly redder it would nt explain why you were spending hours asking odd questions around the casino she looked quizzically at him what kind of detective novels did deputy lahti read in his off hours was she supposed to end up clasped to his chest while he shot it out with the bad guys not in this novel she told herself novels the purloined letter she said investigate something else what oh yeah tax fraud crooked tables money laundering get away from the money angle she inserted something removed from robbery and embezzlement might not spook em drugs then yeah drugs are believable fashionable even everyone being investigated for drug stuff we ll be right up there with the mayor of dc she felt giddy finally they were gon na get somewhere they had plan two days later she felt less pleased onequarter kilo of cocaine third of sheet of lsd and whole field of marijuana deputy lahti was reading laundry list of drugs found in his investigation so far dammit lahti you re supposed to be finding money the drug investigation is just cover remember obequot if someone practically draws me map to field of pot gon na check it out cop remember what am supposed to tell people sure im investigating drugs but really do nt have time to look at those funny cigarettes the guys are smoking outside the casino kitchen door he looked exasperated what bothers me is the cocaine lsd is nt that expensive anyone could get third of sheet at northern frat party for smile and pot real cheap especially if you grow your own but where the hell did these guys get the money for cocaine quarter kilo costs serious bucks he found the sheet and the cocaine when hed investigated the madosh brothers trailer after busting them for the pot they been relaxing after shift in the kitchen and when he tried to arrest them had run straight to their place in the woods this is your escape on drugs their marijuana field identifiable even in november was less than quarter of mile from their trailer and had shack full of gardening tools next to it with their fingerprints all over them apparently they were good farmers if lousy criminals could the 12000 have gone to buy cocaine mary groaned at the thought of year tuition going up some idiot nose suppose it could have but they re in the kitchen how would they get to the money are they related to the guards oh everyone related to everyone else to some degree they might have been second cousins to guard or two but nothing close that can think of she tried to probe the twisted genealogies of the tribe dad would know somehow it does nt seem right for one thing 12000 would buy four times the coke we found and they did nt have the noses of people who done that kind of coke in two weeks have they been acting really up aggressive wired no they tended to be more hazy she shrugged more like potheads guess can maybe see them trying lsd but coke does nt really compute does it she shook her head maybe they re selling it to someone on the reservation does anyone around here make enough for serious coke habit no but there the casino lots of people with money to lose or spend come through the door every night looks like we have another investigation on our hands he smiled your casino is good for business at least for my department screw you lahti while you ve been playing with our teenage drug lords another 3000 has gone missing now it might not seem like much compared to busting up coke ring but that pc for our middle school or new set of science books or maybe dental work for some of the kids ok ok he held up his hands point made and taken maybe if lean on them about their supplier it ll lead me to someone involved with your money drugs and money are like bees and honey and its as much of lead as ve got right now no one else is showing signs of new wealth he yawned casino hours were new to him and headed out mary went back to her office her sanctum sanctorum where deputies feared to tread as sanctums went it was bit on the shabby side aside from the computer the chair behind her desk was the only thing that had nt been scavenged from junk shops or construction sites the chair lower back support and adjustable seat angles might keep her from secretary stoop the back problems inherent in hunching over keyboards and ledgers for hours on end but then if she set it at the odd angle janine currently had it in maybe having your feet higher than your head aided thinking she might end up with some new and extraordinary back ailment one that some chiropractor could get grant to study quick raven how it going janine made soso motion with one hand while typing with the other mary thought for moment if anyone could keep her mouth shut it was janine got question could we keep this between you and me this received look nod and grin where would you hide 15000 janine looked thoughtful who from good question me the police everyone else around here guess hmmm how long maybe month heck put it in the bank you re kidding nah there no building on the reservation that half dozen people are nt in and out of bury it and someone ll wonder who been digging find it and make off with it takes court order for cops to see your bank account you could bog that down for month easy could nt they access it on the computer like do the oec account not legally and they probably need the codes to get to the account pin number and social security number which the bank would nt give without court order could nt give it unless they wanted to get sued probably need codes definitely if they wanted it legal what if they did nt janine looked at her quizzically this ai nt rhetorical hell no mary hesitated 1500 day yeah it looked like enough to hush her own scruples it was nice to know your own price let me get you some ss numbers she went to file drawer and pulled employee records plopping them on the desk she said do nt have pin numbers will that be problem for you pends on what mary moved janine dr pepper and perched on the edge of the desk on what you re trying to do here didja watch sneakers one time too many you think all computer geeks are mad hackers that ca nt wait to start breaking into things saw you ream out danny mukwada once for parking in handicapped space now you want me to break into bank shit mary always been rather proud of her own moral code she had nt realized what pain scruples could be in others ok it like this lahti would have something really sarcastic to say to her right now we re being robbed like nice of you not to tell anyone of about 1500 night ca nt let anyone know ive got ta find out who it is it might spook em shut up lahti she thought fif teen hundred dollars you know what could do with that no and probably would nt understand if you told me can you get into the records sure the ss numbers ll help who do you want checked mary looked though the records and pulled out people on her hot list the guards the courier the cashier and herself janine looked at the last one and cocked loaded eyebrow at her hey it seems fair and ve got access to the money and my scruples are waving one last time before going under fucking polly pureheart muttered janine she logged off of something mary thought she recognized net prompt and started typing two hours and four dr peppers for janine later mary was far wiser person she knew one of the guards was overdrawn and had better deposit this week paycheck fast susan the cashier had made payments to major televangelist on her northwestern union visa card her cousin simon had bought with his nu visa 24675 of merchandise from gay and lesbian shop on front street and janine apparently had stainless steel bladder janine popped open another soda guess bankers do nt need soap operas they can check out bank cards no kidding ll never look at susan the same way again she checked the sheet ok omashinaway selene 366728225 let see what the courier carrying rightyo no credit card savings 046 checking shit mary looked over her shoulder selene had 1803675 in her checking account is this the same selene who had her chevy repossessed eight months ago asked janine the very same it was also the same selene who mom had married the madosh brothers dad about ten years ago what with the name difference the relationship had nt really clicked for mary she picked up the phone to call her dad halfway through dialing she realized it was lahti number her fingers were punching mary janine glared at her mary remembered that the modem and phone were on the same line and shrugged halfhearted apology they did nt need any more from the bank tonight the phone rang about seven times whaddaya mean you ve noticed evidence that she the crook lahti asked irritably they woken him up from sound sleep at oh it was only 150 am barely past suppertime for mary where this evidence ca nt really show it to you let just say found out she has way more money than she should ca nt you just take it as an anonymous tip getting search warrant takes more than an anonymous tip especially if youre asking me to wake up judge at this time of night to get it most know would probably throw me into jail for being an infernal nuisance must be nice to be judge he added rather wistfully but they do nt get to strip search she felt her face grow warm and hurried on selene is going to go out in one of the guard cars tonight ll make sure its one of my cousins the pouch is oec propery giving you permission to open it if you re at the bank in an hour and fifteen minutes you could catch her right after tonight deposit but we ve got ta move soon the bank statement coming in next week and everyone knows it if you re wrong everyone will know what we re investigating if right it wo nt matter did you know that she the madosh brothers halfsister no he paused mary waited for him to bitch about her not mentioning it sooner but he let it pass ll pick you up from the casino in forty minutes ll need you there to open the pouch an hour later mary had her first taste of genuwine police stakeout she and deputy lahti sat in his brother anonymouslooking honda in an alley kittycorner from the northwestern union bank and trust the november wind prowled off lake superior down marquette streets and through the floorboards of the civic the engine was off of course the temperature was rapidly dropping of course and mary pumps had been designed for centrally heated office she had nt had time to change them of course she had to spend her forty minutes counting out money with selene while trying to act like nothing was unusual it seemed like every few minutes she find herself looking at selene hands instead of at the money she was just glad that lahti could nt get pulled for speeding or they have never made it here before matt she heard an engine and saw an old vw jetta turn into the bank parking lot thats matt car she whispered know ve given him four speeding tickets in it they watched and waited as selene went up to the night deposit took the money bag out of her courier pouch and made the deposit lahti turned on the engine selene got into the car as matt was about to go out the driveway lahti pulled in front of him stay in the car mary she did nt bother to argue but simply followed him up to the jetta matt kishketawa rolled down the window jeez lahti he said disgusted whats your problem this time selene did nt say anything she saw mary huddled into the back seat as if for warmth simon kishketawa riding shotgun looked confused would you step out of the car please ms omashinaway she stared straight ahead blindly mary leaned forward selene selene slumped down in her seat and began to sob mary reached down into canvas bag on the floor of the car wrapped bundle of money carefully counted by herself and selene lay in the courier bag how the heck did you get this from the sealed money bag into here asked mary selene just shook her head lahti nudged mary away from the door helped selene out of the car and began patting her down after cuffing her and reciting her rights he turned to mary we ll get statement at the station to her cousins he added follow me in your car all right ll need to ask you some quesitons too and not in the mood to chase anyone down tonight as he and mary took selene to his car the noise of mary heels clicking on the pavement sounded high and cold in the night late the next morning when she should have been in her governmental accounting standards class mary sat in her office with lahti she been shooed out of the sherrif office while selene was still incommunicado and apparently things hadnt improved much in the past six or seven hours she just sits there she sits in the questioning room and stares at the walls she sits in her cell and stares at the bars bet if took her to circus she sit there and stare at the tentflaps lahti sounded disgusted with himself did dad show up while you were there yeah he arrived about an hour ago he said he talk to her wish him luck getting her to talk back he real good at that he can probably match her stare for stare and then some but look what found she pulled out one of the money pouches see they have our name and everything on them that real cute oh hush the point is we get the same ones back selene just picks picked six up every week they re all this stiff leather see she pointed at the sides and then at seam started looking at the seams of this one today it took me while to find this look she pushed the bottom corners together hard and the seam between them popped open about two inches there wax along it so all you have to do is press she suited actions to words to make it seem whole again think she was taking the money when she sat in the back seat one wrapped bundle is usually about 1500 give or take few dollars you could get one bundle out each time with few problems especially with the guards looking more for robbers outside the car than in she looked pleased with herself for about two seconds and then her face fell id sure like to know why she did it she was making decent money relatively speaking thought she had repo problems yes but that was before she got this job she just been working for the oec for about six months then there her brothers halfbrothers she interjected whatever have you noticed any sign of drug use with her does she hang out with her half brothers much do you think would have let her be our courier if thought she was druggie do have stupid written on my forhead in letters of flame she wondered her dad died an alcoholic she was scared of cough medicine forget real drugs but she did nt seem estranged from her halfbrothers or anything figured she just grabbed lunch with them now and then saw them on holidays borrowed their socket wrenches or whatever occasionally the usual the usual familial stayawaycloser stuff to be honest she does nt show any signs of regular drug use no nasal damage track marks disorientation she may be unresponsive but she damn well aware dont know what all to do with her except arrest her for theft and even then we probably wo nt be able to prove that she took anything but that 1500 wish knew what she done with the rest deposited it what she put 18000 into her savings account checking afraid noninterest bearing not good investment proceedure but then she never seemed to have good money management skills not everyone has mary the market queen to advise them said sherrif obequot he stood in the door holding three cups of coffee lahti grabbed one gratefully and gulped it back thanks hank so did selene talk to you yeah some he handed one cup of coffee to mary and sipped his own seems she scared of someone here wanted the money to run away get new start scared of whom asked mary that she would nt say do nt think its anyone in the tribe though ran few names by her family members some other people who ve been in and out of jail and she did nt even blink no say its an outsider he grinned at lahti not you issac mentioned your name and she just looked disgusted would nt expect any homecooked dinners from that girl soon what about the drugs asked mary hank turned to her what the madosh brothers got hauled in on drug charges oh lord was it just yesterday afternoon maybe she got involved in something there mary just got done telling you that she did nt look like user commented lahti but her halfbrothers were and they knew distributer too someone who had access to bigtime stuff some kind of dealer what if she knew something about that mary voice grew thoughtful if someone wanted to deal at the casino theyd have to go through member of the tribe that all we hire for staff you found coke on the madosh brothers expensive stuff say someone came up with an offer for them and she found out about it do nt think she go for dealing herself and if someone knew she knew and was nt involved someone might get real nervous about her running around loose selene is nt total fool she know nowin game if she saw it and start looking for an exit she looked at her dad sound good sounds gorgeous he replied now all you have to do is prove it could run the scenario by her and see if she cracks lahti sounded doubtful hed gotten his fill of silent stares last night no you go home and get some sleep gon na need you awake tonight said hank what tonight the madosh brothers made bail which suprised the hell outta me think someone wants them out of jail and want to know why you re gon na follow them from the second they hit the streets until their court date you ll see who they talk to who they wave to who they make googlyeyes at who they whistle at and everything else they do ca nt get everything do nt like off this reservation but gon na take care of this yessir lahti did nt quite salute but he did raise his coffee mug several inches they ll think they sprouted third head hmph its not like they ever used the two they ve got hank waved him out then he turned to mary ca nt tell you to keep your nose out of this you can try she thought can tell you that want you where can find you for the next few days go to class go to work go home do nt bother lahti and stay the hell away from our minidrug lords bother lahti you re the one who stuck me with him in the first place mary sensed the familiar lines of debate rising between them it made her feel warm and fuzzy like hallmark cards were supposed to but did nt oh dem family traditions mary had nt meant to bother lahti the park was on the way home from school and she had nt wanted to skip two days in row tim madosh was in the park he come up to her as matter of fact mary nice to see you instead of your dad for change he beamed goofy grin at her he was cute kid if you liked them kinda vacant around the eyes hi yourself tim where your brother normally they were joined at the hip oh he had some stuff to do tim waved hand vaguely towards the mens restroom he looked at his feet examined hole in his sneakers and then looked at her sorry about all well like you know uh yeah tim think she saw too many mystery movies or something mean its not like anyone he looked around slightly suprised anyone what can this man hold train of thought for ten seconds straight she wondered just before he crumpled at her feet red stain began to soak through the front of his jacket as she bent down he grasped her wrist tightly then his eyes went truly blank she sat in the hospital surrounded by sick worried or wounded people wondering who to put down for next of kin on tim medical forms lahti had come running at tim collapse but his brother had taken one look at the situation and taken off there were roadblocks up and an apb out but no one held much hope of seeing him soon selene knew warning when she saw one and had clammed up again she was nt gon na come out of jail until her court date his dad was years dead car accident if she remembered right tim mom perhaps she was still alive but was visiting her sister in cheboygan oh well it not like she had time limit on claiming the corpse ms madosh could drive back slow and easy she felt someone settle in the seat next to her mary lahti looked at her worry showing on his face need lift home got ta fill out these forms first one thing good at its filling out forms she filled in few more blanks in her careful handwriting then set the paper on the nurses station have you found the gunman yet no we ve got some witnesses but they mosty contradict one another he didnt sound too hopeful mary tried to remember how many unsolved murders there were in the us each year 2000 3000 you think she remember the numbers its just beginning is nt it do nt think so even if we did nt find the dealer we ve cut off his connections at the oec or rather the dealer had are the connections really gone she leaned her head back wearily we ve got all that money changing hands we ve got people coming in every night who can drop more than most of us make in year even if we can keep the crooks out and the drug dealers and the rest of the criminal types do nt know if it ll do any good maybe some of us will be so well off that we ll be able to throw money away on blackjack and roulette but that wo nt be for long time how many are gon na get tired of waiting she rubbed her eyes the whole casino rests on the lie get rich quick is everyone gon na keep the job and the lie separate from real life do nt know you seem to know but do nt really like money he laughed and she realized how strange that sounded especially from her it true money like power in motor like seeing how to tune the motor to get it running best or how other types of engines work money for its own sake never really appealed to me guess honest cause dishonesty wo nt get me anything want guess you ve got goal then you better tune the oec motor to get the rest of the tribe what they want they re not just seeing money madness and power plays in the casino its on tv at the movies everywhere you look everyone preaching that money gets you power gets you money gets you power as cyclic as the seasons that pretty strong message especially if you ve been short on both for long while so so you re gon na have to work out cycle of your own and show that it works you ve made good start with tribal investments like quick raven she got her own currency of information how that fit in your financial motor metaphor pretty well guess knowlege is power oh yeah and knowhow putting the knowlege to work for you that power too come on he offered her his arm she pointedly stood up on her own then smiled and put her hand on his sleeve together they walked past the seats full of wounded people and into the late november evening
