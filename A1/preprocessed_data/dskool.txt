dream school chapter one early years first choices jon three time find best possible prekindergarten parents eldon marie well educated successful brilliant insisted best jons education montesorri school downtown logical choice started friendly young woman interviewed gave usual sales pitch dozen questions large payment enrolled fall semester afterthought young woman told parents new school outside city called dream school really entirely new type school nt compete directly montesorritype schools either schedule subject matter hours entirely night one night week night long subject matter lessons life learn interactions living things format fascinated new school next stop located sedate neighborhood mostly older homes quiet businesses nothing really stood new school visually rather plain office building signs outward indicator school first contact greeted door taken small interview room marla professionally dressed young woman gave jon toys occupy one corner adults talked dream school founded september 2513 almost year ago began husband aaron started help colleagues city university experiments basic concept past ten years thought time put together see would fly shorten long

hallway inside door remains closed except emergencies see rooms quite drab give extrasensory images less competition ten floors ten rooms said marie one hundred times seven nights seven hundred full right right waiting list list moves fairly quickly think would able enroll jon month two list move quickly eldon inquired financial reasons mostly financial reasons asked eldon mild apprehension try fair tuition expensive process solution ask percentage gross income parents rate indexed income increases maximum five percent highest bracket bracket ten million year combined replied eldon rate level two percent would sixteen thousand six hundred sixtysix dollars sixtysix cents per month attendance marla informed without breaking eye contact steep say replied eldon ll interviews parents list

loss voice suppose said tall man stared two silent boys yes sir think replied nurse little grin mystery bottle brought much information remarked principal boys allergy medicine sir replied eric subdued voice well seems plausible wrong picture miss roydon cock bull story goes sir seems science project involves bottle ca nt remember science teacher well easy enough two nt taking science year two little heads drooped even lower ll bet parents could help us straighten real quick said tall man re supposed declared jon softly re supposed tell whoppers either added nurse roydon ended first attempt solve mystery little bottles curiosity would held bay long though already discovered mothers given conflicting information bottles genie could nt put back bottle second suspicions mom eric mom uses spray says prevent nightmares said jon keep bugs two ingredients maybe oh seemed satisfy minutes another doubt plagued nt name medicine like medicine bottles privacy jon nt want people know

minutes nose sprayed water jon heard voices time yes fifteen minutes comes transport jon best sleeping imitation upon arrival dream school given usual neurorelaxer spray jon went dreamland happened eric asked jon look like ve seen ghost jon carefully related details abduction previous night right ten minutes second nasal spray time memory stopped asked jon nah usually get mine tomorrow night ll let know try notice lost track think windows covered memorize turns make going give squirt nose place like ll go sleep believe sure enough boys compared notes two days later experiences identical eric managed memorize turns starts stops trip following saturday boys set find tormentors found neighborhood right stumped ds corporation sight neglected get street address queried eric simple replied jon time home midnight told going concert excellent plan know transports look like right hang hours wait one come along follow right brilliant actually fairly good plan worked half past ten boys ds building going get asked slightly nervous eric re least yet look dumpster dad says known trash mean nt ever watch detective show catch lot bad guys search trash find ve use court evidence hour searching old business papers lunch scraps dirty paper towels gave left dumpster jon noticed small plastic bottle since close curfew stuffed pocket later inspection riding home bus young adventurers examined discovery little bottle label said eric excitedly yes empty ca nt even pronounce words label much less know well sure going take school certain said eric determination right said jon little grin time re going little careful know trust cousin takes graduate courses chemistry perfect chapter big discovery accomplice hey rasheed ya doin cuz great still majoring chemistry biochemistry actually working graduate degree biochemical engineering thought maybe could tell bottle said eric handed rasheed small plastic discovery dumpster rasheed quickly produced magnifying glass pocket examined object get asked rasheed demanding voice momentarily eric thought back nurse roydon office found managed say find jon uh jon jon yeah anyway found dumpster behind place call ds corporation oh yeah ve heard place kid know goes think wondering gave keep remembering happens could right powerful drug put semihypnotic state would nt recall anything happened could kid say nt like well could stay

parents confrontation eric parents max jinny calm whole thing suggested go see jon parents four proceeded eldon marie house looks like jig jinny said marie let call marla school eldon suggested marla seem surprised happened already older children catch told nt come ll talk options everyone except rasheed proceeded dream school ll fill later assured big secret revealed school marla proceeded give jon eric history purpose procedure lecture given eldon marie years earlier toured floor together wow jon eric could say marla even demonstrated imaging extrasensory projection functions rooms jon eric fully awake awesome remarked eric jon nodded head understand happened use pretense marla told new possibilities past eight years developed refer postawareness curriculum parents whether want try asked max new directions specific things happen teenagers young adults quite commonly cover subjects drugs violence various criminal activities gambling even sex might quite equal preawareness courses impact life simply knows simulation listen explanation research see simulations real possible suppose grant realism simulations said eldon would like know sons would experience sessions drugs sex yes echoed jinny emphatically simulation drugs include druglike euphoria realistic induce real tolerance addiction know also include simulations crashing drug hangovers overdosing also simulate effects addiction including withdrawal simulation would complete without episodes loss friends failure school even loss family last least simulation druginjection diseases tough one sex course courses optional pick combination like teach sex well quite frankly way simulate real thing safe abstinence physically nt want exposed carnal knowledge yet course nt simulate types sexual encounters dating gradual increases intimacy sleazy encounters whores whorehoppers lessons learned believe course whole range consequences deal pregnancy disease social ostracism violent jealousy think far sounds great said jon fast said mother marie believe require discussion home private said max course said marla brochures take time way said jinny collect data simulations courses mean nt wire people engaged pertinent activity yes correct realism achieved recording actual impressions happen ethical questions arose development courses obvious reasons cases simply wired volunteer subjects recorded impressions period time somewhat clumsy however since receiving recording equipment must within one hundred meters subject function one solution wire members number gangs teenage hoodlums station equipment hideouts managed get carry tiny receiverrecorders persons left premises cases went countries get data case encourage suggest behavior simply paid people allow us record activities kept long enough get needed re saying kids going experiences hoodlums vagrants criminals said marie yes right average wellbehaved teenager would tracked years given us necessary data kids making mistakes fast rate used get trouble asked jon money course cases actually saved lives alerting authorities close death satisfied deal well quite lot think said max better go home get started discussions long emotional end realism urge protect one child exposure reality boys signed courses except eric nt allowed take sex drug courses growing fast hours changed weekends days evenings new courses boys became excited experiences past future anticipation future experiences drove little imaginations wild soon however exhilaration new thrills began give way cold hard realities consequences actions thought gonner became frequent refrain boys describing course experiences fact knew simulation somehow got lost heat moment eventually however became somewhat blas simulations excitement dwindled anticipation evaporated became matteroffact parents quite satisfied results courses boys nt gotten serious trouble parents children thought time examine options passing present working courses young adults marla told since ready yet another option would think two boys gathering data us right age range already wired reception could easily change wiring transmissiontype provide receivers recorders would pay trouble boys decided could go courses helped create free charge boys nt delinquents hoodlums jinny strongly objected good point marla agreed courses weve decided different approach think volatility teenage years gives way different set problems young adult rather exploring wild temptations think main focus beginning build life think set start things way reasons others want focus course average young adult think way get relevant data typical student courses designed sort courses asked max cover typical crossroadstype decisions young adults must make think marriage jobseeking homeseeking adult friendmaking kids fall category adding others data comes probably continue add long receive data data dozen young adults threeyear span plan gather five years starting courses think sounds interesting think give lot thought eldon commented anything else need know perhaps interested know teenage studies vital signs subjects constantly monitored course subjects must carry recorders leave home monitoring effective portable recorders record emergency transmitter sends distress signal vital signs indicate emergency thorough said max ll equally thorough discussion let know chapter leaving nest high education jon eric reluctant research subjects first resented intrusion privacy little portable recordertransmitter devices clumsy boys left home without several times sometimes intentionally sometimes soon ceased however learned would paid days left home privacy concerns greatly relieved marla told data name tags encoded raw form said downloaded phone lines became anonymous soon taking granted nothing easy way make bucks fact parents let keep made palatable entered local university time different goals jon interested pure science wanted pursue biophysics eric liked sports girls fast cars beer order wanted major physed campusology end five years jon advanced degree biophysics hot job prospects eric social disease fouryear degree secondary education tryout majorleague soccer club data bank dream school full enough begin young adult courses neither jon eric wanted interrupt careers take new courses even free felt already learned lessons likely dream school administrators sympathetic allowed postpone eligibility indefinitely look world come jon took position robotics manufacturer another state eric got position professional soccer team injured first season came back injury bit soon crippled could still walk run thanks prosthesis nt good enough stay team came home sulked jon learned robotics racket eric home feeling sorry sinking deeper substance abuse parents finally despaired trying help evicted sink swim eric local homeless shelter eric hit bottom money drugs dry drugs take hard look nt like saw eric decided clean act since shelter resident religious guidance counselor decided give religion try religion agreed eric soon found structure allowed set goals impose selfdiscipline reconciled parents moved back got job coach high school soccer team team well found someone spend time bought house settled jon returns dream school jon found robotmaking exciting first soon lost luster challenges always goals never seemed vary much longed something higher set purposes making widgets efficiently began think dream school yes could use man skills talent pay quite challenges goals would much loftier besides always liked marla jon surprised much older marla looked wore age well actually jon nt seen since high school jon husband aaron aaron remember jonathan haynes nt star pupil course things jon bad sir looking better time aaron quickly looked around room back jon oh calling sir thought someone else room said anyway welcome aboard marla said little grin jon remembered years thanks start another tencent tour marla suggested lead time marla began first floor support systems data reception analysis storage transmission rooms even system receive data students encountered computer simulations various courses room 3d projection data source analysis human beings recreate interaction takes place rooms explained aaron since data create simulation student data new since observed marla always statistical analysis data computer programs felt lacking human observation atypical interactions fills void gathering data students away yes since wired reception transmission recorders home even carry portables like replied aaron brings us second floor said marla overcome data take second floor storage processing added new tenstory building behind one increased student load big changes rooms re way left said aaron part first ve got new employees marla said ve got take courses nt yet next six weeks jon spent eight hours day five days week young adult courses enjoyed felt learned things process even thought recognized old data ok next boss jon asked marla debriefing replied ll spend two weeks staff discussing thought courses think improved oh wo nt take long tell everything know two weeks later jon still opinions offer bosses however agendas technical skills needed improve hardware eric rebound eric going changes married elissa expecting little girl drifted away past religious fervor looking something replace looked occult supernatural extraterrestrial read theologies number read atheist agnostic literature read philosophers great small everything read grain truth nothing quite satisfactory agnosticism however expressed lack conviction quite well eric jon met occasionally old neighborhood one occasions jon reminded eric still eligibility young adult courses dream school gave bit sales pitch experiences enough get eric started dream school going twice week hours finished course six months sure wish taken thing sooner told jon maybe would nt screwed life badly maybe look seem learned lessons look cost could ve learned without ending life probably jon agreed least would nt living edge yeah edge bitch weak irregular heartbeat away cashing monitors eric comes home jon talked marla aaron adding eric board advisors course development eric brought authenticity experience many things courses taught eric continued search light guide jon often discussed religion philosophy jon never formed convictions agnostic well found easier say believe particular thing believe state affairs persisted many years continued investigate new doctrines points view without finding anything worthwhile time dabbled politics found wanting interested art anthropology found profound meaning either opinions opinions world full opinions jon would sometimes remark yes opinion eric would reply jon usually answer except throw hands despair first big clue period uncertainty jon eric read new discovery biophysics reported investigators succeeded replicating every single molecule certain bacterium placed synthetic life form appropriate medium conditions right maximum survival chances even gave tiny electrical stimulus start watched data correct except one thing never showed signs life missing read caption picture synthetic germ equipment conditions stimulus else take let reason suggested jon data undeniable repeated experiment five times giving else could necessary basic questions defines life jon asked eric well get opinion basic criterion must process food grow reproduce leaves viruses certain semiorganic synthetic molecules things ok determine instantly alive life delicate electrical activity going body times life responds stimulus according genetic programming pain common denominator respond lot different stimuli observed eric respond reliably pain though nt yes life forms re saying life feels pain opinion shared many others field subject verification yet indications point conclusion scientists put synthetic bacterium feels pain asked eric mean think molecule feels pain probably collection feel pain spark theory nt know nt collection molecules nt know come living thing instead cold test tube maybe kind spark must passed order life exist woah re getting pretty deep washedup jock plastic knees however seem point suppose spark gets go die yeah nt answers jon questions re expert eric spark metaphysics maybe field mine spark thing ordinary physics assure run across good theories many journeys great minds human race lots involve concept soul according religions posses immortal soul also accord privilege animals go far say living creatures one even says rocks everything else world alive whatever case seems logical candidate spark feel pain makes much sense anything else according religious consensus soul passed mother child come air none know claim mother gives child soul nt say exactly come either still accept view living things soul gives mechanism sensing pain therefore alive ok suppose accept hypothesis deduce premise recycled souls much really said eric religions postulate souls recyclable go many life experiences many different life forms reincarnation also part philosophical disciplines makes sense really recycle otherwise might die day born life recycling different forms certainly get much wider range experiences view would certainly please animal rights advocates would would like idea lawn right mowed trees right cut esthetic reasons ah digress said jon yes nt re supposed great parallel life sum concluded probably immortal soul probably recycle may even recycle forms life soul feels pain makes us alive responsive pain stimuli lead us something vaguely familiar scenario souls safe harm physical means re going experiences learn consciously remember lessons next life perhaps us subconscious mind level nt sound vaguely familiar mention sounds like giant version early dream school chapter putting together nature takes course jon eric nt discuss philosophy much many months maybe whole idea life like dream school strange maybe bored philosophy jon turned attention part life long neglected social life began dating young woman named catrina dataprocessor dream school generally enjoyed life offer eric doubledated sometimes foursome got quite famously jon catrina number interests common catrina intellectual women jon met good chess trivia games absolute whiz logic puzzles fascinated jon since never met attractive female intellectual equal times forced admit bit equal catrina elissa bit awkward first struggled find common ground elissa came bluecollar background spent life learning survival

chance consider answer invite freeze death everyone found seat living room front roaring firesimulation fake fireplace warm beverages passed around serious conversation began came tell us catrina asked jon wondered serious condescending truth halfway believe endtime upon us older two replied unless repent sins immediately doomed spend eternity hell long time eric noted somewhat mockingly yes replied younger two re headed straight attitude may right eric attitude replied jon exactly defines sin feel heart matters said older woman nothing else matters ok feelings sins asked jon list feelings considered evil sinful younger woman replied taken directly modernday revelations given eternal saint fatima two hundred fifty years ago ok based authority personally give eternal saint said eric would like know think sinful feeling authority say anything differently scriptures replied older woman younger one could speak yet authority say historical figure knew truth argued eric say certainty person knew truth able recognize truth reputation person nt understand question sir replied older woman said younger woman trying sarcastic way question roots faith sir answer faith based love read writings eternal saint feel community believers well spoken observed elissa believe saying able recognize love believe truth must come love right yes replied young woman father loved dearly observed catrina always said things thought best know hard tried nt always tell truth every time best could tell believed true anyone expected know loved dearly yet wrong sometimes spite love way know true asked older woman excellent question injected eric field eric said jon time reveal us jon ca nt reveal one reveal anyone else person must reveal makes sense replied eric matter much little intelligence person person still sole judge truth otherwise mean expected pass judgment truthfulness holy scriptures asked young woman incredulously already nt replied eric nt already proclaimed true yes re quite right said older woman first smile either shown suppose judge truth read disagree anything writings asked eric replied older woman certainly even part says woman allowed speak church asked eric question wait gets home ask husband ve never read proclaimed younger woman nt read replied eric yes right observed older woman new testament many stops make may leave literature course said catrina soft smile thank visit re welcome replied made way cold january wind eric explains well eric ran tell us true meaning life said elissa one tiny step time child said eric pious smile ok ll bite said jon first step good bad first step unbelieving friend define good bad eric pontificated said catrina let hear well list re expecting really quite simple eric began everything feels good comfortable calming us consider good everything feels bad uncomfortable unsettling us consider bad includes ideas people activities even inanimate objects got sounds simple observed jon replied eric true think think someone evil person makes fell bad uncomfortable unsettled right asked catrina every time replied eric ask nt jon chided elissa take ve heard catrina asked oh yes getting started replied think got something said jon sure want catch saying things ought eric excellent question replied saying things always person decides right wrong usually method described agree everyone equally valid opinion right wrong even two agree exactly right wrong real mind individual disagree idea universal standard judge people supernatural force called evil causes us sin really position say things agree said catrina next eric next step learn altruism illusion said practically everything think done thought seek pleasure avoid pain see must understand defining pleasure every good feeling satisfaction contentment agreement gratification relief feeling positive side pleasurepain scale pain hand every negative feeling precise opposite feelings mentioned help needy person want happy conscience feels better noble yes feel sympathy person plight mainly act feels good comfortable us help person need selfish altruistic help others pleasure principle words feels good already observed catrina well put replied eric might add feels bad already trying avoid yes see probably right said jon ca nt think anything feels bad things feel bad avoid greater pain later insightful observation said eric next oh great teacher asked catrina little mocking tone reincarnation next step child understand reincarnation see without reincarnation many lives make sense short spent solitude spent constant pain example include possibility reincarnation life without sense random small part much larger continuum means course must concede existence eternal aspect mean spark thing soul said jon correctamundo perfect universe next catrina inquired next step put elements together try make collective sense done away concepts good evil replaced concept pleasurepain driven universe stipulated universe contains immortal beings mortal bodies furthermore given credence idea immortal beings recycle endlessly life form life form picture colors paint picture see said jon universe pain pleasure utmost importance time almost meaningless catrina added process life universe quite universal mean pretty well equally valid everyone everywhere since everyone feels pain tempted pleasure clear evangelists teacher kind needed explain anyone purpose life nt need kind purpose pleasure pain asked jon indeed replied eric know old saying kill us teaches us seems bit simple jon remarked agree simple replied eric examine human history note failure grasp simple truths greatest collective weakness see forest trees way whole purpose leaving peaceful state spiritual bliss immortal beyond come learn lessons pain pleasure asked catrina yes logical conclusion tenants incorporated view universe past minutes leads one suspect purely spiritual beings probably nt experience pain pleasure limits knowledge end goal lessons point asked jon progressed beyond ability speculate replied eric perhaps become enlightened beings perhaps become potential become really ca nt look human race see direction development seem people learned anything six million years existence see point said catrina still things picture like one thing lose logic face wars natural disasters religions say nt ask god allows things happen say horrors part scheme happen random accept effects physical pain disappear physical death nothing happens us physically particular life affect us next ok nt remember past lives benefit lessons learned asked jon good question replied eric wish easy answer nt perhaps lessons remain subconscious mind perhaps remember spiritual state lives difficult say nature verses nurture question mean ca nt tell whether person born mean made mean mistreatment said jon case nt real question born mean genetic inheritance enviornment past life experience yes re right said replied eric view three variables could make person mean kind whatever way tell source responsible percent personality therefore impossible determine person evolving particular direction dealing parents genes andor childraising abilities leave unknown also unspoken uncertainty principle sounds pretty random ask said catrina excellent point said eric accept universe described far natural randomness uncertainty perfectly adequate explain ups downs life longer need seek moral explanations happens us explanation needed simply things happen nt matter happens learn none hurt us death take away stings nt see perfect getting excited dear normal said elissa eric chance ever hear heisenberg uncertainty principle asked catrina philosopher preacher philanderer physicist 1927 paper published physics journal called zeitschrift fr physik end paper concluded know matter principle present details speaking directly matter atomic level course implications enormous sir isaac newton postulated would possible predict entire course future knew position momentum every particle universe today idea perfect prediction meaningless since know position momentum even one particle live universe nature unpredictable uncertain interesting point point unpredictability built universe makes impossible us accurately predict precisely alter future since either avoid pain lives matter carefully plan execute plans makes
