extremely hazardous duty single unattached experienced personnel considered duty anthony glanced displays helmet enterprise arriving soon thought entered system stepped security sector system extremely tight enterprise would approach always te4 space dock fewer people saw ship even knew better consequences information falling wrong hands picard officers enterprise knew well enterprise ship visited te4 also records kept visits sensors never used check construction site simple beacons indirect communications proof enterprise anything reason picard went along knew basic ultimate mission

deactivated highly stressed one talk enter personal logs revealed details mission standing along corridors one lower decks long line assorted star fleet personnel bags packed mostly looks irritation relegated one small comparatively area ship basically quarantined regular personnel contact permitted parts ship without escort even though need extreme security carefully laid still enough complaining make whole lot start feeling discontentment ca nt believe keep us holed one area enormous ship whole trip nt even decency use transporters get us quickly like first nt want us nt want us leave man sounding one usual complainers large barrel shaped bearded human apparently sort expert weaponry one quite sure since boasted proficiency everything mr dolittel nt bless us silence re finally getting somewhere still must listen babble speaker ten places hall dolittel dark skinned humanoid could look dolittel square chest slim well proportioned compared human female wore yellow uniform insignia security tall means well muscled high forehead reminiscent klingon nt one long black hair pulled braid hung middle back commander tarva sir nt see dolittel mumbled turned back toward transporter room dolittel griping come halt least tarva stood patiently satchel feet stance classic military atease posture though star fleet academy alumni bringing background homeworld strict military strict military background helped move quickly pseudomilitary star fleet could hear constant hum transporters room ahead line slowly moved forward suspicious nature profession could help feel lined like algots going slaughter enterprise transporter room dissolved around new one took place room extremely large maybe ten times size enterprise larger background immediately showed self figured one could transport nearly whole kalonian battalion one time told could transported us quarter time wanted course dolittel would first thing hear upon arrival standing front control panel section transporter average hight slightly balding human long blackgray hair pulled back pony tail man wearing loose fitting black uniform visible sign rank standard star fleet insignia uniform several large

realization made smile think going like man man white coveralls construction worker stepped forward asked id cards handed man black uniform man looked card though obvious done every person come aboard still actually read least name card looking someone trying match everybody name face first time welcome aboard said handed cards back man coveralls captain anthony hum another portion large transporter could heard next please follow gentleman ll show quarters patient ship still construction things nt working yet also going share quarters personnel designed others ready gathered belongings stepped transporter woman white coveralls asked new arrivals transporter id cards commander tarva captain said tarva turned exit group yes sir said facing captain coming attention please report back get settled yes sir repeated captain turned attention new batch id cards transporter pad hummed new arrivals many people would thought captain anthony rude least curt tarva impression man extremely busy much happening around tarva fully appreciate workers different styles white coveralls worked around bunches optical cord hung open ceiling panels sparks flew welding torches still construction understatement tarva also thought captain order report soon settled nt quite sure soon man expected things one time first would unpack find way back transporter room still could nt help wondering captain wanted perhaps assignment would important signal perhaps chief security nt much expect since chief security eclipse even escort ship still responsible position ever one top security positions background extensive simply standing guard transporter room cabin door slid open man white said room one quarters remember said temporary rest completed somehow tarva found standing front group stepped believe eight us crammed obviously meant four freaking enlisted barracks kind chicken outfit anyway familiar voice came apparently head tarva walked one bunk slightly separated rest without doubt prime real estate room occupants bunks empty one built top bunk least desirable room tarva picked equipment already bunk choice dropped middle room put place occupants room dolittel regular companions said nothing best ignore chime sounded one walls name appeared computer screen mine one room mates said got retrieve stack folded black cloth drawer came wall approached joined dolittel head asked somebody say something eventually response tall blonde haired woman sitting far side room tossed tarva laminated card welcome aboard uss vigilante mandatory meeting personnel 0830 shuttle bay give chance get settled crew assignments handed time ship uniforms available replicators room program required size standard star fleet issue boots appropriate slight wait may necessary full power currently line please make comfortable possible soon quarters finished assigned tarva checked time piece 0600 plenty time get whole crew enterprise even current rate put stuff middle floor dolittel bellowed emerged head wiping water face small towel already wearing black uniform identical captain shoulders filled doorway hair brushed top frame gaze shifted bunk claimed gear tarva smiled slightly said honestly think comfortable one regular beds temporary cots quite lumpy dolittel looked friends moment seemed would stand tarva instead picked bags threw empty bunk sir said tarva everyone must make sacrifices mr dolittel responded said computer working replied generic female voice commander tarva requesting complete ship uniform gave size particulars going wait ve placed orders two come back far said tall blonde chime rang another gang said must approached drawer looked screen saw tarva name flashing things fouled said says commanders stuff gestured toward tarva held pants small anybody room except tarva thank said took bundle head stood door way looking inside crew member went change came immediately half dressed wore baggy uniform pants black tank top type shirt rest uniforms obviously gathered quickly bunched one arm got mistake thing got rest us qued sequence placed orders said lieutenant replicator typical place said dolittel even computer nt know hell doin nt worry ill get things straightened around soon let get work tarva stood restroom front full length mirror yellow standard uniform lay pile near feet looked mirror wearing tight black tank top matching midthigh shorts right shin strapped black sheathed knife appeared bone handle flat black blade obviously regulation studied scars visible shoulder arms lower legs many human doctor offered remove scars none seemed comprehend pride took battles represented looked closely left cheek neck fine line scar extending left eye cheek neck shoulder zealous human doctor meticulously repaired wound years humans space still treated cultures human values never occurred kalonian would view scar differently human however could nt feel bad towards doctor since served star ship rescued escape pod eclipse destroyed commander tarva aboard uss vigilante exactly 30 minutes walked transporter room ii report back captain anthony room empty new personnel captain workers workers busily something transporter pads control panel captain anthony looked concerned studied output tricorder skinny man white uniform showing anthony looked tarva walked smiled welcome back commander said hope found quarters acceptable time nt expect ll spending lot time said walked stood attention commander may suspected current staff quite slim fact today crew assigned vigilante arrive leaves unique position selecting staff relatively small pool volunteers gone records personnel assigned vigilante personally selected assignments crew member decisions easy someone navigator engineer specific rank basically fall place top command staff never easy however chief engineer chief security others require little intuitive thought paused check skinny man tricorder tarva thought would nt telling nt getting chief security reason telling said turning attention back difficult choice make chief security man named simon norton boarding soon get thing fixed head security three different star ships recently galaxy class giving volunteer mission know man desire command position one best comes security tarva could feel world shaking sure getting position never occurred someone credentials would volunteer blind suicide mission like rumored know may slightly disappointing commander major understatement seemed know could nt however put someone record diverse background ordinary position chosen first officer congratulations thank sir managed utter complete shock done purpose set fall pushed edge caught last millisecond man vicious sense humor going really enjoy working commander work one positions nt filled yet chief engineer several qualified personnel captain anthony pointed mess around sweeping gesture suppose good time make decision first assignment get mess working give call ready continue transfer process sir nt enterprise transport remainders tarva asked took whole transporter room order keep minimum distance need power transporters two pads ones ship currently work decide chief engineer get thing working ve got working 0700 everybody going make meeting captain anthony left room eight white coveralled workmen looking tarva door slid completely shut first officer tarva hand intercom lieutenant commander dolittel report transporter room two immediately transporter room ii soon filled tarvas roommates plus others dolittel feet stuck open access panel transporter pad cursing could heard across room slid sat hell thing said ve never seen circuits like state art transporter technology came woman voice open transporter room door medium height brown haired humanoid slight ridge along upper cheek bones making eyes appear sunken obvious nonhuman feature wore standard white coveralls construction workers doctor cembera known behind mess said dolittel stood greet new arrival thing weve trying get back line detained engine room one installing new style dilithium crystal chamber said approached troublesome transporter pad turned commander tarva running diagnostics transporter control panel first officer tarva crystal cembera chief engineer charge construction vigilante glad finally able join us te4 glad finally said tarva could help chief engineer get things line doctor cembera looked dolittel slight grin said nt hard dolittel cembera obviously history nt seem stop ignoring dolittel easily everybody else doctor cembera started running diagnostic transporter pointing certain details new technology dolittel main idea boost effective range three four times great step forward dolittel said ve got largest transporter room mockup ve ever seen next supply ship parts need get three transporter rooms working properly doctor cembera said ignoring dolittel comment technology new taking quite get chips made world get two pads work still waiting chips make chips probably failed dolittel muttered two pads working said still ignoring comments long exhausting job guess something came loose doctor cembera crawled pad disappeared workings soon emerged pad handed dolittel blackened fistsized component pads figured power related since run computer circuitry said reached panel opened near wall panel contained several different kinds parts obviously spares retreated back transporter pads came back said ok fire dolittel pressed couple buttons transporters lit right well said looks like ive got bit learn effective chief engineer well nt worry seem good teacher tarva said quite ll even ready begin space trials cembera added said come john ill give tour engine rooms one new style dilithium dolittel could heard saying door slid shut behind tarva frowned realized dolittel walked dismissed people arrived would make sure proper star fleet regulations maintained pressed intercom button commander tarva captain anthony transporters back line sir thank commander replied ll right please inform enterprise re back line tarva tall blonde room mate working transporter controls turned top rated operator happened last group transporting enterprise general abort warning issued engineering warning almost immediately followed massive power surge nt chief swanson reflex action warning eight personnel transport would surely lost able reverse beam surge got transporter surge catch personal pad number one result pulled person transport crimson flash crew chance cover resulting gore whole transporter room immediately splattered red pad lay writhing mass tissue bone blood spurting organs transporter room ii immediately emptied construction workers crew racing doors many losing last meal way others slipped fell blood chief swanson fist officer tarva captain anthony ones hold ground captain anthony chief swanson gone ghost white shock commander tarva looked captain instructions could say get rid tarva walked security panel removed phaser pointed former crew member thought pushed trigger wonder exactly 53 seconds since alarm sounded captain picard sat ready room image captain anthony monitor front anthony several drops blood face looked slightly ill behind anthony worker red stained white coveralls cleaning blood wall view tight anthony worker occasionally visible ever happened picard thought unlike transporter accident ve ever heard ever new technology re using project radically new dangerous according records ensign shertz primary navigator anthony saying without anybody currently qualified position captain picard aware ship like enterprise likely several officers qualified fill position captain anthony picard said suggesting assign one junior officers project reply merely suggesting may someone crew qualified position also falls criteria willing volunteer given chance picard thought second said ll put request qualified personnel ll trust decision let know found navigator anthony screen immediately went black picard sat staring silence minute said computer list ship personnel qualified navigator star ship working generic female voice said immediately displayed list 30 names delete personnel married known living family three names remained list commander data ensign janice omalley ensign ro laren captain picard sat looked three names neatly printed black screen would knew mission project would jump chance however regulations could tell extremely dangerous mission perhaps even suicide mission three officers knew one three qualified project would certainly volunteer picard decided post general notice thirty original list perhaps slight chance one felt could replace would volunteer would cross bridge came strictly volunteer mission could make anyone anyway feel obligated volunteer within minutes posting notice signal door commander data sir said notice believe logical choice fill navigator position unless count lore living relative know star fleet recognize next kin data picard said expecting tried figure way turn request without giving little information project decided however properly satisfy must fill little information five minutes later data left ready room fully satisfied would extremely hazardous transfer project left passed red haired ensign omalley way meet captain occurred list qualified navigators good true janice thought walked see captain picard chance transfer secrete project dangerous mission good boring star charting hauling diplomats around ensign ro taking every time getting interesting tour ended would surely assigned primary navigator somewhere sir said almost door closed behind volunteers navigator position yes one said however upon close scrutiny record decided appropriate assignment picard sat back watched face light excitement sir respectfully request transfer ensign omalley feel obligation tell little mission picard said notice always stated hazardous duty however since approaching last minute replacement think know consider suicide mission sir suicide mission omalley said quite taken aback say said hazardous people know consider suicide mission think sir asked still bit confused captain picard trying say works well worth costs said else say personal interest success mission picard took deep breath looked beautiful young woman standing front large gray eyes looked back expectantly finally said still interested ll arrange transportation go start packing gear thank sir said snapped attention dismissed said ensign janice omalley turned sharply exited ready room left captain jeanluc picard looked personal file screen whole conversation noted time circumstances adoptive father death wolf359 looks like date destiny time lives said closed door finally happening getting look side forbidden horizon janice could feel great apprehension though stepping unknown always bit scary could feel pulse race anticipation packed belongings third string navigator ship never rated larger quarters ensign omalley however woman possessions vega5 nothing else taught approach life minimalist belongings really nt care larger billet last thing packed old style picture frame picture father taken first visit earth still young maybe fifteen earth years old considered child yet quite woman standing front ancient ruins country father claimed family name originated wrapped picture carefully uniform placed case possessions would always treasured wondered would transfer new assignment survivors transporter incident transpoted odd looking shuttle wondered would send way back get nt really sure happened transporter something gone wrong end someone navigator killed expect transporters working anytime soon current distance enterprise could transport chief obrien voice came intercom ensign omalley please report transporter room gear thought said chief obrien upon entering transporter room unable transport got re system back line thought thing said gave new coordinates different transporter apparently shut unused area brought back line help tie loose ends enterprise departure janice hesitated stepping onto transporter pad though done many times never immediately following fatal accident looked obrien smiled nodded head stepped onto pad stood attention waited enterprise transporter room dissolved around replaced smaller spartan room front behind transporter controls stood man white coveralls welcome four space dock said well ready transport ship minutes right janice could see large space station style window vantage point thought could see hull ship would like take look new assignment man asked ensign janice omalley put bags place stepped window outside something never seen star ship space dock unlike star ship though small older style saucer section dwarfed four new galaxy style warp engines saucer attached directly bulbous main body without usual neck lifting away impulse engines appeared raised main body behind saucer things wrong color nt standard star fleet white dull gray name number designation anywhere seen clear view top saucer section anomalies antenna pods miss placed orifices etc indicative either old style saucer new style engines anything else matter asked man standing next also admiring ship called uss vigilante said kind name star ship asked really expecting answer nt ask said work transporters hope nt running transporter last time said slight smile sir said besides caused power surge engineering signal intercom whelp captain ready time report duty said guess said returned transporter small transporter room dissolved view time replaced much larger one front stood man long grayblack hair thinning top pulled back pony tail wore slightly baggy black uniform several large pockets though wore obvious insignia man must kind authority could move stood attention said ensign janice louise omalley reporting duty sir welcome aboard uss vigilante ensign man black said captain anthony bring personal file yes sir said handed small computer disk outside pocket bag good said slipped disk tricorder holding leave bags delivered quarters right late already postponed meeting please come left finally noticed several people blood stained white coveralls vigorously cleaning transporter room another clean coveralls approached bags soon left transporter pad also noticed personal pad left shattered blackened could feel nausea catch throat ever happened must horrifying corridor men white coveralls hard work many areas exposed superstructure could see several decks framing one point edge along exposed girders keep falling next deck area work man given hard hat wear passing nt late would taken safer longer route captain said edged along beam finally arrived shuttle bay filled hundred black uniformed crew ensign omalley never thought would feel place federation star ship uniform surrounded crew dressed baggy black uniforms definitely felt place captain walked short dark skinned woman high klingon type forehead long braid hair back ensign omalley said first officer commander tarva commander tarva janice said greeting commander tarva nodded said least ve lasted longer last navigator attention please captain said loud speaker like personally welcome aboard fulton class star ship uss vigilante unique craft ever conceived star fleet like say remind mission volunteered intent extended hazardous duty mission may tour several years little contact star fleet fact many analysts believe heard want reflect minutes tell exact destination transfers shore leave vigilante mission completed second thoughts leave collect belongings report transporter room enterprise currently standing start way back last assignment stirring among crew sunk several groups discussed amongst finally three individuals stepped forward announced second thoughts well captain anthony said want thank dedication got far returned previous position mention incident appear records must also remind never talk project details considered top secret also anybody persists questioning must reported star fleet security finally must never even discuss project amongst selves leave ship never happened clear yes sir said together dismissed captain anthony said watched three exit shuttle bay may guessed uss vigilante ship peace captain anthony began ship war war right war vigilante designed take war enemy order hasten construction vigilante parts used destruction first battle enemy face one strongest irresistible federation ever faced enemy going meet borg revelation slight murmur rose crowd finally voice came crowd sir expect accomplish 30 ships destroyed fighting one borg cube plan attack one ship made junked parts gotten captain anthony smiled reaction expected since one project committee got originally approached star fleet listen said superstructure maybe made old parts however technology put ship cutting edge every area notice parts functions recognize whole ship become proving ground radical new ideas job test use new ideas already know use new components vigilante things may go wrong accepted mission best confident working designers vigilante learn new technology become confident ability actually pull sure also aware borg ability gain knowledge computers prisoners therefore imperative unnecessarily discuss functions departments departments new designs areas ship technology know borg attribute federation another unique feature vigilante computer systems though central computer day day needs life star ship area separate computer system systems totally inaccessible central computer create problem galaxy class star ship actually operated five crew members automated mode vigilante needs fifty highly trained crew keep maneuvering warp bit exaggeration wanted keep toes ever may pass toes crew received assignments work construction personnel preparing vigilante duty know lot work left little time certain work together ship ready schedule also expect know ship inside first space trials lets get work dismissed simon norton entered meeting room last usual great propensity late never seemed however nt fault transporter failed twice ever got aboard ship last time left stranded enterprise trip vigilante eye opener transport sent retrieve means shuttle troop carrying drop ship designed rapid deployment personnel transporter protected landing zones star fleet antiterrorist units carried kind ship even carried standard shuttle craft strange chief security star ship idea design know class layout knew something different large size shuttle bay told also narrow corridors small rooms suggested something different vigilante wished drop ship windows captain anthony sitting small room command staff commander norton finally got around joining room like rest ship painted gray drab colors middle room large dark gray table straight edges slightly bowed fit bow room around table ten high backed chairs securely fastened floor also equipped emergency restraints belts front place computer terminal sunken table one end room large display screen obviously presentations group outside wall several windows looking port side saucer along top window bottom blast shields could seen shields ship would snap shut red alerts silent running early days star fleet advances deflector shield technology blast shields installed ships meant heavy action ship destined confront borg would need small amount time norton duty spent time reviewing files officers properly see security would know working sitting next captain anthony command staff meeting room known simply command room first officer commander tarva across lt commander dolittel chief engineer fourth room tall female humanoid white coveralls construction worker sitting next dolittel commander norton unable find information construction personnel computer files distressed felt best know everyone dealings ah commander norton captain said glad finally able join us believe familiar everybody except doctor cembera doctor cembera chief engineer charge design construction vigilante doctor commander norton said slightly bowed bald head towards took seat close door meeting intended fill specifics uss vigilante said captain anthony pushed button computer terminal terminal main screen detailed picture ship appeared began rotate slowly believe ll leave lecture doctor cembera thank captain doctor cembera said stood approached screen uss vigilante designed three main features mind speed fire power stealth quickly build ship decided necessary use space frames deposited memory alpha parts used fact taken ships destroyed borg however completely refitted ship new technology material used hull drive systems ll start hull original skin components removed replaced new composite material material much less penetrable detectable known encountered scanning devices makes us virtually invisible long range scanners appear much smaller closer range sensors windows however made new material windows fitted old style blast shields power main deflectors ever lost windows without blast shields would extremely vulnerable detection known fact star fleet policy use cloaking devices ships policy however preclude research cloaking technology main goal cloaking research develop adequate detection cloaked ships research added learned klingons believe created sophisticated cloaking system ever implemented technology installed vigilante together new hull material call combined system act advanced cloaking technology act vigilante completely invisible borg others matter commander norton interrupted star fleet policy cloaking get whole ship built around cloaking technology star fleet regulations little influence ship officially exist responded captain anthony norton sat back contemplate implications captain said doctor cembera continued next obvious feature vigilante said number warp drives new technologies alignments four engines jump vigilante warp 96 subwarp speeds less second able hold warp 96 extended period time next excuse doctor lt commander dolittel said yes mr dolittel doctor cembera said bit frown anticipating coming next led team extensive research new technologies alignments call dolittel said concluded years ago create uncontrollable worm holes around ship using true commander tarva asked yes doctor cembera replied saying ve built whole ship around theory already proven flawed tarva next question next topic doctor cembera said may continue think ll able answer questions please continue doctor captain said knowing coming next lieutenant commander dolittel conclusions absolutly correct stressed lieutenant knowing much elusive promotion irritated technology tend produce uncontrollable worm hole since taking mr dolittel team started elimination worm hole effect plagued scientists long ago discussing problem colleague front young daughter daughter actually came idea made possible said proudly doctor cembera audience looked blankly continued ignoring looks daughter asked nt control worm hole tell truth never occurred mainly travel warp generated worm hole extremely unpleasant word unpleasant couple people took second look restraints chairs began realize cembera getting worm holes also throw ship many light years course control worm hole get deposit us want go even unpleasant effects could quite useful words could get worm hole place us minutes may take us year warp nine reach keep using word us planning join us planned journey dolittel use word merely figure speech sir doctor cembera answered crisply continued implemented new drives older test ship dubbed uss fulton like technology re using involves complete replacement main systems plus extensive reworking systems results extremely promising fulton ended within desired sector however bit side effect caused worm hole great deal outer hull ruptured transit however effect vigilante since technology refined great deal hull shield strengths greatly increased finally number modifications shield generators weapons transporters make vigilante actually several generations advanced even galaxy class star ship nt think bit optimistic last statement dolittel said cembera reclaimed seat tarva interjected think couple generations enough defeat borg live allow answer captain anthony said mission defeat borg rather collect extensive information hope able defeat next time arrive little arm galaxy okay questions captain anthony doctor cembera began field questions different aspects mission details ship meeting commander tarva examined commander norton medium sized humanoid bit shorter captain anthony solid build size due much genetics obvious attempt part maintain highly muscled physique could see highly defined muscles reaching neck even appeared face muscled ears pointed forehead slightly pronounced like romulan tarva background told man least part romulan background also told romulanvulcan traits extremely dominant needed one hiding somewhere family tree show kind features another oddity man totally bald head obvious least shaved head consistent cultures could readily attribute ensign janice omalley piloted gray drop ship one tau epsilon far asteroid fields next sat cocky acting young man white coveralls named picback properly strapped seats turned slightly leaned back could place feet empty area control panel still nt see flying around said navigator shuttle pilot first shuttle picback said smile highly sophisticated troop drop ship second understanding nt much need navigator vig time third navigators trained pilots things pilot navigate time guess trying make earn keep something besides rock appeared scanners must target picback said remember cloaking ca nt see us keep distance nt want running us dropping package position could watch tug disconnect cargo pod placing close proximity large asteroid lifted away could clearly read name number uss chandrasekher ncc3923c sensors told intense sensor sweep area asked picback instructions strict leave cargo detects activity area replied extremely bored whole process ensign omalley continued track tug hightailed system tug entered warp began approach cargo pod picback sat normal position began work controls drop ship slowly approached giant cargo pod soon dwarfed thing looks longer vigilante said omalley moved ever closer pod well originally designed haul couple galaxy style warp engines around room spare last delivery picback said powered magnetic cargo couplings retrofitted drop ship suppose janice asked companion trying make conversation know regs said smile re allowed discuss matters directly related jobs make small talk anything drop ship flying one believe even allowed discuss details specifically related current assignment dissertation janice laughed said could said nt know couplings clanged place slightly jolting ship okay picback said ease power slowly tub lot powerful wimpy star fleet shuttle remember lot mass mr picback fresh academy ensign omalley said slightly irritated maneuvered enterprise asteroid field occasion enterprise deflector shields probably gave quite bit room error huh picback returned jerked forward slipped accelerator bit ensign said slip accelerator bit picback said worryingly better let control ve done lot nt worry janice said slight grin picback nt notice handle pulled back control stick start maneuver arc asteroid field know quite time since ve piloted anything control stick nt tell hooked monster picback said trying show panic starting feel tried janice said said earn keep late huh sounded trying panic nt help picback new state mind proximity warning began flash scanner console ahead seemed ram rather large orange asteroid picback locked arms legs shut eyes bracing collision never occurred happened said enough time passed hit asteroid right ensign omalley said smile thing lot wider turning radius used passed two extremely close asteroids proximity warning flashed picback time react clear field whew janice said feigned wiping sweat forehead nt think make last one picback could sit hope draw red head partner huge cargo pod sped space obvious means propulsion drop ship remained cloaked approached te4 ensign omalley placed cargo predetermined orbit velocity orbit precise inorder eventually get pod matching orbit space dock idea place pod high orbit brake matching orbit dock braking since passing orbit sphere te5 drop high orbit begin heavy braking hopefully space dock would catch reached orbit untrained observer would thought procedure easy one cargo pod entered high orbit began making increasingly lower orbits space dock eventually pod seemed drop space space dock maneuvered place top framing directly vigilante picback omalley gone two days four hours maneuvered ship shuttle bay soon ship came rest airlock door flew open picback jumped fell knees kissed deck man black crew uniform stood nearby control console watching scene looked picback walked nt ever ever put ship barrel rolls way picback said shuttle bay chief passed shuttle bay chief taragoma watched ensign omalley ride slowly descending drop ship stairs lowered place combed back short red hair slightly messed long trip carried uniform jacket casually one shoulder walked put jacket fastened properly reached handed ships log wrong technician ensign asked idea sir guess little high strung said bit smile taragoma checked log looked young woman standing okay dismissed said thank sir chief smiled watched walk thought knew problems cloaking things routine missions captain anthony stood large round dimly lit chamber around workers white coveralls went business room appeared unfinished massive connecters mountings everywhere however loose wires everything large solid six evenly spaced places floor large gear shaped areas almost two meters diameter bottom gears consisted looked like thousands optical connections walls basically smooth except six large shaped channels along one wall area four round doors meter half diameter middle door sturdy looking wheel manual opening doors escape pods ceiling room appeared place made composite materials rest ship seemed laid across walls rather built none lighting permanent part room temporary work lighting captain anthony stood one side staring flat ceiling turbolift came hole floor two turbo lift channels room cable net strung across preventing anybody inadvertently stepping open hole rough side turbo lift visible single door slid open commander tarva moved net aside walked captain anthony stood attention reached said captain yes said second coming back thoughts sir construction advises bridge included new shipment tarva said well hope anthony said smile tell get installed soon possible star ship without bridge like phaser without trigger tarva flipped open looked like old style communicator relayed captains orders stepped turbo lift tarva ridden sir asked captain long till expect start moving bridge place captain anthony asked answering question estimate everything ready six hours said deck six said lift looked time piece commander would care join supervising installation uss vigilante bridge asked yes sir meet air lock two 1730 bring pressure suit gear good sir said stepped lift deck six commander tarva looked time piece 1230 five hours nothing pressing needing immediate attention would good time go back cabin rest bit gotten minimum rest since leaving enterprise need deck eight said lift tarva sat cabin short black silken robe long sleeves sitting bottom robe seemed barely touch seat chair black sheathed knife still strapped right shin water droplets tarva combing long wet hair one side head front leaning forward legs slightly spread allowing hair fall floor bare feet roommates found came tarva looked scowled ve got get cabin commander nt expect soon said chief swanson even first officer take time awhile replied stressing title thought working new shipment said whole group engineers still combing hair intention sir dolittel said formally broke boot liners gear pressure suit rest however transporter engineers wait till get bridge way dolittel saw tarva continue frown others continued make comfortable perhaps said could begin preparing transporter room three receive new chips ready sounds like good idea mr dolittel tarva said finally losing frown smiling others greatly ranked nt even question weather order suggestion picked headed back door mr dolittel tarva said last leave yes sir said would inform roommates appointments 1730 said curtly immediately turned back brushing hair 1730 yes sir repeated walked mean 1730 one companions asked dolittel means ca nt go back quarters another one said means said dolittel find something 1730 say could prepare transporter room new chips ve spent last twelve hours said chief swanson ve got every right use cabin matter roommate right kick us nt suppose tolerant cabins ready even first officer said first nt get dolittel said long four days little often seen commander tarva cabin three looked shrugged dolittel continued ll tell twice including first day fact bunk nt touched know remember made two people make bunk exactly way means go since got complaining twelve hours want go keep busy 1730 eight hours get rest 0130 hours going begin installing new transporter chips clear yes sir said unison good first make sure spread word three 1730 lt commander john dolittel like pulling rank team occasionally remind still military mission smoke filled bridge stung tarva eyes lungs recognized unmistakable cube view screen right everything began shake distance partially recognizable star ship exploded hull breach alarm sounded strong wind began rushing tarva looked captain laying arms blood poured mouth chest made sucking sound every time tried breath tarva backing towards open escape pod dragging captain entered pod blinding flash blew back pod familiar rhythm kalonian march sounded tarva head sat dark cabin trying remember movement lights came enough outline room march faded ghosts cleared tarva reached time piece said lights intensity volume level lights came enough read watch march came back pleasant thump carried old kalonian time piece needed light read quick math convert standard inconvenienced human arrogance always seemed convinced everybody went sol3 time least tarva smiled knew human thought home planet sol3 called earth many born called terra tarva used sol3 federation generic name earth class designation humans used almost planets even major star fleet allies figured appropriate used sol3 since many seemed insistent calling kalon antri4 1700 set alarm tarva took load clean clothes drawer walked head looked mirror half face gashed open left eye cheek neck blood pour wound tarva sat bed totally soaked sweat screaming sat dark cabin trying remember movement lights came enough outline room march faded commander tarva met captain anthony air lock two suit room precisely 1730 gotten much rest since coming aboard asked know ve extremely busy ve gotten enough sir replied opened bag current version space suit two main layers first gray jumpsuit biotech connections worn standard tight shorts tank top uniform jumpsuit even built feet fit boot liner parts glove liners attached jumpsuit carried bag tarva saw captain noticed knife take fit jumpsuit know said general star fleet regulations allow personal weapons carried duty yes aware regs sir said also amendments preservation federation cultures face lit ah yes smiled kalonian simtar known held hand said may presumptuous thing anybody knew kalonian simtar would know would voluntarily surrendered close friend family member traditionally parents children mates would considered very close captain must known handed looked extremely satisfied carefully pulled sheath far enough see full blade blade finish flat black edges honed bright polished black one full side sharpened third side tip curved toward shorter edge snapped blade back sheath handed back first officer less thirty seconds hear become extremely difficult find even kalon said activated suit lowering mechanism true sir tarva said stepped bottom half suit ebon metal blade made become extremely rare demand increased return traditionalism made extremely difficult families like mine always

dolittel anthony said turned face yes sir dolittel said coming attention decided vigilante high average command rank position chief engineer held someone grade higher lieutenant commander anthony paused watched dolittel squirm bit continued may remember standing policy maintain rank utill end mission leaves awkward position since wish one important positions occupied light commander two choices either second guess one policies second guess first officer stepped toward dolittel said sorry paused nt second guess first officer congratulations commander dolittel captain anthony finally

tarva approach entrance cargo bay several hours since meeting bridge tarva expressed interest shipment new pressure suits start putting together wished present first officer commander sashon tarva interesting colleague arrival vigilante commander tarva approached position said knew much qualified first officer captain however impression aspiration higher position would much prefer chief security captain mistaken commander tarva said would talk correcting error norton desire higher command position goals different star fleet officers sir commander norton said tarva arrived crew begun assembling first pressure suits good commander tarva said lets look entered cargo bay found filled shipping containers several stood open black uniformed security engineering crew pieced together several pressure suits suits like aspects ship unfamiliar design instead standard ribbed design flat almost armor like panels chest back panels solid instead flexible ribs also pronounced hinged joints commander tarva expected suits black match current color scheme uniforms suits however dull gray like hull ship tarva walked around one suits looked norton said look like something dark ages came voice cargo bay door sir tarva norton said together captain anthony said needed pressure suits warriors anthony said walked nm1 pressure suits suits armor captain turned one crew said one completed crewman pointed one suits hanging shipping container completed complete systems diagnostics first thing unpacking suits sir reply anthony turned norton said phaser please without hesitation commander norton handed captain phaser captain anthony made point showing everybody setting maximum power would enough vaporize anything smaller standard shuttle stand back said poured extended beam suit suit container jumped back force blast heat poured suit cargo container buckled present cover eyes faces heat bright red glow heat subsided quickly cargo container continued glow anthony turned one technicians said run new diagnostics also want see copy internal atmospheric record aye sir said crewman pulled special nm1 diagnostics tricorder come new suits couple minutes running diagnostics crewman said systems check perfect working order atmospheric report showed temperature inside suit risen total 10 degrees celsius phaser blast might uncomfortable harmful suits made similar material hull vigilante captain anthony said giving phaser back norton material different hull much denser cell structure disperses much energy heat reason hull made takes ten times current hull material make suit material protect even suits also built deflector shields anthony pointed life support pack nm1 suits extended life support range five days built maneuvering jets re suppose even better space walk packs use commander norton decided speak suits made basically material hull mean scanners penetrate captain anthony smiled said tell anybody want find little discussion decided commander norton first try new suit took configure suit fit would done eventually suiting walked around tested joints suit fit extremely snug compensate vacuum space nt bad said much lighter standard suit began studying

damage fighters nt even distance enough two beams appear fully become one cube glowed bright blue energy beam dispersed around shields soon ship ceased fire fighters swooped back borg time however fired cube broke formation went leader ship apparently firing weapon leader ship nt able maneuver quickly good third fighters broke remaining five cubes attacked one going leader four remaining maneuverable cubes seemed take cue spread stopped using grab cut technique started firing energy charges fighters ships quickly succumbed new method even carriers stayed background targeted large carrier released shuttle took several hits side continued releasing fighters even collected damaged ones giant bottom door rocked internal explosions fighters inside ignited chain reactions sir utlin launched star controller difficult time hit fighters could hear constant chatter fighters command semblance order controlled attacks disappeared borg dealt efficient manner destroy anything comes near chance approach cubes heard star watcher warning fire tube nt hesitate following fighters pulling away enemy thought could hear shot using star watcher point blank middle battle like unheard swung around back toward borg expected see five ships instead saw six time one broken formation going star watcher star controller tried divert cube sustained damage passed sir utlin could see ship rocking exploding fighters fuel would nt long commander travois made good pledge following many fighters headed toward cube protect leader sir utlin knew fruitless concentrate damaged ship perhaps could least destroy one diverting course toward damaged cube last saw star controller lining destiny good friends said aloud accelerated destiny great carrier lumbered toward cube attacking leader ship approached could see escape pods ejected immense carrier pride fleet dwarfed single cube carrier attached tractor beam norton looked said powering warp engines anybody could react carrier jumped warp collided borg ship explosion rocked cube causing one side cave open space could see debris flying opening almost immediately hole slowly started closing leader ship taken sustained damage nt power pull away cube regenerating hole still open fighters took opportunity enter ship several small surface explosions could seen damaged caused fighters inside first time fighters inside obviously something number maneuverable ships greatly reduced five seemed relatively good repair rest either disabled like leader ship destroyed four remaining undamaged cubes strung across battle area began meticulously destroying ships path enough game time clean borg ship involved collision two thirds finished repair hole locked back onto leader ship time cutting beam took obvious chunks haul pieces absorbed superstructure cube hole closed little borg advancing destruction leader ship evident still escape pods jettisoned suddenly borg let go ship moved away cube got distance ship self destructed within minutes one remaining ships made another suicide run cube grabbed time however borg ready ship exploded harmlessly cube remaining ships fighters took tactics borg got hold would implement sort suicide maneuver though valiant none successful borg learned first ship prepared mind made gaze sky insensate stone creed country love stand meet death alone though utter dark sink god dwells denied best triumphs beast and think humanity glorified sir utlin flew wide around cubes radio could hear reactions destruction star controller destruction also seemed push four remaining cubes action fanned started destroying everything path one things heard comrades flying cube star controller rammed sounded like good idea extra fire power may able open hole big enough get damaged cube approach sensors read shielding cube fighters flying around ship virtually ignored seemed indiscriminately firing superstructure switched general scrambled frequency attention red wing commander wing ship ship signals limited range keep confusion go ahead red wing commander blue wing least remains blue wing star fire small highly decorated carrier one first destroyed strategic targets things asked swooped massive ship sir really ve hitting anything looks important returned young voice returned fire utlin asked making highg turn flying back sir think lord dowe guns shorted pretty good must ignoring us fix damage sir utlin could nt tell ships talking since continued strafing runs well said think time pay closer visit utlin said lined run sir couple us went nt heard ca nt seem make much damage anymore voice came back think ll give try sir utlin said powered weapons sir open ll follow boy sounded confident confident die ships stopped normal runs started gravitating toward position flight patterns

stay alive furthest thing mind butchers embrace fate come let heart blood slake thirsty sod curst life offer glut hate strike strike dogs ll deny god finally six cubes reformed warped away one cube struck originally seemed unable maintain perfect formation six however continued back original course time held much slower pace warp 86 warped away norton said sir read explosion damaged borg ship screen anthony said norton put six ship formation screen zeroed area one cube nt holding perfectly formation surface series explosions appeared initiated interior finally cubes jumped warp lone single seat fighter emerged hole fighter emerged sea debris suddenly alone left behind ship came limped slowly devastation surveying survivors nt tarva turned anthony sir believe survivor captain anthony turned commander norton analysis ship norton already studying tactical scanners sir read one life form apparently uninjured ship longer warp capability lifesupport open hailing frequencies anthony said hailing frequencies open norton returned anthony stood looked fighter screen talking directly attention fighter captain anthony united star ship vigilante read short pause voice came back red wing commander please state position read scanners could however damaged anthony smiled pretty cool cat state position offer assistance another pause bit late offering assistance mean desire assistance small ship turns loops obviously looking source conversation really around would definitely appreciate assistance sound committed anthony smiled okay said going trust us nt like sound nt worry anthony said ever lied nervous laughter reply would like shut power weapons engines anthony said carefully almost flip wait anthony said added must warn power anything ll forced interpret sign aggression deal anthony beginning like guy nt seem much choice powering man still nt seem convinced norton looked powered main systems okay anthony said tell shuttle bay two lock fighter tractor beam transporter room two stand powers pull destroy ship aye sir norton said reach comm switch anthony added also security meet us shuttle bay two norton grinned slightly said stiffly course sir commander tarva anthony turned toward lifts tarva step behind going borg back dead talking linhrlar space happy hallucinating soon nt matter warp drives commission go enough supplies month good would sublight speeds breathed deeply whispered short prayer started shutting systems ever going happen hoped would happen soon long wait power back would nt take act aggression wanted power could attack sort pirates waiting salvage little debris left fleet suddenly ship jerked almost reached power thinking attacked hesitated explosions lights nt attack ship moving nt possible unless something pulling

ships bay looked like sort transport one star drives standing side people baggy black uniforms must ships security couple appeared like sons linhrlar others creatures unlike anything ever seen ship came rest directly front reception committee pushed canopy open button kept eye group whole time one group stood wide shouldered nonalien features long hair like high commander clean shaven like warrior stood middle flanked either side dark skinned creatures nonaliens one thing noted carried side arms another thing strange occurred creatures apparently females strange creatures bring females

flowing behind dark skinned nonalien approached handed two small devices way motioned appeared one place ear around neck disk front throat could trap something could control sir utlin hesitated waiting kind explanation also rested one hand comfortably near battle blaster finally man long gray black hair stepped forward holding small device hand well come aboard uss vigilante said device hand sort translator captain anthony believe ve already spoken sir utlin snapped attention saluted including slight bow head sir utlin robethan first officer carrier star controller commander red wing tactical fighter squadron debt hospitality captain captain though obviously unfamiliar salute immediately returned said box hand would make communication much easier could use devices given indicated objects sir utlin still held right hand ll allow computer translate automatically sir utlin considered devises carefully seemed harmless started piece ear lot better contraption captain said apparently sir utlin language marvelous device strapped piece around neck fit like piece jewelry piece suppose said rest room smiled recognized question heard language still device translates rest us inconveniencing slightly rest crew wear translators us captain said rest introductions captain continued indicated short dark skinned female creature standing next first officer commander tarva sir utlin looked creature almost looked normal forehead rolled slightly hair started top head looked like cross children linhrlar even uglier creatures standing considered her moment decided since indicated second command would treat would wish treated aboard star controller gave stiff salute slight bow given captain commander tarva comfortably returned nt say anything may inquire captain said name used addressed given simple names obviously addressed one another given full title people would know proper salute people translator changed words nt indicated customs officially addressed sir utlin said formally good sir utlin captain said another creature came looked almost normal completely bald pointed ears slight green complexion man approached captain anthony indicated said sir utlin commander norton charge security vigilante commander norton sir utlin said repeated salute norton retuned salute without hesitation turned captain sir may captain looked slightly unsure said course commander norton turned back sir utlin sir going ask side arm time utlin hesitated second decided really nt ask pulled holster handed commander norton took weapon bowed slightly handed one creatures standing nearby captain said ll come us much discuss get settled believe sir utlin agreed followed group hanger left noticed technicians circling fighter scanning devices appeared keeping respectful distance sign going treated might bad entered nearby room long table end rows chairs facing kind seminar meeting room sir utlin ushered one chairs captain anthony tarva norton also took seats two ugly ridged dark skinned creatures took guard positions either side door get started perhaps tell perhaps answer obvious questions asked captain said sounds like good way start utlin agreed anthony could begin piping sound came ceiling bridge captain anthony came female voice anthony go ahead sir borg back scanner range good maintain distance aye sir returned voice speaker obviously turned utlin looked slightly alarmed borg returned anthony said jumped warp follow soon bay nt feel acceleration utlin returned captain smiled proudly rarely captain anthony proceeded tell sir utlin federation encounter borg also told development vigilante spy gather information finally presence battle infuriated sir utlin mean sat back watched remains people get destroyed evil creatures nothing could kind creatures battle seemed weigh heavily crew vigilante allegations obviously disturbed would us anthony asked coldly could helped us obviously sort weapons sir utlin insisted yes weapons similar ships think end could made difference anthony speaking carefully could done something maybe helped destroy one things sir utlin knew taken blaster must predicted anger anthony sat back obviously disturbed events nt know much decision weighs staff us personally affected borg anthony shook kind memories duty people depending us return information may able use defeat borg valiantly engage hopeless battle would betrayed whole federation depending us best return intelligence need anthony looked sir utlin carefully hoping see sort understanding utlin sat back considered captain anthony argument tried put place warrior tough understand sitting battle perhaps point put ones civilization another dying one caring needs civilization suppose utlin said slowly understand reasons would cause stay battle hesitated continued also understand pain helplessness warriors must felt said sir utlin suddenly felt closeness people inner conflicts must endure prayed linhrlar would look cleared commander tarva said must make decisions sir utlin tried best talk female creature captain anthony spoke tarva could answer sir utlin must excuse duties must attend fully understand captain sir utlin said stood anthony leave capable hands commander tarva know able help find proper place among us captain anthony turned exited time commander norton excused took guards sir utlin soon found alone creature second command ship uneasy thought female war ship female alien charge one would take real getting used looked took seat across seemed short even compared comrades confident reason second command took seat spoke said decisions make first like permission examine repair fighter finally reach destination may wish use mean nt examined yet sir utlin sounded slightly surprised tarva smiled ve done without touching strict instructions respect property personal property like retrieve technicians start working utlin decided see far could push good re going figure several options could chose wish tarva said remaining business like get chose fate sir utlin asked surprised course want among us want brings us first option could repair craft send way sir utlin frowned thought literally place go wish could take borg let fight battle guess similar first option tarva mentioning options knowing full well sir utlin probably would nt seriously consider less drastic options asked giving lead continue take observers vigilante tarva said therefore chose remain join crew crew made diverse number different peoples different cultures chose join us accept accept mission goals however try work find position worthy skills experience sound acceptable like asked know trust wo nt work agenda tarva leaned forward sir utlin could see fire creatures eyes sent chill spine stand part crew part team room deal infractions harshest manners sir utlin keep swallowing hard perhaps would better future wish leave vigilante long departure would adversely effect mission could prevent tendering resignation tarva said simply time think sir utlin asked perhaps sometime get better feel people course nt know borg get going may time become proper member crew next emergency ll risk tarva said lets get set quarters good sir utlin said stood commander tarva walked room two guards room waiting side door first place went shuttle bay sir utlins fighter flanked several guards came attention approached several techs continued walk around craft hand scanners sir utlin climbed cockpit removed things first long straight sword behind seat pack apparently personal gear approached commander tarva talking large bearded man sir utlin wore sword seldom used loop belt carried bag approached sir utlin commander tarva said commander dolittel chief engineer charge repairs craft sir utlin could properly salute commander dolittel held hand said welcome aboard knowing proper response sir utlin held hand reply commander dolittel took hold hand firm grip shook saying ca nt wait take look fighter nt worry get flying better new hope sir utlin said knowing respond man ll excuse permission like get work dolittel said letting go utlin hand thank sir utlin could think say dolittel walked away utlin could see motioning technicians heading toward fighter looked tarva questioningly must apologize informality chief engineer great military man gifted engineer tarva said headed toward door lets see find proper quarters sir utlin assigned called junior officers quarters two rooms two bunks one tarva explained singles available next best thing since would room mate commander tarva took time show different features room including replicator head showed access computer verbally get list foods things available replicator nt sure worked intrigued technology commander tarva took tour ship including small bridge would difficult believe ship size could run effectively small place seemed working fine also shown shuttle bay called cavern seemed quite proud size paled comparison star controller also showed several rooms called transporters nt quite clear function sure would find finally decided functions shown best suited security something called drop ships would look closely make clear however within normal mission parameters place fighter though powerful weapons lacked technology vital maintaining mission integrity tarva assured unless somebody specifically challenged access ship within reason course decided visit place gathering commander tarva pointed sort cafeteria tarva even suggested visiting place get feel crew sat place short time two nonalien looking

sir ve finished repairs warp drives currently running systems checks combining two technologies ship able maintain warp extended period time ship seems retrofitted extremely powerful blasters integrate warp technology anthony looked utlin apparently explanation utlin smiled proudly friend mine designed based technology used lord dowe cannons make excellent thesis next submission star fleet

many buttons display screens pedestal panel covered thick layer dust panel dark ever used used whitecloud said perhaps use access computer system lieutenant utlin suggested access computer system access whitecloud returned perhaps panel used said one techs direct computer interface would longer need kind individual control function course whitecloud said looking stock around nt use kind control time well least gives us kind idea old station tarva said radio try activate panel leave one pair study record continue survey aye sir whitecloud said pointed one tech would remain pedestal climbed back deck continue survey far side toward machinery split continued head toward heat noise far side storage room temperature rose slowly noise smell also increased opening next room came sight face shields lower bright light coming room blinding without protection tinted shields opening towered team dry heat blasted team could get closer 100 meters opening even felt like would burned whitecloud asked din foundry replied one technicians looked back stacks beams walking past hour must kind repair facility lieutenant utlin said repair construction whitecloud corrected perhaps utlin agreed need get get closer look re whitecloud said sounds like job armored pressure suits utlin said friend whitecloud responded return utlin asked ll check length room perhaps find another way next

purlerna said ve waiting us tell lords vessel tell must leave place please started begging dropped knees clutching lieutenant utlin around legs please sobbed must leave must long lady purlerna sedated vigilante started slow trek borg system course computer mapped would get borg home world days crew edge entered borg outpost nobody knew borg would react alien vessel entering system would consider irrelevant seemed consider everything else would enough ordinary would warrant investigation nobody seemed notice vigilante traveled cloaking activated assumed speculators borg could defeat cloak remaining question long would take borg come investigate captain anthony commander tarva nearly skeptical crew yet evidence borg sensors could defeat cloaking making preliminary plans surveying exploring borg planet someone signaled door command room entered serlet sir ve tracking movement borg vessels area began captain said turning computer display aside knew serlet would disturb nt important since began final approach borg planet constantly five borg cubes within two hundred million kilometers position captain anthony suddenly interested saying shadowed five borg cubes exactly serlet replied borg flight patterns keep many vessels sphere described mean commander tarva asked mean sir appears shadowed vessels five constantly changing depending looks like normal flight paths could coincidence captain sounded concerned stationary yes serlet said moving still continue center sphere flight paths serlet produced results statistical analysis borg flight paths captain studied data minutes called meeting top command staff obvious borg knew going great lengths show options limited continue current flight plan borg made move exit system possible haste must leave coming back captain said nt arguing choice action brainstorming consequences job fight way borg home world gather intelligence know borg federation could ever dreamed commissioning vigilante get close actually go borg home planet would tantamount failure tarva interjected continue ignore us adjustment flight paths way studying anomaly without taking ships away normal operations commander norton spoke normally remained silent meetings unless addressed spoke listened sit discussing intentions borg studying us analyzing us learning us captain turned looked first officer second jumped feet headed bridge dead run ensign captain anthony said loudly plot course system best speed wake sir ensign omalley ventured damn wake get us captain paused thought second plot course head directly away closest borg ships headed captain anthony ordered ship red alert doubt re going let us go peacefully added breath ship already battle stations red alert strapped rough duty seats closed restraints guards security personnel took weapons safety brought full charge people already places silent running hanging waiting fight begin speculate captain said bridge crew pierced cloaking hull scan us without sensors picking sir commander tarva spoke could fully scan us would nt boarded confronted us captain ensign omalley said new course plotted laid sir thank ensign engage full impulse vigilante immediately took sharp ninety degree nose dive even inertial dampening fields maneuver sharp still felt crew anybody strapped seats found scrambling support captain hard time holding back smile ensign omalley plotted exact course asked threw ship ordered many commanders would least annoyed kind behavior given ensign lecture second guessing emergency proved learned lesson well also showed great self confidence looking approval drastic maneuver captain course knew cleared way asking see course ordering tomorrow comes captain anthony thought lot notations make personnel records vigilante sudden change course velocity borg vessels immediately broke flight paths headed toward ship vigilante dodged debris field borg system full impulse path direct open space calculated put much distance possible ship borg vigilante using star system buffer borg craft borg took immediate pursuit within two minutes could detect eight borg cubes heading toward vicinity vigilante exit system sir serlet spoke reading low level resitron pulse emanating borg outposts pulse acting like motion detector borg track tarva turned chair toward young vulcan work outposts sending resitron signal outposts system accurately charted able detect new movement object serlet consoled beep looked new readings sir said new data indicates subspace force field connecting outposts vicinity effect us tarva asked uncertain analyzing need commander norton said minimally subspace force field type rip away deflector shields may rupture hull captain began typing console ensign omallley entering new course aye plotting new course young woman responded laid new orders bridge could see omalley tense translated new heading could nt help quick questioning glance shoulder captain engage expected vigilante make another sharp turn change nt noticeable twelve borg vessel converging previous exit point someone offered captain brought chart screen one omalley screens ensign way system captain anthony said going take precision flying part hope ready hope sir ensign omalley returned forced smile object soon appeared middle main view screen commander tarva leaned forward looking image screen one outposts correct captain anthony said pointed diagram monitor pointed outer section superstructure take vigilante avoid force field sir tarva said quietly sure make speed re going nt captain returned hushed tone reading activity outpost ensign omalley reported borg ships deploying station steady goes captain anthony said maintain course eta serlet spoke sir eta outpost three minutes fifty seconds mark thank anthony turned back omalley precisely one minute thirty seconds structure begin evasive maneuvers diagoalpha diagoalpha aye sir omalley confirmed commander tarva turned commander norton prepare counter measures release initiation maneuver working norton replied quickly entered orders console resitron tracking sensitive think know need crew vigilante time seemed stand still nt duties perform watched image borg outpost rushing toward bridge crew knew pending diagoalpha maneuvers rest seemed rushing head first lion den ships deploying outpost formed grid front structure started heading toward sir serlet reported sweeping us thank ensign captain anthony replied said change evasive maneuvers diagbeta initiate mark diagbeta omalley responded aye sir captain anthony command vigilante started series evasive maneuver design first series low power photon torpedoes launched detonate sequentially carrying signature vigilante momentum forward also hoped explosions would overload resitron receptors help blind borg seconds vigilante made run superstructure outpost vigilante cut speed made series sharp course changes photon torpedoes continued detonate along ship former path vigilante dropped cubes soon beyond ships borg immediately focused attention vigilante old path counter measures crew watched old flight path filled energy charges tractor beams borg ships nice job ensign anthony said take us aye sir starting final run omalley replied prepare jump warp soon exit anthony told bridge evasive pattern romeoone vigilante increased speed headed toward right side structure computer given task adjusting speed direction based scans outposts outpost varied design others could disaster vigilante ship weaved around surface structures station every course change speed adjustment predetermined maps made first outpost hopefully corrected fly incoming data approaching final obstacle crew ready jump warp totally clear structure hold speed captain said ca nt see us side nt want give away jumping soon matter seconds clearing last structure clearing station totally beats time took free station eternity ship barely flexing flung away borg system warp sign pursuit commander tarva asked praying negative reply response ship rocked hard port lights dimmed instant continue evasive sequence anthony said turned toward commander norton read two borg cubes immediate area norton replied reading directly reports screen holding warp nine firing randomly front lets see captain anthony said turning toward main screen stabilized rear view coming sir norton responded screen showed two borg ships appeared moving synchronized dance left right across screen apparent movement caused vigilante evasive maneuvers without computer stabilization picture would complete blur two someone wondered aloud coded clearance appeared commander tarva screen captain commander norton fire control target closest cube prepare delivery sequence shelbyone said without turning attention commands screen second command vigilante commander tarva given many firing codes instead captain attempt decentralize command case capture commander hold fire captain said helm increase speed warp nine point three captain anthony hoping vigilante could get away borg without fight knew could nt defeat borg wanted avoid leaving system fire fight vigilante increased speed lieutenant serlet spoke captain may able vigilante shook violently lurched hard port soon ship started shake commander tarva started yelling fire fire vigilante released stream photon torpedoes directly borg ship behind time beamed dozens specially prepared torpedoes directly interior ship torpedoes fired cube minimal effect served distraction torpedoes beamed strategic locations throughout structure photon torpedoes exploded predefined pattern called shelby sequence commander shelby one foremost authorities borg suggested main power conduits could disrupted exactly right pattern could create feedback resonance would destroy ship borg immediately started experiencing trouble dropped warp vigilante trouble one noticed one pursuers dropped light years behind star ship dropped speed spun wildly course maintain warp captain anthony yelled continue evasive maneuvers engineering status tarva cross talked captain ordering targeting second cube ve sustained damage warp nacelle one came commander dolittel voice engineering unable establish transporter lock cube interior commander norton reported added shields seventy five percent cloaking operative damage stableized dolittel echoed background holding warp nine helm reported commotion hell happened captain demanded increase velocity registered borg motion detectors able triangulate us serlet reported speaking quickly could sir ensign omalley spoke read ten borg ships headed direction high warp catch us five minutes shiv captain anthony said loudly started entering new commands console helm entering new course aye sir came simple reply engage vigilante immediately dropped warp changed heading straight instant ship continued old course saucer section pointing closer cube immediately light years beyond ships also shooting vigilante used acceleration advantage jumping directly warp 96 time held straight course trying put much distance borg possible bridge came dolittel voice engineering know maintain speed damaged nacelle might hold wo nt long captain replied prepare controlled worm hole anthony finished speaking vigilante shudder lights flickered sir re losing speed ensign omalley reported engineering captain yelled intercom whats going lost nacelle one dolittel reported nacelle two also line resonance synchronization problems warp nacelles could operated matched pairs recelebrating two nacelle operation last maneuver borg become extremely strung precise location vigilante one ship area able zero interference radiation generated failing nacelle ship approached slowly still unable pin point intruder stop captain anthony commanded initiate jamming tarva said watched ship approach jamming devices designed blind borg scanners mask borg link vigilante drifted borg ship passed area crew watched borg main view screen silence ship passed beyond vigilante still within jamming range turned back anthony signalled engineering full speed full speed came dolittel reply acceleration effected slightly wo nt able hold top speed indefinitely controlled wormhole tarva put aye still operational dolittel returned approaching vigilante position borg began intense offfrequency sensor sweep area cube heading directly toward ship would pass extremely close prepare jump warp nine point six command anthony told crew borg passed beyond closest point ship came dead stop sensors vigilante told whole area intense study borg crew leaned forward watching borg closely wait see passed jump hope run maintain nine point six well captain anthony said commander tarva looked questioningly lets see pass helm prepared warp get closer sir ready power buildup closest face cube serlet reported get us anthony said tractor beam sprang borg ship aimed directly damaged nacelle vigilante jumped warp nine point six time avoid beam borg immediately took pursuit prepare controlled worm hole anthony commanded ve got get triangulate us vigilante rocked borg latched tractor beam beam locked solidly deflector shields around disabled nacelle ve established tractor beam lock re dropping warp commander norton reported targeting weapons fire anthony said get us first time ever vigilante phasers fired anger high powered phaser banks fired rippling effect cloaking heavy damage cubes superstructure tractor beam held tight time vigilante torpedo delivery systems targeted cube launched torpedoes aimed source tractor beam sights taking damage phasers tractor beam area heavily shielded torpedoes significant damage heavy damage continued inflicted areas phasers could reach beam held tight internally torpedoes beamed achieve shelby sequence noticeable damage another beam came borg ship high powered cutting beam immediately struck shields top nacelles next tractor beam vigilante shuddered lost power many low priority systems computer tried maintain shields shields forty five percent commander norton reported disengage cloaking captain anthony said save energy know re current rate shields fail five minutes commander norton said sir serlet yes captain said quickly glance toward young vulcan may able escape shields fail explain borg still nt dealt vigilante hull material energy absorbing nature tractor beam may effective bare hull captain looked security chief think solid hypothesis based current data norton said data conclusive cutting beam commander tarva asked oh serlet said almost nonchalantly ll take direct hit engine room one tarva immediately signaled evacuation engine room one emergency lock engine room two personnel evacuated engine room one non essential personnel engine room two remaining personnel stayed rough duty chairs would automatically drop safety emergency knew would nt happen since er two failed would safety prepare drop shields anthony commanded helm engineering ready warp soon cut rear shields captain anthony sat back braced could sense rest bridge crew ship tense lights dimmed power strain two beams phaser torpedo fire continued pour vigilante considerably less effect vigilante dropped rear shields lights seemed brighten instant immediately however cutting beam hit craft amid ships near saucer section much energy dissipated hull engine room one still engulfed fire explosions borg tractor beam much less focused needed time adjust new target vigilante needed instantly sight borg single minded immediately took strange little ship commander dolittel several technicians worked feverishly engine room control center looked areas evacuated engine room one engulfed flame high power electrical discharges instant borg struck ship functions already diverted engine room two vigilante still felt massive power loss damage seconds strike commander dolittel closed blast shields control room engine room one failing monitors watched one two advanced engine rooms star fleet burn another problem started shutting alpha warp core soon evacuation ordered nt nearly enough time team could release energy building damaged coils knew matter minutes total breach sirens howled around commander dolittel signaled bridge less two minutes warp core breach reported prepare ejection alpha warp core anti matter pods dolittel glanced stats beta core pushing 98 capacity continuing work ejection signaled bridge stats beta core count ejection alpha core 10 vigilante held warp eight bridge crew watched countdown ejection alpha core watched borg gaining knew one card left play prepare controlled worm hole anthony yelled explosive charges released alpha core exterior hull plates vigilante plates nt time separate ship blown away much larger explosions expelling alpha core antimatter pods ship rocked radical maneuver maintained power thanks beta core picture approaching borg ship soon obliterated exploding warp core silently hoped cube would destroyed disabled explosion quickly emerged cloud unscathed bridge dolittel came voice intercom commander anthony called back controlled wormhole sir mess dolittel returned theres way implement worm hole control read five borg ship closing fast serlet reported background nt care control anthony yelled bearded face monitor get us nearest borg ship close enough fire vigilante sustained sufficient damage effect targeting systems first bursts energy missed vigilante would use misses adjust sighting ensign omalley trying run setup routines worm hole console next getting response suddenly ship filled loud siren none recognized first ten second warning wormhole dolittel ride every safety precaution built controlled wormhole easy working engineering main console captain nt seem care went long away dolittel quite agreed strapping rough duty seat looked engine room watched crew scramble chairs god hope make thought frowned god hope make hit brick wall least felt like captain anthony nt sure happened everything flew felt crush chair bridge wrapped around began spiral front looked like long tunnel view screen stars far end tunneling felt like drilling hole body felt like would blown apart vigilante purposely breached alignments warp coils pursuing borg ship extremely close artificial wormhole created breach sucked large borg ship starship sized corridor cube collapsed like water flowing funnel pain surged everybody vigilante felt like every blood vessel bodies exploded captain anthony gasped breath fumbled release restraints bridge almost black except faint red emergency lighting wormhole control systems emergency power cut offs case accidents may disabled implement maneuver captain anthony felt extremely light headed nt know injuries loss gravity got restraints removed tried stand felt like seat dropped away nt free fall gravity minimal bridge engineering captain said looking around bridge status bridge crew slowly gaining consciousness debris hung ceiling littered deck bridge engineering report anthony tried still response captain anthony made one bridge engineering stations tried run diagnostics bridge station report came commander tarvas voice behind anthony captain looked back first officer neglected bridge crew knowing status ship important one short kalonian working free restraints trying raise rest ship time diagnostics nt look good minimal power looked safety rides worm hole totally shut beta warp core nt good captain anthony said softly bridge crew slowly gaining consciousness commander tarva able raise several sections vigilante engineering anthony said get away borg answer question vigilante rocked great thud whole crew scrambled support looked trying show fear feeling ship rocked antony demand attack crew tried every station answers none responded power loss total external sensors ship rocked third time captain anthony commander tarva scrambled command room prying door open contend blast shields manual controls designed emergencies maintenance getting one shield half open small area looking across rear ship vigilante floated blackness pin points light distant stars nt enough tell contact drop bays anthony said yes sir tarva replied tell turn emergency landing beacons might give us enough light see another thudding sound echoed ship commander kartang reports minutes worth battery power tarva report large communicator plenty anthony said tarva put communicator away bring tricorder leaned look window captain absence light even smallest amount seem like sun rise straight back light suddenly came hull dropped shuttle bays captain anthony commander tarva grimaced saw first right hull scorched black cracks radiated center strike upper port nacelle large hole blown front shattered side wires debris dangled first saw sign hitting vigilante finally saw large chunk debris slowly float darkness glance side ship hit dull thud echoed starship soon hit lights shuttle bay faded went get anthony asked yes sir tarva replied holding tricorder show clear picture object struck ship two headed bridge heard computers begin come back line tarva went straight serlet help identifying debris captain anthony tried signalling engineering intercom filled static step forward voice broke though ridge comm dolit damage worm casualties ower line minutes dolittel speaking quickly get message communication lost captain anthony turned one technicians nearby get find exactly status turned someone else try set computer link engineering maybe get information way anybody tell yet anthony said looking around whole bridge ensign omalley spoke sir established link stellar cartography working location main computers still may take awhile ok ensign keep working sir commander tarva yes commander ve tentatively identified debris saw tarva reported captain asked figured part vigilante could nt see piece recorded fragment borg ship tarva reported ve also enhanced pictures show space around us tarva showed captain anthony tricorder screen showed vigilante floating cloud debris apparently serlet offered cube followed us worm hole torn apart process captain looked picture smiled guess nt fit ship rocked another strike nt get shields back soon damned borg ship may still end us anthony said frustration main lights came everyone suddenly felt much less light headed bridge engineering came commander dolittels voice intercom go ahead commander tarva replied main power back line shields eight percent ve sustained major damage drive systems able repair dolittel reported currently working getting impulse drives back line get maneuverability back warp drives tarva asked hard say commander able get nacelles three four line full capacity top speed probably around warp seven top sustainable speed around warp five controlled worm hole captain asked dryly sir commander dolittel returned last jump controlled gets control worm hole high warp capability captain anthony summarized hope landed somewhere near federation else could long ride home ensign omalley looked console glazed look eyes sir determined present location far side gamma quadrant gamma quadrant tarva asked disbelief would go right alpha quadrant get someone said sir serlet offered high warp gamma quadrant eighty years federation space thank lieutenant know captain anthony said dropped heavily chair know find us place pity breast let us last embrace earth sunhallowed rest night claw upon brain oh see sun sunshine robert service
